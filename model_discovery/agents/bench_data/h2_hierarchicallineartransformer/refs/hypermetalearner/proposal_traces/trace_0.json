Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

HyperPrompt: Prompt-based Task-Conditioning of Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention*\n\n*Yun He, H. Zheng, Yi Tay, Jai Gupta, Yu Du, V. Aribandi, Zhe Zhao, Yaguang Li, Zhaoji Chen, Donald Metzler, Heng-Tze Cheng, Ed H. Chi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers, which can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt-Tuning is a new paradigm for finetuning pre-trained language models in a parameter-efficient way. Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks. We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as $0.14\\%$ of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. Learning to Jointly Share and Prune Weights for Grounding Based Vision and Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Burak Uzkent, Yilin Shen, Heng Huang, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers and proposes to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been successful in processing different data modalities, such as language and image data, which could use transformers with similar architectures to achieve good performance. Leveraging this observation, we propose weight sharing across two transformer backbones and within the same transformer backbone and pruning across two backbones in a unified framework. More specifically, we investigate weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: (1) Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and (2) Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. To jointly perform weight sharing and pruning, we propose to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step. The structure vectors of sharing and pruning are generated by using a hypernetwork, which can capture complex interactions between pruning and sharing across layers and modalities. We train the hypernetwork and model weights iteratively so that the learned structure evolves along with model weights. After minimizing the proposed objective in pre-training step, we perform weight sharing and pruning and fine-tune the compressed model on downstream tasks. Finally, we perform experiments on vision and language tasks, including Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Object Detection using the state-of-the-art grounding based models: MDETR and GLIP. Our experiments show that we can compress these models by 35\u2212 40% by sharing and pruning MSA and FFN weights without almost any loss in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Rethinking Individual Global Max in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention*\n\n*Yi-Te Hong, Yaochu Jin, Yang Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to adopt an imitation learning strategy to separate the lossy decomposition from Bellman iterations, thereby avoiding error accumulation and outperforms state-of-the-art IGM-based approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, centralized training and decentralized execution (CTDE) has achieved remarkable success. Individual Global Max (IGM) decomposition, which is an important element of CTDE, measures the consistency between local and joint policies. The majority of IGM-based research focuses on how to establish this consistent relationship, but little attention has been paid to examining IGM's potential flaws. In this work, we reveal that the IGM condition is a lossy decomposition, and the error of lossy decomposition will accumulated in hypernetwork-based methods. To address the above issue, we propose to adopt an imitation learning strategy to separate the lossy decomposition from Bellman iterations, thereby avoiding error accumulation. The proposed strategy is theoretically proved and empirically verified on the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge benchmark problem with zero sight view. The results also confirm that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art IGM-based approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models*\n\n*Abdul Fatir Ansari, Alvin Heng, Andre Lim, Harold Soh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations and proposes three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Stefano*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is verified that inr2vec can embed effectively the 3D shapes represented by the input INRs and shown how the produced embeddings can be fed into deep learning pipelines to solve several tasks by processing exclusively INRs.\n\n**Abstract:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged in the last few years as a powerful tool to encode continuously a variety of different signals like images, videos, audio and 3D shapes. When applied to 3D shapes, INRs allow to overcome the fragmentation and shortcomings of the popular discrete representations used so far. Yet, considering that INRs consist in neural networks, it is not clear whether and how it may be possible to feed them into deep learning pipelines aimed at solving a downstream task. In this paper, we put forward this research problem and propose inr2vec, a framework that can compute a compact latent representation for an input INR in a single inference pass. We verify that inr2vec can embed effectively the 3D shapes represented by the input INRs and show how the produced embeddings can be fed into deep learning pipelines to solve several tasks by processing exclusively INRs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Modality-Agnostic Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations\n\n*From Search Query: implicit neural representations*\n\n*Jonathan Schwarz, Jihoon Tack, Y. Teh, Jaeho Lee, Jinwoo Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** VC-INR is introduced as the first INR-based method to outperform codecs as well-known and diverse as JPEG 2000, MP3 and AVC/HEVC on their respective modalities.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a modality-agnostic neural compression algorithm based on a functional view of data and parameterised as an Implicit Neural Representation (INR). Bridging the gap between latent coding and sparsity, we obtain compact latent representations non-linearly mapped to a soft gating mechanism. This allows the specialisation of a shared INR network to each data item through subnetwork selection. After obtaining a dataset of such latent representations, we directly optimise the rate/distortion trade-off in a modality-agnostic space using neural compression. Variational Compression of Implicit Neural Representations (VC-INR) shows improved performance given the same representational capacity pre quantisation while also outperforming previous quantisation schemes used for other INR techniques. Our experiments demonstrate strong results over a large set of diverse modalities using the same algorithm without any modality-specific inductive biases. We show results on images, climate data, 3D shapes and scenes as well as audio and video, introducing VC-INR as the first INR-based method to outperform codecs as well-known and diverse as JPEG 2000, MP3 and AVC/HEVC on their respective modalities.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Attention as a Hypernetwork\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention*\n\n*Razvan Pascanu, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Yassir Akram, Seijin Kobayashi, Simon Schug*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is predictive of the subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions revealing that latent codes acquired during training are reused to solve unseen problem instances. To further examine the hypothesis that the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention supports compositional generalization, we ablate whether making the hypernetwork generated linear value network nonlinear strengthens compositionality. We find that this modification improves compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven Progressive Matrices human intelligence test which gives us precise control over the problem compositions encountered during training and evaluation. We demonstrate on this task how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization in transformers and gives rise to a functionally structured latent space.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Cream of the Crop: Distilling Prioritized Paths For One-Shot Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention*\n\n*Jianlong Fu, Jing Liao, Qi Li, Hongyuan Yu, Hao Du, Houwen Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** One-shot weight sharing methods have recently drawn great attention in neural architecture search due to high efficiency and competitive performance. However, weight sharing across models has an inherent deficiency, i.e., insufficient training of subnetworks in hypernetworks. To alleviate this problem, we present a simple yet effective architecture distillation method. The central idea is that subnetworks can learn collaboratively and teach each other throughout the training process, aiming to boost the convergence of individual models. We introduce the concept of prioritized path, which refers to the architecture candidates exhibiting superior performance during training. Distilling knowledge from the prioritized paths is able to boost the training of subnetworks. Since the prioritized paths are changed on the fly depending on their performance and complexity, the final obtained paths are the cream of the crop. We directly select the most promising one from the prioritized paths as the final architecture, without using other complex search methods, such as reinforcement learning or evolution algorithms. The experiments on ImageNet verify such path distillation method can improve the convergence ratio and performance of the hypernetwork, as well as boosting the training of subnetworks. The discovered architectures achieve superior performance compared to the recent MobileNetV3 and EfficientNet families under aligned settings. Moreover, the experiments on object detection and more challenging search space show the generality and robustness of the proposed method.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\n\n*From Search Query: implicit neural representations*\n\n*Julien N. P. Martel, Gordon Wetzstein, Alexander W. Bergman, Vincent Sitzmann, David B. Lindell*\n\n**Abstract:** Implicitly defined, continuous, differentiable signal representations parameterized by neural networks have emerged as a powerful paradigm, offering many possible benefits over conventional representations. However, current network architectures for such implicit neural representations are incapable of modeling signals with fine detail, and fail to represent a signal's spatial and temporal derivatives, despite the fact that these are essential to many physical signals defined implicitly as the solution to partial differential equations. We propose to leverage periodic activation functions for implicit neural representations and demonstrate that these networks, dubbed sinusoidal representation networks or Sirens, are ideally suited for representing complex natural signals and their derivatives. We analyze Siren activation statistics to propose a principled initialization scheme and demonstrate the representation of images, wavefields, video, sound, and their derivatives. Further, we show how Sirens can be leveraged to solve challenging boundary value problems, such as particular Eikonal equations (yielding signed distance functions), the Poisson equation, and the Helmholtz and wave equations. Lastly, we combine Sirens with hypernetworks to learn priors over the space of Siren functions.\n\n**Conference:** implicit-neural-representations-with-periodic-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. Animatable Implicit Neural Representations for Creating Realistic Avatars from Videos\n\n*From Search Query: implicit neural representations*\n\n*Qing Shuai, Shangzhan Zhang, Qianqian Wang, Junting Dong, Xiaowei Zhou, Hujun Bao, Zhen Xu, Sida Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the challenge of reconstructing an animatable human model from a multi-view video. Some recent works have proposed to decompose a non-rigidly deforming scene into a canonical neural radiance field and a set of deformation fields that map observation-space points to the canonical space, thereby enabling them to learn the dynamic scene from images. However, they represent the deformation field as translational vector field or SE(3) field, which makes the optimization highly under-constrained. Moreover, these representations cannot be explicitly controlled by input motions. Instead, we introduce a pose-driven deformation field based on the linear blend skinning algorithm, which combines the blend weight field and the 3D human skeleton to produce observation-to-canonical correspondences. Since 3D human skeletons are more observable, they can regularize the learning of the deformation field. Moreover, the pose-driven deformation field can be controlled by input skeletal motions to generate new deformation fields to animate the canonical human model. Experiments show that our approach significantly outperforms recent human modeling methods.

This is discussed in the context of Stable Diffusion, where hypernetworks are used to steer results towards specific directions.\n- A more direct application can be found in the paper on \"Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism\" which, although not explicitly using hypernetworks, introduces a probabilistic approach to attention weights. This could be combined with hypernetworks to generate these probabilistic distributions dynamically.\n\n### Efficient State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- Efficient state-space models are highlighted as a method to capture long-range dependencies with lower computational complexity. The paper \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed\" suggests that not all attention layers are equally critical, and some can be simplified or pruned, which aligns with the efficiency goals of SSMs.\n- The concept of linear attention mechanisms, which reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear, is relevant here. This approach can be integrated with state-space models to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Implicit Neural Representations\n\n- Implicit neural representations, particularly those using periodic activation functions, can capture high-frequency details and complex patterns efficiently. This could enhance the expressiveness of the attention mechanism, allowing it to model intricate relationships in the data more effectively.\n\n### Specific References and Insights\n\n- **Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism (GPAM):**\n  - This mechanism introduces a probabilistic approach to attention weights, which can be combined with hypernetworks to generate these weights dynamically. GPAM also includes a new attention-based information aggregation method, which could be optimized using efficient state-space models.\n\n- **Hypernetworks in Stable Diffusion:**\n  - The use of hypernetworks in Stable Diffusion to condition and adapt the model's behavior can serve as a blueprint for adapting attention mechanisms in language models. Hypernetworks can generate weights for different parts of the model based on input context.\n\n- **Efficiency in Transformers:**\n  - The paper \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed\" provides insights into which attention layers are critical and which can be simplified or pruned. This can help in designing more efficient state-space models for attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Implicit Neural Representations:**\n  - The work on implicit neural representations with periodic activation functions offers a way to capture complex patterns efficiently. This can be integrated into the attention mechanism to enhance its expressiveness and ability to model intricate relationships.\n\n### Next Steps and Considerations\n\n- **Integrate Hypernetworks with GPAM:**\n  - Explore how hypernetworks can be used to generate the probabilistic attention distributions introduced in GPAM. This could enhance the adaptability and expressiveness of the attention mechanism.\n\n- **Optimize with Efficient State-Space Models:**\n  - Investigate how state-space models can be used to reduce the computational complexity of the attention mechanism while maintaining or improving its performance.\n\n- **Implement and Evaluate:**\n  - Assess the computational overhead and performance improvements of integrating hypernetworks and efficient state-space models into the attention mechanism.\n  - Ensure that the modifications do not compromise the model's accuracy and robustness.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages hypernetworks, efficient state-space models, and implicit neural representations to enhance the attention mechanism, potentially leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

HyperPrompt: Prompt-based Task-Conditioning of Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork transformers*\n\n*Yun He, H. Zheng, Yi Tay, Jai Gupta, Yu Du, V. Aribandi, Zhe Zhao, Yaguang Li, Zhaoji Chen, Donald Metzler, Heng-Tze Cheng, Ed H. Chi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers, which can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt-Tuning is a new paradigm for finetuning pre-trained language models in a parameter-efficient way. Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks. We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as $0.14\\%$ of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. HyperGrid Transformers: Towards A Single Model for Multiple Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork transformers*\n\n*Yi Tay, Zhe Zhao, Dara Bahri, Donald Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes HyperGrid Transformers, a new Transformer architecture that leverages task-conditioned hyper networks for controlling its feed-forward layers and proposes a decomposable hypernetwork that learns grid-wise projections that help to specialize regions in weight matrices for different tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Achieving state-of-the-art performance on natural language understanding tasks typically relies on fine-tuning a fresh model for every task. Consequently, this approach leads to a higher overall parameter cost, along with higher technical maintenance for serving multiple models. Learning a single multi-task model that is able to do well for all the tasks has been a challenging and yet attractive proposition. In this paper, we propose HyperGrid Transformers, a new Transformer architecture that leverages task-conditioned hyper networks for controlling its feed-forward layers. Specifically, we propose a decomposable hypernetwork that learns grid-wise projections that help to specialize regions in weight matrices for different tasks. In order to construct the proposed hypernetwork, our method learns the interactions and composition between a global (task-agnostic) state and a local task-specific state. We conduct an extensive set of experiments on GLUE/SuperGLUE. On the SuperGLUE test set, we match the performance of the state-of-the-art while being 16 times more parameter efficient. Our method helps bridge the gap between fine-tuning and multi-task learning approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Learning to Jointly Share and Prune Weights for Grounding Based Vision and Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork transformers*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Burak Uzkent, Yilin Shen, Heng Huang, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers and proposes to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been successful in processing different data modalities, such as language and image data, which could use transformers with similar architectures to achieve good performance. Leveraging this observation, we propose weight sharing across two transformer backbones and within the same transformer backbone and pruning across two backbones in a unified framework. More specifically, we investigate weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: (1) Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and (2) Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. To jointly perform weight sharing and pruning, we propose to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step. The structure vectors of sharing and pruning are generated by using a hypernetwork, which can capture complex interactions between pruning and sharing across layers and modalities. We train the hypernetwork and model weights iteratively so that the learned structure evolves along with model weights. After minimizing the proposed objective in pre-training step, we perform weight sharing and pruning and fine-tune the compressed model on downstream tasks. Finally, we perform experiments on vision and language tasks, including Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Object Detection using the state-of-the-art grounding based models: MDETR and GLIP. Our experiments show that we can compress these models by 35\u2212 40% by sharing and pruning MSA and FFN weights without almost any loss in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: state-space attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. SPACE: Single-round Participant Amalgamation for Contribution Evaluation in Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: state-space attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yi-Chung Chen, Hsi-Wen Chen, Shun-Gui Wang, Ming-Syan Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results demonstrate that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both running time and Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient.\n\n**Abstract:** The evaluation of participant contribution in federated learning (FL) has recently gained significant attention due to its applicability in various domains, such as incentive mechanisms, robustness enhancement, and client selection. Previous approaches have predominantly relied on the widely adopted Shapley value for participant evaluation. However, the computation of the Shapley value is expensive, despite using techniques like gradient-based model reconstruction and truncating unnecessary evaluations. Therefore, we present an efficient approach called Single-round Participants Amalgamation for Contribution Evaluation (SPACE). SPACE incorporates two novel components, namely Federated Knowledge Amalgamation and Prototype-based Model Evaluation to reduce the evaluation effort by eliminating the dependence on the size of the validation set and enabling participant evaluation within a single communication round. Experimental results demonstrate that SPACE outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both running time and Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient (PCC). Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted on applications, client reweighting, and client selection highlight the effectiveness of SPACE.

Through a pseudo information highway, we introduce a gated component self-dependency units (SDU) that incorporates LSTM-styled gating units to replenish internal semantic importance within the multi-dimensional latent space of individual representations. The subsidiary content-based SDU gates allow for the information flow of modulated latent embeddings through skipped connections, leading to a clear margin of convergence speed with gradient descent algorithms. We may unveil the role of gating mechanism to aid in the context-based Transformer modules, with hypothesizing that SDU gates, especially on shallow layers, could push it faster to step towards suboptimal points during the optimization process.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Does Momentum Change the Implicit Regularization on Separable Data?\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive implicit neural functions*\n\n*Bohan Wang, Qi Meng, Huishuai Zhang, Ruoyu Sun, Wei Chen, Zhirui Ma, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that on the linear classification problem with separable data and exponential-tailed loss, gradient descent with momentum (GDM) converges to the L2 max-margin solution, which is the same as vanilla gradient descent.\n\n**Abstract:** The momentum acceleration technique is widely adopted in many optimization algorithms. However, there is no theoretical answer on how the momentum affects the generalization performance of the optimization algorithms. This paper studies this problem by analyzing the implicit regularization of momentum-based optimization. We prove that on the linear classification problem with separable data and exponential-tailed loss, gradient descent with momentum (GDM) converges to the L2 max-margin solution, which is the same as vanilla gradient descent. That means gradient descent with momentum acceleration still converges to a low-complexity model, which guarantees their generalization. We then analyze the stochastic and adaptive variants of GDM (i.e., SGDM and deterministic Adam) and show they also converge to the L2 max-margin solution. Technically, to overcome the difficulty of the error accumulation in analyzing the momentum, we construct new potential functions to analyze the gap between the model parameter and the max-margin solution. Numerical experiments are conducted and support our theoretical results.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Temporal Variability in Implicit Online Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive implicit neural functions*\n\n*Nicol\u00f2 Campolongo, Francesco Orabona*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the regret can be constant if the temporal variability is constant and the learning rate is tuned appropriately, without the need of smooth losses, and a novel static regret bound is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** In the setting of online learning, Implicit algorithms turn out to be highly successful from a practical standpoint. However, the tightest regret analyses only show marginal improvements over Online Mirror Descent. In this work, we shed light on this behavior carrying out a careful regret analysis. We prove a novel static regret bound that depends on the temporal variability of the sequence of loss functions, a quantity which is often encountered when considering dynamic competitors. We show, for example, that the regret can be constant if the temporal variability is constant and the learning rate is tuned appropriately, without the need of smooth losses. Moreover, we present an adaptive algorithm that achieves this regret bound without prior knowledge of the temporal variability and prove a matching lower bound. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on classification and regression datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9. Adaptive Bayesian Sampling with Monte Carlo EM\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive implicit neural functions*\n\n*A. Roychowdhury, S. Parthasarathy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This approach provides a simpler alternative, by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a Monte Carlo EM framework, and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel online technique, and achieves sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being significantly faster.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel technique for learning the mass matrices in samplers obtained from discretized dynamics that preserve some energy function. Existing adaptive samplers use Riemannian preconditioning techniques, where the mass matrices are functions of the parameters being sampled. This leads to significant complexities in the energy reformulations and resultant dynamics, often leading to implicit systems of equations and requiring inversion of high-dimensional matrices in the leapfrog steps. Our approach provides a simpler alternative, by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a Monte Carlo EM framework, and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel online technique. We also propose a way to adaptively set the number of samples gathered in the E step, using sampling error estimates from the leapfrog dynamics. Along with a novel stochastic sampler based on Nos\\'{e}-Poincar\\'{e} dynamics, we use this framework with standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as well as newer stochastic algorithms such as SGHMC and SGNHT, and show strong performance on synthetic and real high-dimensional sampling scenarios; we achieve sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being significantly faster.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork transformers*\n\n*James Henderson, Mostafa Dehghani, Sebastian Ruder, Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork transformers*\n\n*Jie Fu, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Boris Knyazev, Xinyu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. LVAC: Learned Volumetric Attribute Compression for Point Clouds using Coordinate Based Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive implicit neural functions*\n\n*George Toderici, Nick Johnston, Sung Jin Hwang, Philip A. Chou, Berivan Isik*\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the attributes of a point cloud as samples of a vector-valued volumetric function at discrete positions. To compress the attributes given the positions, we compress the parameters of the volumetric function. We model the volumetric function by tiling space into blocks, and representing the function over each block by shifts of a coordinate-based, or implicit, neural network. Inputs to the network include both spatial coordinates and a latent vector per block. We represent the latent vectors using coefficients of the region-adaptive hierarchical transform (RAHT) used in the MPEG geometry-based point cloud codec G-PCC. The coefficients, which are highly compressible, are rate-distortion optimized by back-propagation through a rate-distortion Lagrangian loss in an auto-decoder configuration. The result outperforms RAHT by 2--4 dB. This is the first work to compress volumetric functions represented by local coordinate-based neural networks. As such, we expect it to be applicable beyond point clouds, for example to compression of high-resolution neural radiance fields.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-17\n\n\n\n#### 6. Neural Geometric Level of Detail: Real-time Rendering with Implicit 3D Shapes\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive implicit neural functions*\n\n*Sanja Fidler, Morgan McGuire, Alec Jacobson, Derek Nowrouzezahrai, Charles Loop, Karsten Kreis, Kangxue Yin, Joey Litalien, Towaki Takikawa*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural signed distance functions (SDFs) are emerging as an effective representation for 3D shapes. State-of-the-art methods typically encode the SDF with a large, fixed-size neural network to approximate complex shapes with implicit surfaces. Rendering with these large networks is, however, computationally expensive since it requires many forward passes through the network for every pixel, making these representations impractical for real-time graphics. We introduce an efficient neural representation that, for the first time, enables real-time rendering of high-fidelity neural SDFs, while achieving state-of-the-art geometry reconstruction quality. We represent implicit surfaces using an octree-based feature volume which adaptively fits shapes with multiple discrete levels of detail (LODs), and enables continuous LOD with SDF interpolation. We further develop an efficient algorithm to directly render our novel neural SDF representation in real-time by querying only the necessary LODs with sparse octree traversal. We show that our representation is 2-3 orders of magnitude more efficient in terms of rendering speed compared to previous works. Furthermore, it produces state-of-the-art reconstruction quality for complex shapes under both 3D geometric and 2D image-space metrics.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to enhance the `MetaLearner` model by integrating several advanced techniques to improve its adaptability, efficiency, and performance on downstream tasks. Here are the key areas of focus and the most relevant information to help achieve these goals:\n\n### Integrating Hypernetworks\n\n- **Dynamic Attention Weights**: Hypernetworks can generate parameters (weights) of another network dynamically based on input data. The concept of reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, as discussed in **\"Attention as a Hypernetwork\"**, is particularly relevant. This approach allows a low-dimensional latent code to specify key-query specific operations, which can be reused for unseen task compositions, enhancing generalization.\n\n- **HyperPrompt**: The idea of using hyper-prompts for task-conditioning in Transformers, as proposed in **\"HyperPrompt: Prompt-based Task-Conditioning of Transformers\"**, can also be adapted to generate adaptive attention weights conditioned on input embeddings or contextual information.\n\n### Efficient State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Handling Long-Range Dependencies**: Models like the **S4 model** from **\"Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\"** can efficiently handle long sequences by reducing computational complexity. Integrating such SSMs into the MetaLearner can improve its ability to capture long-range dependencies without significant computational overhead.\n\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)**: SMA enables neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements, reducing computation and memory consumption. This mechanism can be applied to the MetaLearner to make it more efficient.\n\n### Implicit Neural Representations (INRs)\n\n- **Periodic Activation Functions**: Using periodic activation functions in INRs can capture high-frequency details efficiently. This could enhance the MetaLearner's capacity to model complex patterns in the data, as discussed in **\"Implicit Neural Representations with Periodic Activation Functions\"**.\n\n- **Implicit Attention Formulation**: Viewing attention mechanisms as implicit functions provides a framework to analyze and improve them. The unified implicit attention formulation for gated-linear recurrent sequence models can help reformulate the MetaLearner to function as an implicit attention layer, potentially improving its adaptability.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism**: This mechanism, proposed in **\"Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\"**, introduces a probabilistic approach to attention, allowing for more nuanced and flexible attention distributions.

Not All Attention is Needed\"** suggests that not all attention layers are equally important.

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Score: 0.93)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention mechanism*\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Interpretable and Generalizable Graph Learning via Stochastic Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention mechanism*\n\n*Siqi Miao, Miaoyuan Liu, Pan Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stoChasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation.\n\n**Abstract:** Interpretable graph learning is in need as many scientific applications depend on learning models to collect insights from graph-structured data. Previous works mostly focused on using post-hoc approaches to interpret pre-trained models (graph neural networks in particular). They argue against inherently interpretable models because the good interpretability of these models is often at the cost of their prediction accuracy. However, those post-hoc methods often fail to provide stable interpretation and may extract features that are spuriously correlated with the task. In this work, we address these issues by proposing Graph Stochastic Attention (GSAT). Derived from the information bottleneck principle, GSAT injects stochasticity to the attention weights to block the information from task-irrelevant graph components while learning stochasticity-reduced attention to select task-relevant subgraphs for interpretation. The selected subgraphs provably do not contain patterns that are spuriously correlated with the task under some assumptions. Extensive experiments on eight datasets show that GSAT outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by up to 20%$\\uparrow$ in interpretation AUC and 5%$\\uparrow$ in prediction accuracy.

GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention mechanism*\n\n*Takeru Miyato, Bernhard Jaeger, Max Welling, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work argues that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure, and proposes a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.\n\n**Abstract:** As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks. However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable. We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure. Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometry-aware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs. By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 213  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 7. Implicit Memory Transformer for Computationally Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implicit attention*\n\n*Matthew Raffel, Lizhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of theart approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Abstract:** Simultaneous speech translation is an essential communication task difficult for humans whereby a translation is generated concurrently with oncoming speech inputs. For such a streaming task, transformers using block processing to break an input sequence into segments have achieved state-of-the-art performance at a reduced cost. Current methods to allow information to propagate across segments, including left context and memory banks, have faltered as they are both insufficient representations and unnecessarily expensive to compute. In this paper, we propose an Implicit Memory Transformer that implicitly retains memory through a new left context method, removing the need to explicitly represent memory with memory banks. We generate the left context from the attention output of the previous segment and include it in the keys and values of the current segment's attention calculation. Experiments on the MuST-C dataset show that the Implicit Memory Transformer provides a substantial speedup on the encoder forward pass with nearly identical translation quality when compared with the state-of-the-art approach that employs both left context and memory banks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implicit attention*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 9. Efficient and Modular Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implicit attention*\n\n*Mathieu Blondel, Quentin Berthet, Marco Cuturi, Roy Frostig, Stephan Hoyer, Felipe Llinares-L'opez, Fabian Pedregosa, Jean-Philippe Vert*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems, and shows that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily.\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 192  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Attention as a Hypernetwork\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention mechanism*\n\n*Razvan Pascanu, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Yassir Akram, Seijin Kobayashi, Simon Schug*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers can under some circumstances generalize to novel problem instances whose constituent parts might have been encountered during training but whose compositions have not. What mechanisms underlie this ability for compositional generalization? By reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork, we reveal that a composable, low-dimensional latent code specifies key-query specific operations. We find empirically that this latent code is predictive of the subtasks the network performs on unseen task compositions revealing that latent codes acquired during training are reused to solve unseen problem instances. To further examine the hypothesis that the intrinsic hypernetwork of multi-head attention supports compositional generalization, we ablate whether making the hypernetwork generated linear value network nonlinear strengthens compositionality. We find that this modification improves compositional generalization on abstract reasoning tasks. In particular, we introduce a symbolic version of the Raven Progressive Matrices human intelligence test which gives us precise control over the problem compositions encountered during training and evaluation. We demonstrate on this task how scaling model size and data enables compositional generalization in transformers and gives rise to a functionally structured latent space.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention mechanism*\n\n*Christopher Pal, Amine Elhattami, Jonathan Pilault*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

EdgeNeXt: Efficiently Amalgamated CNN-Transformer Architecture for Mobile Vision Applications\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implicit attention*\n\n*Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Rao Muhammad Anwer, Syed Waqas Zamir, Salman Khan, Hisham Cholakkal, Abdelrahman Shaker, Muhammad Maaz*\n\n**Abstract:** In the pursuit of achieving ever-increasing accuracy, large and complex neural networks are usually developed. Such models demand high computational resources and therefore cannot be deployed on edge devices. It is of great interest to build resource-efficient general purpose networks due to their usefulness in several application areas. In this work, we strive to effectively combine the strengths of both CNN and Transformer models and propose a new efficient hybrid architecture EdgeNeXt. Specifically in EdgeNeXt, we introduce split depth-wise transpose attention (STDA) encoder that splits input tensors into multiple channel groups and utilizes depth-wise convolution along with self-attention across channel dimensions to implicitly increase the receptive field and encode multi-scale features. Our extensive experiments on classification, detection and segmentation tasks, reveal the merits of the proposed approach, outperforming state-of-the-art methods with comparatively lower compute requirements. Our EdgeNeXt model with 1.3M parameters achieves 71.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K, outperforming MobileViT with an absolute gain of 2.2% with 28% reduction in FLOPs. Further, our EdgeNeXt model with 5.6M parameters achieves 79.4% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. The code and models are available at https://t.ly/_Vu9.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Towards Accurate Scene Text Recognition with Semantic Reasoning Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient implicit attention*\n\n*Errui Ding, Junyu Han, Deli Yu, Jingtuo Liu, Chengquan Zhang, Xuan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Scene text image contains two levels of contents: visual texture and semantic information. Although the previous scene text recognition methods have made great progress over the past few years, the research on mining semantic information to assist text recognition attracts less attention, only RNN-like structures are explored to implicitly model semantic information. However, we observe that RNN based methods have some obvious shortcomings, such as time-dependent decoding manner and one-way serial transmission of semantic context, which greatly limit the help of semantic information and the computation efficiency. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel end-to-end trainable framework named semantic reasoning network (SRN) for accurate scene text recognition, where a global semantic reasoning module (GSRM) is introduced to capture global semantic context through multi-way parallel transmission. The state-of-the-art results on 7 public benchmarks, including regular text, irregular text and non-Latin long text, verify the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. In addition, the speed of SRN has significant advantages over the RNN based methods, demonstrating its value in practical use.\n\n**Conference:** towards-accurate-scene-text-recognition-with-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates advanced techniques such as hypernetwork transformers, efficient state-space attention mechanisms, and adaptive implicit neural functions, here are some key points and recommendations based on the provided analysis and references:\n\n### Hypernetwork Transformers\n\n- **Dynamic Attention Weights**: The references on HyperPrompt and HyperGrid Transformers are crucial.

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Denis Xavier Charles, Eren Manavoglu, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2022)\t**Cited by** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SPADE augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods and demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.91)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer architectures are now central in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017). They rely on the attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015) to contextualize the input. The context can\n\n[^0]be seen as a random access memory whose size linearly grows with the sequence length; each query reads from it using a softmax-normalized linear combination, with overhead linear in the memory size. This amounts to a quadratic complexity overall, making transformers' computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. One way to improve attention's efficiency is to bound its memory size. Imposing a constantsized constraint over the memory ensures that reading from it has constant time and space overhead, yielding a linear overall complexity in sequence lengths. This is in fact a common strategy adopted by several recent works. In this work, we show that some of these works are closely connected in ways that, to date, have gone unremarked. We propose attention with bounded-memory control $(\\mathrm{ABC})$, a unified abstraction over them. In ABC , constant-sized memories are organized with various control strategies, e.g., induced from heuristic patterns (Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020; Rae et al., 2020, inter alia), locality assumptions (Parmar et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018), or positions (Wang et al., 2020b). These strategies, by and large, are \"contextagnostic.\" In response to this, we propose $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$, a particular instance of $A B C$ that learns a contextualized control strategy from data. Specifically, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ uses a neural network to determine how to store each token into the memory (if at all). Compared to previous bounded-memory models, it strikes a better trade-off between accuracy and efficiency: controlling for the accuracy, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with much smaller memory sizes. ABC models (including $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ ) come with a linear complexity in sequence lengths, and admit recurrent computation graphs in causal attention (self-attention over the prefix). Therefore they are appealing choices in a variety of applications, including text encoding, language modeling and text generation. This leads to a surprising finding. Lin-\nformer (Wang et al., 2020b), an established efficient attention method, was previously thought not to be applicable in causal attention or autoregressive decoding (Tay et al., 2020). Through the ABC view, we show that it actually is, and achieves competitive performance in our machine translation experiments. ABC connects existing models that would otherwise seem distinct, reveals new insights into established methods, and inspires new efficient attention architectures. We explore its applications in transformers, as a drop-in substitute for the canonical softmax attention. ABC offers a novel lens that can help future research in the analysis of transformers, where the theoretical insights are still catching up with empirical success. Experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ model outperforms previous $A B C$ approaches in accuracy with a much smaller memory size. Compared to the strong transformer baseline, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ achieves a significant speedup and memory savings at inference time, with no or negligible accuracy loss. The efficiency improvements are more prominent for long sequences, suggesting that the asymptotic savings are even more appealing in applications involving long sequences. We release our code at https://github.com/Noahs-ARK/ABC. ## 2 An Outer-Product View of Attention\n\nThis section presents our outer-product memory perspective of attention, which allows for a smooth transition to later discussion. In attention, a sequence of queries $\\left\\{\\mathbf{q}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ attend to a memory with $N$ slots, each storing a key and value pair: $\\mathbf{K}=\\left[\\mathbf{k}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_{N}\\right]^{\\top}, \\mathbf{V}=$ $\\left[\\mathbf{v}_{1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{v}_{N}\\right]^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$. ${ }^{1}$ Query $\\mathbf{q}$ reads from the memory using a softmax-normalized linear combination, producing a $d$-dimensional vector:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{attn}\\left(\\mathbf{q},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{i}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=\\mathbf{V}^{\\top} \\text { softmax }(\\mathbf{K q})\n$$\n\nThis takes $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time and space. When the attention with $N$ queries can be parallelized (e.g., in text encoding), it takes linear time and quadratic space; when it cannot be (e.g., in decoding), it takes quadratic time and linear space. The memory can be equivalently represented as sums of vector outer products: $\\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{I K}=$\n\n[^1]$\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{e}_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i}, \\mathbf{V}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\mathbf{e}_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{i} . \\mathbf{I}$ is the identity matrix, and $\\otimes$ denotes the outer product: $[\\mathbf{x} \\otimes$ $\\mathbf{y}]_{i, j}=x_{i} y_{j} . N$-dimensional vectors $\\left\\{\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\right\\}$ form the standard basis: $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$ has the $i$ th element being one and others zeros. We can view $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$ as control vectors that determine where to store $\\mathbf{k}_{i}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ :\n\\[\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{e}_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i} & =[\\underbrace{0, \\ldots 0}_{i-1}, 1, \\underbrace{0, \\ldots, 0}_{N-i}]^{\\top} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i} \\\\\n& =[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{0}}_{d \\times(i-1)} ; \\mathbf{k}_{i} ; \\underbrace{\\mathbf{0}}_{d \\times(N-i)}]^{\\top} . \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\\]\n\nThe $N$-by- $d$ matrix on the last line has its $i$ th row being $\\mathbf{k}_{i}^{\\top}$ and all others zeros; in this sense, $\\mathbf{k}_{i}$ is stored in the $i$ th slot by $\\mathbf{e}_{i}$, not affecting others. ## 3 Attention with Bounded Memory\n\nA straightforward way to improve attention's efficiency is to bound its memory size. Our outerproduct view of attention provides a straightforward way to devise this, by replacing $\\left\\{\\mathbf{e}_{i}\\right\\}$ with control vectors that select $n \\ll N$ vectors to attend to. We dub this approach attention with bounded-memory control (ABC). Concretely, let $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}, \\widetilde{\\mathbf{V}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ denote a constant-size memory with $n$ slots, with $n$ set a priori. $$\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i}, \\quad \\widetilde{\\mathbf{V}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\phi_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{i}\n$$\n\n$\\left\\{\\phi_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ denotes a sequence of control vectors. The output is calculated by attending to $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{V}}: \\operatorname{ABC}\\left(\\mathbf{q},\\left\\{\\mathbf{k}_{i}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\mathbf{v}_{i}\\right\\},\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}\\right\\}\\right)=$\n\n$$\n\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}^{\\top} \\operatorname{softmax}(\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}} \\mathbf{q})\n$$\n\nWe will discuss various ways to construct $\\left\\{\\phi_{i}\\right\\}$ in the subsequent sections. Reading from the memory takes a constant $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time and space; therefore ABC's overall complexity is $\\mathcal{O}(N n)$, linear in the sequence length. ${ }^{2}$\n\nEq. 3 offers an equivalent recurrent computation, which is particularly useful in causal attention where only the prefix is looked at,\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t+1}=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}+\\phi_{t+1} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{t+1}\n$$\n\nlikewise for $\\tilde{\\mathbf{V}}_{t} . \\quad \\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}$ and $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{V}}_{t}$ can be seen as the recurrent hidden state that encodes the prefix. In what follows, we study several existing efficient attention approaches and show that they are in fact instances of the $A B C$ abstraction. [^2]\n### 3.1 Linformer\n\nLinformer (Wang et al., 2020b) is an established efficient transformer variant that has proven successful in masked language modeling and text encoding. It assumes fixed-length inputs and learns a low-rank approximation of the attention weights. A learned $n$-by- $N$ matrix $\\mathbf{W}^{\\mathrm{LF}}$ down projects the $N$-by- $d$ dimensional keys and values along the timestep dimension, to an $n$-by- $d$ memory: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}^{\\mathrm{LF}}=\\mathbf{W}^{\\mathrm{LF}} \\mathbf{K}$, $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{V}}^{\\mathrm{LF}}=\\mathbf{W}^{\\mathrm{LF}} \\mathbf{V}$; they are then used for attention computation with Eq. 4. This yields a linear complexity in the input length. Linformer is an ABC instance with $\\phi_{i}^{\\mathrm{LF}}=\\mathbf{W}_{:, i}^{\\mathrm{LF}}$ ( $i$ th column), and in this sense, it learns a control vector for each position. Previous works have noted that Linformer cannot be efficiently applied in causal attention (Table 1 of Tay et al., 2020). Indeed, it is less straightforward to avoid mixing future with the past when projecting along the timestep dimension. ABC reveals that, in fact, Linformer is applicable in causal attention. Like all ABC models, it admits a linear-complexity recurrent computation (Eq. 5): $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{LF}}=\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}+\\phi_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{LF}} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{t+1}$. This confirms ABC's benefits: it reveals new insights about existing models and reassesses their applications and impact. Our experiments show that Linformer achieves competitive performance in machine translation. ### 3.2 Clustering-Based Attention\n\nImproving attention's efficiency with clustering has received an increasing amount of interest (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020a, inter alia). ABC bears interesting connections to clustering-based methods. Here we discuss an approach that closely follows Vyas et al. (2020), except that it clusters keys and values instead of queries, and only attends to the centroids to reduce the effective context size. Formally, keys and values are grouped into $n<N$ clusters $\\left\\{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{n}$, $\\left\\{\\widetilde{\\mathbf{v}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}}\\right\\}_{j=1}^{n}{ }^{3}$ Let an $N$-by- $n$ binary matrix M denote the cluster membership shared between keys and values. $M_{i, j}=1 \\mathrm{iff.} \\mathbf{k}_{i}$ is assigned to cluster $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}}$ and $\\mathbf{v}_{i}$ to $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{v}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}}$. The $j$ th centroid for the keys is\n\n$$\n\\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}}=\\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{M_{i, j}}{\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} M_{\\ell, j}} \\mathbf{k}_{i}\n$$\n\n[^3]likewise for the values. It then attends over the centroids using Eq. 4, with $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}^{\\mathrm{CL}}=\\left[\\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{1}^{\\mathrm{CL}}, \\ldots, \\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{n}^{\\mathrm{CL}}\\right]^{\\top}=$\n\\[\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbf{e}_{j} \\otimes \\widetilde{\\mathbf{k}}_{j}^{\\mathrm{CL}} & =\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbf{e}_{j} \\otimes \\sum_{i=1}^{N} \\frac{M_{i, j}}{\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} M_{\\ell, j}} \\mathbf{k}_{i} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{i=1}^{N}\\left(\\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\mathbf{e}_{j} \\frac{M_{i, j}}{\\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} M_{\\ell, j}}\\right) \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\\]\n\nThe last line indicates that this model is an instance of ABC: $\\phi_{i}=\\sum_{j=1}^{n}\\left(M_{i, j} / \\sum_{\\ell=1}^{N} M_{\\ell, j}\\right) \\mathbf{e}_{j}$. The stack of centroids can be seen as the constant-size memory. Putting aside the clustering overhead (i.e., constructing M and computing centroids), it has a linear complexity in the sequence length. ### 3.3 Sliding-Window Attention\n\nIn some applications, being able to remove entries from the memory can be beneficial: clearing up older context frees slots for more recent ones, promoting a locality inductive bias. ABC offers the capability to do so, if augmented with an additional matrix multiplication. We use the sliding-window attention as an example. Attending to the most recent $n$ input tokens (Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Sukhbaatar et al., 2021, inter alia) can be seen as a firstin-first-out queue that \"pops\" out the oldest token while \"pushing\" in the most recent one: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{WD}}=\\left[\\mathbf{k}_{t-n+1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_{t}\\right]^{\\top}$. The pop operation can be achieved by multiplying an $n$-by- $n$ upper shift matrix: $U_{i, j}=\\delta_{i+1, j}$, with $\\delta$ being the Kronecker delta (i.e., U has ones only on the superdiagonal and zeros elsewhere). Left-multiplying $\\mathbf{U}$ against $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{WD}}$ shifts its rows one position up, with zeros appearing in the last:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{U} \\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{WD}} & =\\mathbf{U}[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{k}_{t-n+1}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_{t}}_{n}]^{\\top} \\\\\n& =[\\underbrace{\\mathbf{k}_{t-n+2}, \\ldots, \\mathbf{k}_{t-1}, \\mathbf{k}_{t}}_{n-1}, \\mathbf{0}]^{\\top} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} . \\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThen the most recent token can be put into the slot freed up: $\\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t+1}^{\\mathrm{WD}}=\\mathbf{U} \\widetilde{\\mathbf{K}}_{t}^{\\mathrm{WD}}+\\mathbf{e}_{n} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{t+1} . \\mathbf{U}$ and $\\phi_{t}=\\mathbf{e}_{n}$ ensure a first-in-first-out queue. Dilated and stride convolution patterns (Beltagy et al., 2020) can be similarly recovered (\u00a7A.4). Recurrently multiplying $\\mathbf{U}$ simulates the discrete pop operation (Grefenstette et al., 2015; Joulin and Mikolov, 2015; Yogatama et al., 2018) in a differentiable way. This is reminiscent of recurrent neural networks, while in this case $\\mathbf{U}$ is never updated as\nparameters. It is exciting to explore learning $\\mathbf{U}$, but is beyond the scope of this work. Discussion. Besides the models discussed above, certain variants of Rae et al. (2020) and sparse attention patterns (local-to-global attention; Beltagy et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Ainslie et al., 2020) can also be seen as instances of ABC (\u00a7A). ABC provides a unified perspective of them, and at the same time points out their limitations: their control strategies are context-agnostic. In response to this, in $\\S 4$ we propose to learn a contextualized strategy from data. Table 1 analyzes various ABC models, and Table 2 details their complexity. ## 4 Learned Memory Control\n\nThe ABC abstraction connects several existing approaches that would otherwise seem distinct. This inspires the design of new architectures. We hypothesize that learning a contextualized strategy can achieve better performance. This section introduces $A_{B C M L P}$. It parameterizes $\\phi$ with a singlelayer multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that takes as input the token's representation $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$, and determines which slots to write it into and how much. $$\n\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{i}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{W}_{\\boldsymbol{\\phi}} \\mathbf{x}_{i}\\right), \\quad \\boldsymbol{\\phi}_{i}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{i} / \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{j}\n$$\n\nMatrix $\\mathbf{W}_{\\phi}$ is learned. $\\exp$ is an elementwise activation function. The motivation is to allow for storing a \"fractional\" (but never negative) amount of input into the memory. ${ }^{4}$ Using a non-negative activation, however, has a drawback: the scales of $\\sum_{i} \\phi_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{k}_{i}$ and $\\sum_{i} \\phi_{i} \\otimes \\mathbf{v}_{i}$ would grow with the sequence lengths, making training less stable. To overcome this, we divide $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{i}$ vectors by their sum. This functions as normalization and aims to offset the impact of varying sequence lengths. ${ }^{5}$ It admits the recurrent computation graph as in Eq. 5, and has a linear complexity in the sequence length. A key design choice of $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ is that its $\\phi_{i}$ depends only on current input $\\mathbf{x}_{i}$. This helps (1) keep the recurrent computation efficient in practice (Lei et al., 2018), and (2) make it applicable\n\n[^4]in not only encoder self-attention and cross attention, but also causal attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of developing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and most useful information gathered from the analysis:\n\n### Key Components and Ideas\n\n1. **Hypernetwork Attention Mechanisms:**\n   - The idea of reformulating multi-head attention as a hypernetwork is crucial.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nGalanti, T. and Wolf, L.

Score: 0.24)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/23 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1334-1345, 2018.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork architecture sparse computation*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork architecture sparse computation*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Long-range Sequence Modeling with Predictable Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork architecture sparse computation*\n\n*Yimeng Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Mei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling, which remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been shown to be an effective approach for capturing global context dependencies in sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic complexity in time and memory usage. Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Fully Sparse 3D Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork architecture sparse computation*\n\n*Lue Fan, Feng Wang, Nai-long Wang, Zhaoxiang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A fully sparse 3D object detector (FSD) is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module and achieves state-of-the-art performance on a large perception range and is 2.4 times faster than its dense counterpart.\n\n**Abstract:** As the perception range of LiDAR increases, LiDAR-based 3D object detection becomes a dominant task in the long-range perception task of autonomous driving. The mainstream 3D object detectors usually build dense feature maps in the network backbone and prediction head. However, the computational and spatial costs on the dense feature map are quadratic to the perception range, which makes them hardly scale up to the long-range setting. To enable efficient long-range LiDAR-based object detection, we build a fully sparse 3D object detector (FSD). The computational and spatial cost of FSD is roughly linear to the number of points and independent of the perception range. FSD is built upon the general sparse voxel encoder and a novel sparse instance recognition (SIR) module. SIR first groups the points into instances and then applies instance-wise feature extraction and prediction. In this way, SIR resolves the issue of center feature missing, which hinders the design of the fully sparse architecture for all center-based or anchor-based detectors. Moreover, SIR avoids the time-consuming neighbor queries in previous point-based methods by grouping points into instances. We conduct extensive experiments on the large-scale Waymo Open Dataset to reveal the working mechanism of FSD, and state-of-the-art performance is reported. To demonstrate the superiority of FSD in long-range detection, we also conduct experiments on Argoverse 2 Dataset, which has a much larger perception range ($200m$) than Waymo Open Dataset ($75m$). On such a large perception range, FSD achieves state-of-the-art performance and is 2.4$\\times$ faster than the dense counterpart.

Sparse DETR: Efficient End-to-End Object Detection with Learnable Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork architecture sparse computation*\n\n*Byungseok Roh, Jaewoong Shin, Wuhyun Shin, Saehoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparse DETR is proposed that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder to help the model effectively detect objects and achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** DETR is the first end-to-end object detector using a transformer encoder-decoder architecture and demonstrates competitive performance but low computational efficiency on high resolution feature maps. The subsequent work, Deformable DETR, enhances the efficiency of DETR by replacing dense attention with deformable attention, which achieves 10x faster convergence and improved performance. Deformable DETR uses the multiscale feature to ameliorate performance, however, the number of encoder tokens increases by 20x compared to DETR, and the computation cost of the encoder attention remains a bottleneck. In our preliminary experiment, we observe that the detection performance hardly deteriorates even if only a part of the encoder token is updated. Inspired by this observation, we propose Sparse DETR that selectively updates only the tokens expected to be referenced by the decoder, thus help the model effectively detect objects. In addition, we show that applying an auxiliary detection loss on the selected tokens in the encoder improves the performance while minimizing computational overhead. We validate that Sparse DETR achieves better performance than Deformable DETR even with only 10% encoder tokens on the COCO dataset. Albeit only the encoder tokens are sparsified, the total computation cost decreases by 38% and the frames per second (FPS) increases by 42% compared to Deformable DETR.

This architecture uses a hypernetwork to generate domain-specific parameters, which can be particularly useful for adapting language models to different domains.\n\n- Another relevant work is the \"Decoder-Only Random Hypernetworks\" architecture, which involves a trainable latent code vector and fixed random projection decoder weights. This approach can be efficient for parameter generation and could be adapted for language models.\n\n## Integration of Sparse Computation with Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- The concept of integrating sparse computation with hypernetworks is hinted at in the analysis note, which mentions the potential of combining sparse computation with hypernetworks for efficient parameter generation. While the provided sources do not explicitly detail this integration, the idea of using sparse computation to reduce the computational and memory footprint is a common theme in efficient neural network design. For example, techniques like selective context compression and balanced memory utilization can be combined with sparse hypernetworks to achieve better efficiency.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Architectures for State Management\n\n- The \"BPipe\" architecture employs memory-balanced pipeline parallelism, which ensures that all GPUs utilize comparable amounts of memory during training. This approach can be crucial for managing the state in large language models efficiently.\n\n- The \"Compressing Context to Enhance Inference Efficiency\" paper discusses selective context compression, which significantly reduces memory cost and generation latency. This technique can be applied to manage the state in autoregressive language models more efficiently.\n\n## Comparison of Different Hypernetwork Designs\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly compare different hypernetwork designs, the \"Hypernetwork-Assisted Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\" paper and the \"Decoder-Only Random Hypernetworks\" paper present different approaches to hypernetwork architecture. Comparing these architectures in terms of their parameter generation efficiency, memory usage, and adaptability to different tasks could provide valuable insights.\n\n## Implementation Details of Sparse Computation in Neural Networks\n\n- The \"SmoothQuant\" paper discusses post-training quantization methods that smooth activation outliers by migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights. This approach can be adapted to implement sparse computation in neural networks, reducing the memory footprint and improving efficiency.\n\n- The \"OmniQuant\" paper introduces learnable weight clipping and other quantization techniques that can be integrated with sparse computation to maintain accuracy while reducing the memory footprint of neural networks.\n\nBy exploring these sources and integrating the concepts of hypernetworks, sparse computation, and memory-efficient architectures, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models. The key insights from the analysis note, such as selective context compression, balanced memory utilization, and efficient post-training quantization, will be crucial in achieving these goals.\n",

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nGalanti, T. and Wolf, L.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Learning to Jointly Share and Prune Weights for Grounding Based Vision and Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Burak Uzkent, Yilin Shen, Heng Huang, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers and proposes to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been successful in processing different data modalities, such as language and image data, which could use transformers with similar architectures to achieve good performance. Leveraging this observation, we propose weight sharing across two transformer backbones and within the same transformer backbone and pruning across two backbones in a unified framework. More specifically, we investigate weight sharing and pruning for two components of the transformers: (1) Multi-Head Attention (MSA) and (2) Feed-Forward Network (FFN) layers. To jointly perform weight sharing and pruning, we propose to use a regularization term to align model weights and the desired structure during the multimodal pre-training step. The structure vectors of sharing and pruning are generated by using a hypernetwork, which can capture complex interactions between pruning and sharing across layers and modalities. We train the hypernetwork and model weights iteratively so that the learned structure evolves along with model weights. After minimizing the proposed objective in pre-training step, we perform weight sharing and pruning and fine-tune the compressed model on downstream tasks. Finally, we perform experiments on vision and language tasks, including Referring Expression Comprehension (REC), Visual Question Answering (VQA), and Object Detection using the state-of-the-art grounding based models: MDETR and GLIP. Our experiments show that we can compress these models by 35\u2212 40% by sharing and pruning MSA and FFN weights without almost any loss in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. HyperPELT: Unified Parameter-Efficient Language Model Tuning for Both Language and Vision-and-Language Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Zhengkun Zhang, Wenya Guo, Xiaojun Meng, Yasheng Wang, Yadao Wang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Zhenglu Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper designs a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks and adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The workflow of pretraining and fine-tuning has emerged as a popular paradigm for solving various NLP and V&L (Vision-and-Language) downstream tasks. With the capacity of pretrained models growing rapidly, how to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become fairly important for quick transfer learning and deployment. In this paper, we design a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks. In particular, we use a shared hypernetwork that takes trainable hyper-embeddings as input, and outputs weights for fine-tuning different small modules in a pretrained language model, such as tuning the parameters inserted into multi-head attention blocks (i.e., prefix-tuning) and feed-forward blocks (i.e., adapter-tuning). We define a set of embeddings (e.g., layer, block, task and visual embeddings) as the key components to calculate hyper-embeddings, which thus can support both pure language and V&L tasks. Our proposed framework adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results on the GLUE benchmark and multiple V&L tasks confirm the effectiveness of our framework on both textual and visual modalities.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

Chi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers, which can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt-Tuning is a new paradigm for finetuning pre-trained language models in a parameter-efficient way. Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks. We show that HyperPrompt is competitive against strong multi-task learning baselines with as few as $0.14\\%$ of additional task-conditioning parameters, achieving great parameter and computational efficiency. Through extensive empirical experiments, we demonstrate that HyperPrompt can achieve superior performances over strong T5 multi-task learning baselines and parameter-efficient adapter variants including Prompt-Tuning and HyperFormer++ on Natural Language Understanding benchmarks of GLUE and SuperGLUE across many model sizes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4. Transferring from Formal Newswire Domain with Hypernet for Twitter POS Tagging\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Jingjing Gong, Minlong Peng, Di Liang, Keyu Ding, Xuanjing Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hypernetwork-based method to generate different parameters to separately model contexts with different expression styles for POS tagging for Twitter, and shows that this approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in most cases.\n\n**Abstract:** Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging for Twitter has received considerable attention in recent years. Because most POS tagging methods are based on supervised models, they usually require a large amount of labeled data for training. However, the existing labeled datasets for Twitter are much smaller than those for newswire text. Hence, to help POS tagging for Twitter, most domain adaptation methods try to leverage newswire datasets by learning the shared features between the two domains. However, from a linguistic perspective, Twitter users not only tend to mimic the formal expressions of traditional media, like news, but they also appear to be developing linguistically informal styles. Therefore, POS tagging for the formal Twitter context can be learned together with the newswire dataset, while POS tagging for the informal Twitter context should be learned separately. To achieve this task, in this work, we propose a hypernetwork-based method to generate different parameters to separately model contexts with different expression styles. Experimental results on three different datasets show that our approach achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods in most cases.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Christopher Pal, Amine Elhattami, Jonathan Pilault*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) networks have emerged as a promising method for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, MTL must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Often, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), a separate model per task is needed to obtain the best performance. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, i.e., potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel Transformer architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task-conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction (a hypernetwork adapter), we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach, we are able to surpass single task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient (using around 66% of the data for weight updates). Compared to other BERT Large methods on GLUE, our 8-task model surpasses other Adapter methods by 2.8% and our 24-task model outperforms by 0.7-1.0% models that use MTL and single task fine-tuning. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.

Investigating the Effectiveness of HyperTuning via Gisting\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Jason Phang*\n\n**Abstract:** Gisting (Mu et al., 2023) is a simple method for training models to compress information into fewer token representations using a modified attention mask, and can serve as an economical approach to training Transformer-based hypernetworks. We introduce HyperLlama, a set of Gisting-based hypernetworks built on Llama-2 models that generates task-specific soft prefixes based on few-shot inputs. In experiments across P3, Super-NaturalInstructions and Symbol Tuning datasets, we show that HyperLlama models can effectively compress information from few-shot examples into soft prefixes. However, they still underperform multi-task fine-tuned language models with full attention over few-shot in-context examples. We also show that HyperLlama-generated soft prefixes can serve as better initializations for further prefix tuning. Overall, Gisting-based hypernetworks are economical and easy to implement, but have mixed empirical performance.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. FedTP: Federated Learning by Transformer Personalization\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork attention language-models*\n\n*Ye Shi, Chin-Teng Lin, Weiping Ding, Jiangnan Tang, Jingya Wang, Zhongyi Cai, Hongxia Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning is an emerging learning paradigm where multiple clients collaboratively train a machine learning model in a privacy-preserving manner. Personalized federated learning extends this paradigm to overcome heterogeneity across clients by learning personalized models. Recently, there have been some initial attempts to apply Transformers to federated learning. However, the impacts of federated learning algorithms on self-attention have not yet been studied. This paper investigates this relationship and reveals that federated averaging algorithms actually have a negative impact on self-attention where there is data heterogeneity. These impacts limit the capabilities of the Transformer model in federated learning settings. Based on this, we propose FedTP, a novel Transformer-based federated learning framework that learns personalized self-attention for each client while aggregating the other parameters among the clients. Instead of using a vanilla personalization mechanism that maintains personalized self-attention layers of each client locally, we develop a learn-to-personalize mechanism to further encourage the cooperation among clients and to increase the scablability and generalization of FedTP. Specifically, the learn-to-personalize is realized by learning a hypernetwork on the server that outputs the personalized projection matrices of self-attention layers to generate client-wise queries, keys and values. Furthermore, we present the generalization bound for FedTP with the learn-to-personalize mechanism. Notably, FedTP offers a convenient environment for performing a range of image and language tasks using the same federated network architecture - all of which benefit from Transformer personalization. Extensive experiments verify that FedTP with the learn-to-personalize mechanism yields state-of-the-art performance in non-IID scenarios.

For instance, the idea of \"attention as a hypernetwork\" suggests reformulating attention layers within Transformer models using hypernetworks. This approach can enhance adaptability and efficiency by generating task-specific attention weights dynamically.\n- In the context of language models, hypernetworks can be used to generate adaptive weights for attention layers, allowing the model to capture task-specific patterns and improve performance on various tasks.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation in Language Models\n\n- Hypernetworks are particularly useful for dynamic parameter generation. They can learn to generate model parameters based on the input data or task context, which is beneficial for fine-tuning large pre-trained models. This approach is seen in methods like HyperDet, where a hypernetwork generates LoRA weights for different tasks, and in REACT, where a hypernetwork generates adaptive weights for various distributions.\n\n## Computational Efficiency of Hypernetwork-Based Approaches\n\n- Hypernetwork-based approaches are often more computationally efficient than traditional fine-tuning methods. For example, the use of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in conjunction with hypernetworks can reduce the number of parameters that need to be updated, thereby preserving pre-trained knowledge while improving computational efficiency and inference speed.\n- The REACT framework demonstrates that using a hypernetwork to generate adaptive weights can reduce fine-tuning efforts and improve performance with fewer iterations and samples, which is crucial for efficiency.\n\n## Applications of Hypernetworks in Meta-Learning\n\n- Hypernetworks are highly relevant in meta-learning contexts. They enable the model to learn across multiple tasks by generating task-specific parameters. The REACT framework, for instance, uses a hypernetwork to meta-learn the model on a diverse set of tasks, enhancing generalizability and adaptability.\n- This approach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the model needs to adapt quickly to new tasks or data distributions with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n## Comparison with Traditional Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Traditional attention mechanisms in Transformer models can be improved by incorporating probabilistic approaches, such as the Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism (GPAM). However, hypernetworks offer a different perspective by dynamically generating attention weights, which can be more flexible and adaptive to different tasks and contexts.\n- The comparison between traditional attention mechanisms and hypernetwork-based attention mechanisms suggests that the latter can provide better adaptability and efficiency, especially in scenarios where the model needs to handle diverse tasks or data distributions.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs) and Hypernetworks**: While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of SSMs with hypernetworks, the concept of using hypernetworks to generate adaptive parameters can complement SSMs by providing dynamic and task-specific adjustments to the state space models.\n- **Sparse Modular Activation**: This technique can further enhance the efficiency of hypernetwork-based models by selectively activating certain components, reducing computational costs and improving model expressiveness. However, the provided sources do not directly address this integration, suggesting a need for further research in this area.\n\nIn summary, hypernetworks offer a promising approach for improving autoregressive language models by enabling dynamic parameter generation, enhancing computational efficiency, and facilitating meta-learning across multiple tasks. Integrating hypernetworks with attention mechanisms and potentially with SSMs and sparse activation techniques could lead to more adaptable, efficient, and scalable language models.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary.

We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Continuous-time identification of dynamic state-space models by deep subspace encoding\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*G. Beintema, M. Schoukens, R. T'oth*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and it is shown that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Abstract:** Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 270  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 5.

Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** A state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 333  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Generalizing to New Physical Systems via Context-Informed Dynamics Model\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*Yuan Yin, Patrick Gallinari, Alain Rakotomamonjy, Nicolas Baskiotis, J\u00e9r\u00e9mie Don\u00e0, Matthieu Kirchmeyer*\n\n**Abstract:** Data-driven approaches to modeling physical systems fail to generalize to unseen systems that share the same general dynamics with the learning domain, but correspond to different physical contexts. We propose a new framework for this key problem, context-informed dynamics adaptation (CoDA), which takes into account the distributional shift across systems for fast and efficient adaptation to new dynamics. CoDA leverages multiple environments, each associated to a different dynamic, and learns to condition the dynamics model on contextual parameters, specific to each environment. The conditioning is performed via a hypernetwork, learned jointly with a context vector from observed data. The proposed formulation constrains the search hypothesis space to foster fast adaptation and better generalization across environments. We theoretically motivate our approach and show state-of-the-art generalization results on a set of nonlinear dynamics, representative of a variety of application domains. We also show, on these systems, that new system parameters can be inferred from context vectors with minimal supervision.

Universal Morphology Control via Contextual Modulation\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*Shimon Whiteson, Jacob Beck, Zheng Xiong*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly improve learning efficiency and generalization in continuous control. However, it poses a challenging multi-task reinforcement learning problem, as the optimal policy may be quite different across robots and critically depend on the morphology. Existing methods utilize graph neural networks or transformers to handle heterogeneous state and action spaces across different morphologies, but pay little attention to the dependency of a robot's control policy on its morphology context. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical architecture to better model this dependency via contextual modulation, which includes two key submodules: (1) Instead of enforcing hard parameter sharing across robots, we use hypernetworks to generate morphology-dependent control parameters; (2) We propose a fixed attention mechanism that solely depends on the morphology to modulate the interactions between different limbs in a robot. Experimental results show that our method not only improves learning performance on a diverse set of training robots, but also generalizes better to unseen morphologies in a zero-shot fashion.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. ColdNAS: Search to Modulate for User Cold-Start Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models hypernetwork efficiency*\n\n*Quanming Yao, Dejing Dou, daxiang dong, Qinghe Jing, Yaqing Wang, Shiguang Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Making personalized recommendation for cold-start users, who only have a few interaction histories, is a challenging problem in recommendation systems. Recent works leverage hypernetworks to directly map user interaction histories to user-specific parameters, which are then used to modulate predictor by feature-wise linear modulation function. These works obtain the state-of-the-art performance. However, the physical meaning of scaling and shifting in recommendation data is unclear. Instead of using a fixed modulation function and deciding modulation position by expertise, we propose a modulation framework called ColdNAS for user cold-start problem, where we look for proper modulation structure, including function and position, via neural architecture search. We design a search space which covers broad models and theoretically prove that this search space can be transformed to a much smaller space, enabling an efficient and robust one-shot search algorithm. Extensive experimental results on benchmark datasets show that ColdNAS consistently performs the best. We observe that different modulation functions lead to the best performance on different datasets, which validates the necessity of designing a searching-based method.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on the integration of state-space models (SSMs) with hypernetworks, memory optimization, sparse computation, and performance analysis of hybrid architectures, here are some relevant findings and suggestions:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models with Hypernetworks\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of SSMs with hypernetworks in the context of language models, the concept of using hypernetworks for dynamic parameter generation can be extended. For instance, hypernetworks can be used to generate parameters for SSMs, allowing for adaptive and task-specific modeling. This idea is supported by the use of hypernetworks in other domains, such as generating policies in robotic tasks, where they encode demonstration trajectories into a latent space and decode them into policies using a hypernetwork.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Language Models\n\n- **Parameter Sharing and Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Hypernetworks can be used to share parameters efficiently among different modules of a language model, reducing memory requirements. For example, HyperPELT uses a shared hypernetwork to output weights for fine-tuning different small modules in a pretrained language model, which is memory-efficient Analysis Note.\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Efficient attention mechanisms like linear attention can significantly reduce computational and memory costs compared to conventional softmax attention. This is highlighted in the Lightning Attention-2 paper, which offers insights into handling unlimited sequence lengths efficiently Analysis Note.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Sparse Computation\n\n- **Sparse Activation Mechanisms**: While the sources provided do not specifically address sparse activation mechanisms in the context of hypernetworks, the general idea of sparse computation can be applied. For instance, techniques like weight pruning and sparse attention can be integrated into hypernetwork-based models to enhance efficiency. A paper on \"Enhancing In-Context Learning Performance with just SVD-Based Weight Pruning\" suggests theoretical perspectives on weight pruning, which could be adapted for sparse computation in hypernetworks.\n\n## Comparison of Different Memory Management Strategies\n\n- **Dynamic Adaptation and Parameter Generation**: Hypernetworks allow for dynamic adaptation by generating task-specific parameters, which can be more memory-efficient than storing multiple pre-trained models. This is demonstrated in the HyperPrompt and HyperPELT papers, where hypernetworks enable flexible information sharing and parameter-efficient fine-tuning Analysis Note.\n- **Comparison with Other Models**: Comparing memory management strategies between hypernetwork-based models and other architectures (like transformers with linear attention) can provide insights into the most efficient approaches. For example, the Lightning Attention-2 paper provides a comparison of memory and computational efficiency between different attention mechanisms Analysis Note.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Hybrid Architectures Combining SSMs and Attention\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: While there is no direct discussion on combining SSMs with attention mechanisms in the provided sources, the concept can be explored by integrating SSMs with hypernetwork-generated parameters and attention mechanisms. This hybrid approach could leverage the strengths of both SSMs (for modeling complex dynamics) and attention mechanisms (for efficient and focused processing).\n- **Conditional Diffusion Models**: The use of conditional diffusion models, which can generate high-quality parameters conditioned on specific tasks, might also be integrated with SSMs and attention mechanisms. This could enhance the performance and adaptability of the model, as seen in the application of diffusion models in other contexts.\n\nTo further investigate these areas, it would be beneficial to search for papers and research specifically focusing on:\n- Theoretical and empirical analyses of integrating SSMs with hypernetworks.\n- Advanced memory optimization techniques in language models, including sparse computation and efficient attention mechanisms.\n- Comparative studies on memory management strategies in different architectures.\n- Performance analyses of hybrid models combining SSMs, hypernetworks, and attention mechanisms.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.58)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/43 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 5484-5495, 2021.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Vinyals, Jakob Uszkoreit, Lukasz Kaiser*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2018)\t**Cited by** 673  (*Influential: 65*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses issues of parallelizability and global receptive field, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) sequentially process data by updating their state with each new data point, and have long been the de facto choice for sequence modeling tasks. However, their inherently sequential computation makes them slow to train. Feed-forward and convolutional architectures have recently been shown to achieve superior results on some sequence modeling tasks such as machine translation, with the added advantage that they concurrently process all inputs in the sequence, leading to easy parallelization and faster training times. Despite these successes, however, popular feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer fail to generalize in many simple tasks that recurrent models handle with ease, e.g. copying strings or even simple logical inference when the string or formula lengths exceed those observed at training time. We propose the Universal Transformer (UT), a parallel-in-time self-attentive recurrent sequence model which can be cast as a generalization of the Transformer model and which addresses these issues. UTs combine the parallelizability and global receptive field of feed-forward sequence models like the Transformer with the recurrent inductive bias of RNNs. We also add a dynamic per-position halting mechanism and find that it improves accuracy on several tasks. In contrast to the standard Transformer, under certain assumptions, UTs can be shown to be Turing-complete. Our experiments show that UTs outperform standard Transformers on a wide range of algorithmic and language understanding tasks, including the challenging LAMBADA language modeling task where UTs achieve a new state of the art, and machine translation where UTs achieve a 0.9 BLEU improvement over Transformers on the WMT14 En-De dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/32 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1610.02357, 2016.

Compressing Context to Enhance Inference Efficiency of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Yucheng Li, Bo Dong, Chenghua Lin, Frank Guerin*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that Selective Context significantly reduces memory cost and decreases generation latency while maintaining comparable performance compared to that achieved when full context is used, indicating that it strikes a good balance between efficiency and performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) achieved remarkable performance across various tasks. However, they face challenges in managing long documents and extended conversations, due to significantly increased computational requirements, both in memory and inference time, and potential context truncation when the input exceeds the LLM's fixed context length. This paper proposes a method called Selective Context that enhances the inference efficiency of LLMs by identifying and pruning redundancy in the input context to make the input more compact. We test our approach using common data sources requiring long context processing: arXiv papers, news articles, and long conversations, on tasks of summarisation, question answering, and response generation. Experimental results show that Selective Context significantly reduces memory cost and decreases generation latency while maintaining comparable performance compared to that achieved when full context is used. Specifically, we achieve a 50\\% reduction in context cost, resulting in a 36\\% reduction in inference memory usage and a 32\\% reduction in inference time, while observing only a minor drop of .023 in BERTscore and .038 in faithfulness on four downstream applications, indicating that our method strikes a good balance between efficiency and performance.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. OmniQuant: Omnidirectionally Calibrated Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Peng Xu, Lirui Zhao, Zhiqiang Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Y. Qiao, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization technique for LLMs is introduced, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (\\textbf{OmniQuant}) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

BPipe: Memory-Balanced Pipeline Parallelism for Training Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Taebum Kim, Hyoungjoon Kim, Gyeong-In Yu, Byung-Gon Chun*\n\n**TL;DR:** BP IPE employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between GPUs during training, enabling all GPUs to utilize comparable amounts of memory, and enhances the training ef\ufb01ciency of large language models like GPT-3 by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size.\n\n**Abstract:** Pipeline parallelism is a key technique for training large language models within GPU clusters. However, it often leads to a memory imbalance problem, where certain GPUs face high memory pressure while others underutilize their capacity. This imbalance results in suboptimal training performance, even when the overall GPU memory capacity is suf\ufb01cient for more ef\ufb01cient setups. To address this inef\ufb01ciency, we propose BP IPE , a novel approach for achieving memory balance in pipeline parallelism. BP IPE employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between GPUs during training, enabling all GPUs to utilize comparable amounts of memory. With balanced memory utilization, BP IPE enhances the training ef\ufb01ciency of large language models like GPT-3 by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size. Our evaluation conducted on 48 A100 GPUs across six nodes interconnected with HDR In\ufb01niBand shows that BP IPE accelerates the training of GPT-3 96B and GPT-3 134B models by 1.25x-2.17x compared to Megatron-LM, a state-of-the-art framework for training large language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. SmoothQuant: Accurate and Efficient Post-Training Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Ji Lin, Mickael Seznec, Julien Demouth, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs, offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) show excellent performance but are compute- and memory-intensive. Quantization can reduce memory and accelerate inference. However, existing methods cannot maintain accuracy and hardware efficiency at the same time. We propose SmoothQuant, a training-free, accuracy-preserving, and general-purpose post-training quantization (PTQ) solution to enable 8-bit weight, 8-bit activation (W8A8) quantization for LLMs. Based on the fact that weights are easy to quantize while activations are not, SmoothQuant smooths the activation outliers by offline migrating the quantization difficulty from activations to weights with a mathematically equivalent transformation. SmoothQuant enables an INT8 quantization of both weights and activations for all the matrix multiplications in LLMs, including OPT, BLOOM, GLM, MT-NLG, Llama-1/2, Falcon, Mistral, and Mixtral models. We demonstrate up to 1.56x speedup and 2x memory reduction for LLMs with negligible loss in accuracy. SmoothQuant enables serving 530B LLM within a single node. Our work offers a turn-key solution that reduces hardware costs and democratizes LLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/smoothquant.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 493  (*Influential: 81*)\n\n#### 5. Boosting Inference Efficiency: Unleashing the Power of Parameter-Shared Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Weize Chen, Xiaoyue Xu, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Ruobing Xie, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs and proposes a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration.\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-shared pre-trained language models (PLMs) have emerged as a successful approach in resource-constrained environments, enabling substantial reductions in model storage and memory costs without significant performance compromise. However, it is important to note that parameter sharing does not alleviate computational burdens associated with inference, thus impeding its practicality in situations characterized by limited stringent latency requirements or computational resources. Building upon neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we introduce a straightforward technique to enhance the inference efficiency of parameter-shared PLMs. Additionally, we propose a simple pre-training technique that leads to fully or partially shared models capable of achieving even greater inference acceleration. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods on both autoregressive and autoencoding PLMs, providing novel insights into more efficient utilization of parameter-shared models in resource-constrained settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Jie Fu, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Boris Knyazev, Xinyu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-25\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Efficient Pareto Set Approximation via Mixture of Experts Based Model Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language models memory-efficiency*\n\n*Bo Du, Han Hu, Shiwei Liu, Yong Luo, Li Shen, Anke Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Solving multi-objective optimization problems for large deep neural networks is a challenging task due to the complexity of the loss landscape and the expensive computational cost of training and evaluating models. Efficient Pareto front approximation of large models enables multi-objective optimization for various tasks such as multi-task learning and trade-off analysis. Existing algorithms for learning Pareto set, including (1) evolutionary, hypernetworks, and hypervolume-maximization methods, are computationally expensive and have restricted scalability to large models; (2) Scalarization algorithms, where a separate model is trained for each objective ray, which is inefficient for learning the entire Pareto set and fails to capture the objective trade-offs effectively. Inspired by the recent success of model merging, we propose a practical and scalable approach to Pareto set learning problem via mixture of experts (MoE) based model fusion. By ensembling the weights of specialized single-task models, the MoE module can effectively capture the trade-offs between multiple objectives and closely approximate the entire Pareto set of large neural networks. Once the routers are learned and a preference vector is set, the MoE module can be unloaded, thus no additional computational cost is introduced during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on vision and language tasks using large-scale models such as CLIP-ViT and GPT-2. The experimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently approximates the entire Pareto front of large models. Using only hundreds of trainable parameters of the MoE routers, our method even has lower memory usage compared to linear scalarization and algorithms that learn a single Pareto optimal solution, and are scalable to both the number of objectives and the size of the model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hypernetwork implementations, memory-efficient parameter generation, dynamic adaptation mechanisms, integration of sparse computation, and efficient state management, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hypernetwork Implementations in Language Models\n- The use of hypernetworks in language models is highlighted in the REACT framework, which involves residual-adaptive contextual tuning. This framework uses a hypernetwork to generate adaptive weights for the target network, enabling efficient fine-tuning and adaptation to new tasks without extensive retraining. The hypernetwork incorporates contextual information to handle varying distributions, which is crucial for dynamic adaptation.\n- Another example is the HyperAT framework, which combines hypernetworks with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) for adversarial robustness. Here, a hypernetwork generates method-specific and layer-specific LoRA module parameters, facilitating knowledge transfer between different adversarial training methods and reducing the number of trainable parameters.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Parameter Generation Techniques\n- The HyperAT framework is particularly relevant here, as it uses hypernetworks to generate LoRA module parameters. This approach is highly memory-efficient because it avoids the need for a large number of trainable parameters, instead relying on a lightweight hypernetwork to generate the necessary weights.\n- The REACT framework also employs hypernetworks to generate adaptive weights, which reduces the fine-tuning efforts and the number of parameters that need to be updated, making it more memory-efficient.\n\n## Dynamic Adaptation Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n- Both REACT and HyperAT frameworks incorporate dynamic adaptation mechanisms. In REACT, the hypernetwork generates adaptive weights based on the support set and contextual information, allowing the model to adapt to new tasks and distributions dynamically.\n- HyperAT enables the model to learn multiple adversarial training methods simultaneously through a shared hypernetwork, which acts as a general robustness information capturer across different methods. This facilitates dynamic adaptation to various adversarial scenarios.\n\n## Integration of Sparse Computation with Hypernetworks\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss the integration of sparse computation with hypernetworks, the concept of using hypernetworks to generate weights for specific layers or tasks can be extended to incorporate sparse computation strategies. For instance, hypernetworks could generate sparse weight matrices or adapt the sparsity patterns based on the task or input data, potentially enhancing efficiency.\n\n## Efficient State Management in Language Models\n- The analysis note mentions the importance of structured state representations in state space models (SSMs) for reducing memory requirements. Integrating hypernetworks with SSMs could enhance this efficiency by dynamically generating parameters based on the input state, thus optimizing memory usage[Analysis Note].\n- The use of hypernetworks in generating adaptive weights can also be seen as a form of efficient state management, as it allows the model to adapt to new tasks without requiring significant changes to the underlying state representations.\n\nIn summary, the REACT and HyperAT frameworks provide valuable insights into how hypernetworks can be used to improve the efficiency, adaptability, and robustness of language models. These approaches align well with the goals of improving autoregressive language model design by leveraging dynamic adaptation, memory-efficient parameter generation, and efficient state management.\n",

Implementing Sparse Modular Activation\n\n- **Architecture**:\n\n  - Introduce a gating mechanism that allows selective activation of sub-modules within the MetaLearner.\n\n  - The gate \\( g \\) is computed based on the input:\n\n    \\[\n    g = \\sigma(W_g x + b_g)\n    \\]\n\n    where \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function.\n\n- **Selective Activation**:\n\n  - The output is computed as:\n\n    \\[\n    y = g \\odot F_{\\text{active}}(x) + (1 - g) \\odot F_{\\text{inactive}}(x)\n    \\]\n\n    where \\( F_{\\text{active}} \\) and \\( F_{\\text{inactive}} \\) are the active and inactive sub-modules.\n\n- **Benefits**:\n\n  - Reduces computational and memory usage by skipping non-activated sub-modules.\n\n  - Adjusts computational resources based on input complexity.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-Code for HyperMetaLearner\n\n#### Hypernetwork-Based MetaLearner\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\n\nclass HyperMetaLearner(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, hyper_hidden_dim: int = None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        hyper_hidden_dim = hyper_hidden_dim or embed_dim // 2\n\n        # Hypernetwork generating parameters for the main network\n        self.hypernetwork = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, hyper_hidden_dim),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(hyper_hidden_dim, embed_dim * 2)  # For scale and shift\n        )\n\n        # Main network components\n        self.norm = nn.LayerNorm(embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.activation = nn.SiLU()\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # Generate parameters dynamically\n        params = self.hypernetwork(X)  # Shape: (B, L, D * 2)\n        scale, shift = params.chunk(2, dim=-1)\n        scale = torch.sigmoid(scale)  # Ensure scale is positive\n\n        # Normalize input\n        X_norm = self.norm(X)\n\n        # Apply dynamic scaling and shifting\n        Y = scale * X_norm + shift\n\n        # Activation\n        Y = self.activation(Y)\n\n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n#### Incorporating SSM within the MetaLearner\n\n```python\nclass SSMModule(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, input_dim: int, state_dim: int):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.A = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(state_dim, state_dim))\n        self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(state_dim, input_dim))\n        self.C = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_dim, state_dim))\n        self.D = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(input_dim, input_dim))\n\n    def forward(self, x):\n        seq_len = x.size(1)\n        h = torch.zeros(x.size(0), self.A.size(0), device=x.device)\n\n        outputs = []\n        for t in range(seq_len):\n            h = F.linear(h, self.A) + F.linear(x[:, t], self.B)\n            y_t = F.linear(h, self.C) + F.linear(x[:, t], self.D)\n            outputs.append(y_t.unsqueeze(1))\n\n        return torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)\n```\n\n#### Integrate SSM into HyperMetaLearner\n\nModify the `_forward` method:\n\n```python\ndef _forward(self, X, **Z):\n    # Generate parameters dynamically\n    params = self.hypernetwork(X)\n    scale, shift = params.chunk(2, dim=-1)\n    scale = torch.sigmoid(scale)\n\n    # Normalize input\n    X_norm = self.norm(X)\n\n    # Apply dynamic scaling and shifting\n    Y = scale * X_norm + shift\n\n    # Apply SSM module\n    ssm = SSMModule(input_dim=Y.size(-1), state_dim=Y.size(-1))\n    Y = ssm(Y)\n\n    # Activation\n    Y = self.activation(Y)\n\n    return Y, Z\n```\n\n#### Implementing Sparse Modular Activation\n\nIncorporate gating mechanism in the HyperMetaLearner:\n\n```python\ndef __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n             device=None, dtype=None, hyper_hidden_dim: int = None, **kwargs):\n    super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n    # [Same as before]\n    # Gating layer for Sparse Modular Activation\n    self.gate_layer = nn.Linear(embed_dim, 1)\n\ndef _forward(self, X, **Z):\n    # Generate parameters dynamically\n    params = self.hypernetwork(X)\n    scale, shift = params.chunk(2, dim=-1)\n    scale = torch.sigmoid(scale)\n\n    # Compute gating\n    gate = torch.sigmoid(self.gate_layer(X))  # Shape: (B, L, 1)\n\n    # Normalize input\n    X_norm = self.norm(X)\n\n    # Apply dynamic scaling and shifting\n    Y_active = scale * X_norm + shift\n\n    # Inactive path (could be zeros or a bypass)\n    Y_inactive = X_norm  # Or torch.zeros_like(X_norm)\n\n    # Combine based on gate\n    Y = gate * Y_active + (1 - gate) * Y_inactive\n\n    # Apply SSM module\n    ssm = SSMModule(input_dim=Y.size(-1), state_dim=Y.size(-1))\n    Y = ssm(Y)\n\n    # Activation\n    Y = self.activation(Y)\n\n    return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Integration Steps\n\n1. **Replace MetaLearner**: Substitute the existing MetaLearner GAU with the **HyperMetaLearner** in the model.\n\n2. **Initialize Hypernetwork**: Ensure the hypernetwork is properly initialized to prevent training instability.\n\n3. **Integrate SSM Module**: Incorporate the `SSMModule` into the HyperMetaLearner, ensuring compatibility with input dimensions.\n\n4. **Add Gating Mechanism**: Implement the gating mechanism for sparse activation, initializing the gate layer accordingly.\n\n5. **Training Considerations**:\n\n   - Use appropriate regularization techniques to prevent overfitting.\n\n   - Monitor training for stability issues due to the increased complexity.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe **HyperMetaLearner** enhances the MetaLearner GAU by integrating hypernetworks to dynamically generate attention weights, efficient state-space models to handle long-range dependencies, and sparse modular activation to improve efficiency. This design aims to improve adaptability, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models, enabling better performance on downstream tasks and efficient handling of long sequences.\n\n## References\n\n1.
