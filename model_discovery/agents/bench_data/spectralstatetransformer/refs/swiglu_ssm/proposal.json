Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4. Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 19 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"S4 layer Transformers\", \"State Space Models Transformers\", \"MLP improvements\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

To perform temporally extended and consistent simulations of the future in partially observable environments, world models need to possess long-term memory. However, state-of-the-art MBRL agents, such as Dreamer, predominantly employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as their world model backbone, which have limited memory capacity. In this paper, we seek to explore alternative world model backbones for improving long-term memory. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Transformers and Structured State Space Sequence (S4) models, motivated by their remarkable ability to capture long-range dependencies in low-dimensional sequences and their complementary strengths. We propose S4WM, the first S4-based world model that can generate high-dimensional image sequences through latent imagination. Furthermore, we extensively compare RNN-, Transformer-, and S4-based world models across four sets of environments, which we have specifically tailored to assess crucial memory capabilities of world models, including long-term imagination, context-dependent recall, reward prediction, and memory-based reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that S4WM outperforms Transformer-based world models in terms of long-term memory, while exhibiting greater efficiency during training and imagination.

This is primarily due to the interpretation of the softmax function as an approximation of the hardmax function. By clarifying the connection between the softmax function and the Boltzmann operator, we prove that a single layer of self-attention with low-rank weight matrices possesses the capability to perfectly capture the context of an entire input sequence. As a consequence, we show that one-layer and single-head Transformers have a memorization capacity for finite samples, and that Transformers consisting of one self-attention layer with two feed-forward neural networks are universal approximators for continuous permutation equivariant functions on a compact domain.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models Transformers\"*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

We propose a novel way to deal with the rare and unseen words for the neural network models using attention. Our model uses two softmax layers in order to predict the next word in conditional language models: one predicts the location of a word in the source sentence, and the other predicts a word in the shortlist vocabulary. At each time-step, the decision of which softmax layer to use choose adaptively made by an MLP which is conditioned on the context.~We motivate our work from a psychological evidence that humans naturally have a tendency to point towards objects in the context or the environment when the name of an object is not known.~We observe improvements on two tasks, neural machine translation on the Europarl English to French parallel corpora and text summarization on the Gigaword dataset using our proposed model.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 521  (*Influential: 52*)\n\n#### 6. Improving Self-Supervised Learning by Characterizing Idealized Representations\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP improvements\"*\n\n*Yann Dubois, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Stefano Ermon, Percy Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work characterize properties that SSL representations should ideally satisfy and proves necessary and sufficient conditions such that for any task invariant to given data augmentations, desired probes trained on that representation attain perfect accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the empirical successes of self-supervised learning (SSL) methods, it is unclear what characteristics of their representations lead to high downstream accuracies. In this work, we characterize properties that SSL representations should ideally satisfy. Specifically, we prove necessary and sufficient conditions such that for any task invariant to given data augmentations, desired probes (e.g., linear or MLP) trained on that representation attain perfect accuracy. These requirements lead to a unifying conceptual framework for improving existing SSL methods and deriving new ones. For contrastive learning, our framework prescribes simple but significant improvements to previous methods such as using asymmetric projection heads. For non-contrastive learning, we use our framework to derive a simple and novel objective. Our resulting SSL algorithms outperform baselines on standard benchmarks, including SwAV+multicrops on linear probing of ImageNet.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Exploring the Limits of Large Scale Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP improvements\"*\n\n*Samira Abnar, Mostafa Dehghani, Behnam Neyshabur, Hanie Sedghi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model for downstream performance is proposed that reflects the saturation phenomena and captures the nonlinear relationship in performance of upstream and downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent developments in large-scale machine learning suggest that by scaling up data, model size and training time properly, one might observe that improvements in pre-training would transfer favorably to most downstream tasks. In this work, we systematically study this phenomena and establish that, as we increase the upstream accuracy, the performance of downstream tasks saturates. In particular, we investigate more than 4800 experiments on Vision Transformers, MLP-Mixers and ResNets with number of parameters ranging from ten million to ten billion, trained on the largest scale of available image data (JFT, ImageNet21K) and evaluated on more than 20 downstream image recognition tasks. We propose a model for downstream performance that reflects the saturation phenomena and captures the nonlinear relationship in performance of upstream and downstream tasks. Delving deeper to understand the reasons that give rise to these phenomena, we show that the saturation behavior we observe is closely related to the way that representations evolve through the layers of the models. We showcase an even more extreme scenario where performance on upstream and downstream are at odds with each other. That is, to have a better downstream performance, we need to hurt upstream accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

In this work we focus\non autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and\nArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the\neffectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated\nState Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the\ndiagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several\nwell-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to\nlonger inputs while being straightforward to implement.

Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models\n  Requires Data-Driven Priors\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 layer Transformers\"*\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in\nmachine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that\ndramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these\nimpressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks\n(e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to\npredict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that\nrandom initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between\narchitectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using\n$\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across\nmultiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state\nspace models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla\nTransformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly\npretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256\ntask by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of\npreviously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become\nmostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through\npretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on\nsupervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is\nessential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-04T17:17:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-28T13:52:55Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models Transformers\"*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Orhan Firat, Christopher Pal, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nmodeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing\nto their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer\n(BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range\ncontextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term\nrepresentation of sequences. We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the\nBlock-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the\nlayer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model\nparallelization is employed.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-15T22:48:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-30T15:44:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Probabilistic Topic Modelling with Transformer Representations\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models Transformers\"*\n\n*Arik Reuter, Anton Thielmann, Christoph Weisser, Benjamin S\u00e4fken, Thomas Kneib*\n\n**Abstract:** Topic modelling was mostly dominated by Bayesian graphical models during the\nlast decade. With the rise of transformers in Natural Language Processing,\nhowever, several successful models that rely on straightforward clustering\napproaches in transformer-based embedding spaces have emerged and consolidated\nthe notion of topics as clusters of embedding vectors. We propose the\nTransformer-Representation Neural Topic Model (TNTM), which combines the\nbenefits of topic representations in transformer-based embedding spaces and\nprobabilistic modelling. Therefore, this approach unifies the powerful and\nversatile notion of topics based on transformer embeddings with fully\nprobabilistic modelling, as in models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We utilize the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for improved\ninference speed and modelling flexibility.

Model-tuning Via Prompts Makes NLP Models Adversarially Robust\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP improvements\"*\n\n*Mrigank Raman, Pratyush Maini, J. Zico Kolter, Zachary C. Lipton, Danish Pruthi*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, NLP practitioners have converged on the following practice:\n(i) import an off-the-shelf pretrained (masked) language model; (ii) append a\nmultilayer perceptron atop the CLS token's hidden representation (with randomly\ninitialized weights); and (iii) fine-tune the entire model on a downstream task\n(MLP-FT). This procedure has produced massive gains on standard NLP benchmarks,\nbut these models remain brittle, even to mild adversarial perturbations. In\nthis work, we demonstrate surprising gains in adversarial robustness enjoyed by\nModel-tuning Via Prompts (MVP), an alternative method of adapting to downstream\ntasks. Rather than appending an MLP head to make output prediction, MVP appends\na prompt template to the input, and makes prediction via text\ninfilling/completion. Across 5 NLP datasets, 4 adversarial attacks, and 3\ndifferent models, MVP improves performance against adversarial substitutions by\nan average of 8% over standard methods and even outperforms adversarial\ntraining-based state-of-art defenses by 3.5%. By combining MVP with adversarial\ntraining, we achieve further improvements in adversarial robustness while\nmaintaining performance on unperturbed examples. Finally, we conduct ablations\nto investigate the mechanism underlying these gains. Notably, we find that the\nmain causes of vulnerability of MLP-FT can be attributed to the misalignment\nbetween pre-training and fine-tuning tasks, and the randomly initialized MLP\nparameters.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-13T17:41:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-12-06T00:48:53Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Temporal Relation Extraction with a Graph-Based Deep Biaffine Attention\n  Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"MLP improvements\"*\n\n*Bo-Ying Su, Shang-Ling Hsu, Kuan-Yin Lai, Amarnath Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal information extraction plays a critical role in natural language\nunderstanding. Previous systems have incorporated advanced neural language\nmodels and have successfully enhanced the accuracy of temporal information\nextraction tasks. However, these systems have two major shortcomings. First,\nthey fail to make use of the two-sided nature of temporal relations in\nprediction. Second, they involve non-parallelizable pipelines in inference\nprocess that bring little performance gain. To this end, we propose a novel\ntemporal information extraction model based on deep biaffine attention to\nextract temporal relationships between events in unstructured text efficiently\nand accurately. Our model is performant because we perform relation extraction\ntasks directly instead of considering event annotation as a prerequisite of\nrelation extraction. Moreover, our architecture uses Multilayer Perceptrons\n(MLP) with biaffine attention to predict arcs and relation labels separately,\nimproving relation detecting accuracy by exploiting the two-sided nature of\ntemporal relationships. We experimentally demonstrate that our model achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance in temporal relation extraction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-16T19:40:08Z  (*Updated: 2022-01-16T19:40:08Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 layer Transformers\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Ankit Gupta, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. S4ND: Modeling Images and Videos as Multidimensional Signals Using State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 layer Transformers\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Stephen A. Baccus, Tri Dao, Preey Shah, Gordon W. Downs, Albert Gu, Karan Goel, Eric Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** Visual data such as images and videos are typically modeled as discretizations of inherently continuous, multidimensional signals. Existing continuous-signal models attempt to exploit this fact by modeling the underlying signals of visual (e.g., image) data directly. However, these models have not yet been able to achieve competitive performance on practical vision tasks such as large-scale image and video classification. Building on a recent line of work on deep state space models (SSMs), we propose S4ND, a new multidimensional SSM layer that extends the continuous-signal modeling ability of SSMs to multidimensional data including images and videos. We show that S4ND can model large-scale visual data in $1$D, $2$D, and $3$D as continuous multidimensional signals and demonstrates strong performance by simply swapping Conv2D and self-attention layers with S4ND layers in existing state-of-the-art models. On ImageNet-1k, S4ND exceeds the performance of a Vision Transformer baseline by $1.5\\%$ when training with a $1$D sequence of patches, and matches ConvNeXt when modeling images in $2$D. For videos, S4ND improves on an inflated $3$D ConvNeXt in activity classification on HMDB-51 by $4\\%$. S4ND implicitly learns global, continuous convolutional kernels that are resolution invariant by construction, providing an inductive bias that enables generalization across multiple resolutions. By developing a simple bandlimiting modification to S4 to overcome aliasing, S4ND achieves strong zero-shot (unseen at training time) resolution performance, outperforming a baseline Conv2D by $40\\%$ on CIFAR-10 when trained on $8 \\times 8$ and tested on $32 \\times 32$ images. When trained with progressive resizing, S4ND comes within $\\sim 1\\%$ of a high-resolution model while training $22\\%$ faster.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 3.

However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks.

MLP-based vision architectures with less inductive bias achieve competitive performance in image recognition compared with CNNs and vision Transformers. Among them, spatial-shift MLP (S$^2$-MLP), adopting the straightforward spatial-shift operation, achieves better performance than the pioneering works including MLP-mixer and ResMLP. More recently, using smaller patches with a pyramid structure, Vision Permutator (ViP) and Global Filter Network (GFNet) achieve better performance than S$^2$-MLP. In this paper, we improve the S$^2$-MLP vision backbone. We expand the feature map along the channel dimension and split the expanded feature map into several parts. We conduct different spatial-shift operations on split parts. Meanwhile, we exploit the split-attention operation to fuse these split parts. Moreover, like the counterparts, we adopt smaller-scale patches and use a pyramid structure for boosting the image recognition accuracy. We term the improved spatial-shift MLP vision backbone as S$^2$-MLPv2. Using 55M parameters, our medium-scale model, S$^2$-MLPv2-Medium achieves an $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet-1K benchmark using $224\\times 224$ images without self-attention and external training data.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-02\n\n\n\n#### 6.

However, the MRI quality can be easily degraded by various noise, which can greatly affect the accuracy of diagnosis of small lesion. Although some methods for denoising MR images have been proposed, task-specific denoising methods for improving the diagnosis confidence of small lesions are lacking. In this work, we propose a voxel-wise hybrid residual MLP-CNN model to denoise three-dimensional (3D) MR images with small lesions. We combine basic deep learning architecture, MLP and CNN, to obtain an appropriate inherent bias for the image denoising and integrate each output layers in MLP and CNN by adding residual connections to leverage long-range information. We evaluate the proposed method on 720 T2-FLAIR brain images with small lesions at different noise levels. The results show the superiority of our method in both quantitative and visual evaluations on testing dataset compared to state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, two experienced radiologists agreed that at moderate and high noise levels, our method outperforms other methods in terms of recovery of small lesions and overall image denoising quality.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 38/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nPeng, Goldstein, et al. 2024) by adopting the ideas of selectivity and state expansion. ## 11 Conclusion\n\nWe proposed a theoretical framework based on well-studied classes of structured matrices that bridges the conceptual gap between SSMs and attention variants. This framework yields insights on how recent SSMs (e.g. Mamba) perform as well as Transformers on language modeling. Moreover, our theoretical tools provide new ideas to improve SSMs (and potentially Transformers) by connecting the algorithmic and systems advances on both sides. As a demonstration, the framework guides our design of a new architecture (Mamba-2) at the intersection of SSMs and structured attention. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe thank Angela Wu for the suggestion on how to efficiently compute the gradient of $\\Delta$ in a numerically stable manner.

The Hidden Attention of Mamba Models.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.) This paper fleshes out the relationship between state space models and attention through the bridge of structured matrices.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the **SwiGluMLP** architecture by integrating **Structured State-Space Models (SSMs)**, particularly the **S4 layer**, to improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, enhance computational efficiency, and overall performance. Here are the key points and the most useful information that can help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integration of SSMs into MLP Layers\n\n- **DenseSSM**: The concept of integrating hidden states across layers in SSMs, as described in the DenseSSM paper, can be applied to enhance the information flow within the SwiGluMLP GAU. This approach retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output, which is beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies.\n\n## State Space Duality (SSD) Framework\n\n- The SSD framework by Tri Dao and Albert Gu establishes theoretical connections between SSMs and attention mechanisms in Transformers. This framework can guide the integration of SSMs into the SwiGluMLP architecture, leveraging the strengths of both models.\n\n## Simplification and Efficiency\n\n- **S4D Model**: The use of diagonal state space models like S4D can simplify the integration of SSMs into the SwiGluMLP GAU. S4D retains performance while reducing computational complexity, making it a practical choice.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated State Space (GSS) Layer**: Incorporating gating mechanisms from the GSS layer can enhance the selectivity and dynamic control over information flow within the SwiGluMLP GAU. This can improve training speed and overall performance.\n\n## Empirical Performance and Pretraining\n\n- The importance of data-driven initialization and pretraining is highlighted in several studies.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 3. State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Carmen Amo Alonso, Jerome Sieber, M. Zeilinger*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective is provided, and a comparative analysis of these models is presented, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear state-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation models. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars.

Zeilinger\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in integrating linear state-space models (SSM) in deep neural network architectures of foundation models. This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better performance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language tasks. Foundation models, like e.g. GPT-4, aim to encode sequential data into a latent space in order to learn a compressed representation of the data. The same goal has been pursued by control theorists using SSMs to efficiently model dynamical systems. Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence modeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the corresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction to SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest research developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful SSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic perspective. Additionally, we present a comparative analysis of these models, evaluating their performance on a standardized benchmark designed for assessing a model's efficiency at learning long sequences.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 213  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

With the rise of transformers in Natural Language Processing,\nhowever, several successful models that rely on straightforward clustering\napproaches in transformer-based embedding spaces have emerged and consolidated\nthe notion of topics as clusters of embedding vectors. We propose the\nTransformer-Representation Neural Topic Model (TNTM), which combines the\nbenefits of topic representations in transformer-based embedding spaces and\nprobabilistic modelling. Therefore, this approach unifies the powerful and\nversatile notion of topics based on transformer embeddings with fully\nprobabilistic modelling, as in models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We utilize the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for improved\ninference speed and modelling flexibility. Experimental results show that our\nproposed model achieves results on par with various state-of-the-art approaches\nin terms of embedding coherence while maintaining almost perfect topic\ndiversity.

Pretraining Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated SSM in MLP\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Jing Nathan Yan, Albert Gu, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. While other\narchitectures have been used, downstream accuracy is either significantly\nworse, or requires attention layers to match standard benchmarks such as GLUE.\nThis work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in\nsequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs). Our proposed model,\nBidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM layers with a multiplicative\ngating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling\narchitectures. The model learns static layers that do not consider pair-wise\ninteractions. Even so, BiGS is able to match BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE\nand can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without\napproximation. Analysis shows that while the models have similar average\naccuracy, the approach has different inductive biases than BERT in terms of\ninteractions and syntactic representations. All models from this work are\navailable at https://github.com/jxiw/BiGS.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-20T18:50:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-05-09T01:08:20Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space Models in Transformers\"*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated SSM in MLP\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. GLINT-RU: Gated Lightweight Intelligent Recurrent Units for Sequential Recommender Systems\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated SSM in MLP\"*\n\n*Xiangyu Zhao, Maolin Wang, Sheng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence, transformer-based models have gained significant attention in the context of Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs), demonstrating remarkable proficiency in capturing user-item interactions. However, such attention-based frameworks result in substantial computational overhead and extended inference time. To address this problem, this paper proposes a novel efficient sequential recommendation framework GLINT-RU that leverages dense selective Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) module to accelerate the inference speed, which is a pioneering work to further exploit the potential of efficient GRU modules in SRSs. The GRU module lies at the heart of GLINT-RU, playing a crucial role in substantially reducing both inference time and GPU memory usage. Through the integration of a dense selective gate, our framework adeptly captures both long-term and short-term item dependencies, enabling the adaptive generation of item scores. GLINT-RU further integrates a mixing block, enriching it with global user-item interaction information to bolster recommendation quality. Moreover, we design a gated Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) for our framework where the information is deeply filtered. Extensive experiments on three datasets are conducted to highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of GLINT-RU. Our GLINT-RU achieves exceptional inference speed and prediction accuracy, outperforming existing baselines based on Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Transformer, MLP and State Space Model (SSM). These results establish a new standard in sequential recommendation, highlighting the potential of GLINT-RU as a renewing approach in the realm of recommender systems.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate **Structured State-Space Models (SSMs)**, particularly the **S4 layer**, into the MLP components of Transformer-based architectures like SwiGluMLP, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided sources and additional context.\n\n## Integration of SSMs into MLP Layers\n\n### Feasibility and Architectural Compatibility\n- The S4 layer, a component of SSMs, can be integrated into existing neural network architectures with minimal changes.

Since BERT (Devlin et al., 2018), they have proven central to NLP tasks with their ability to learn effectively on large unlabeled datasets. Specifically, the use of attention as a central routing component seems to be critical to empirical success on downstream tasks. Other architectures have been proposed but require attention layers for high-accuracy (Tay et al., 2020b; Lee-Thorp et al., 2021). Is the centrality of attention in pretraining due to inductive bias or computational convenience? This question is complicated by the properties of common sequence routing layers: recurrent neural network (RNN) models due not scale as well as attention, whereas convolutional neural networks\n(CNNs) can not easily model long-distance dependencies. State-space models (SSMs) for deep learning provide a promising alternative. Recent works show that SSMs are a competitive architecture for long-range sequence modeling (Gu et al., 2021). SSMs achieve strong results on speech generation (Goel et al., 2022) and on the Long Range Arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020a) outperform standard and long-range transformer architectures (Gu et al., 2021; Gupta, 2022; Gu et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2022). In addition to improving accuracy, SSM-based routing does not have quadratic complexity as the length of the sequence grows. Concretely, the model provides a way to achieve RNN-like long-range dependencies with CNN-like training speed. This work proposes an architecture for applying SSMs using a Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS) model for BERT-style pretraining. BiGS uses SSMrouting at its core as a replacement for attention. However, this change alone significantly degrades the representational capacity of the model. To target this issue, we develop a multiplicative gating architecture (Dauphin et al., 2017; Hua et al., 2022; Mehta et al., 2022). In combination, this leads to a simpler routing approach that remains surprisingly effective at modeling necessary interactions. Experiments compare SSMs to standard NLP pretraining. While we find that SSMs by themselves underperform on NLP pretraining tasks, BiGS is able to match the performance of a BERT model when trained on the same data in a controlled setting. By additionally pretraining on longerlength instances, the model is able to grow without approximation to extend to input sequences of length 4,096 . Analysis shows that importance of multiplicative gating in fixing specific issues of variable-length textual input. All models from this work are available at https://github.com/ jxiw/BiGS. ## 2 Related Work\n\nPrior to BERT, promising pretraining approaches for learning contextual representations were learned using RNN-based models (McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018). While important precursors, their accuracy did not scale with data or compute as well as Transformers. This gap remains even when back-porting best-practices from Transformer pretraining (Peters et al., 2019). Recently Tay et al. (2021) explored pretraining with several convolutional (CNN) variants. Results show that CNN without attention does not perform well, although they note benefits in routing speed. Lee-Thorp et al. (2021) propose FNet which replaces the attention layer with a Fourier transform. Without attention, this achieves $92-97 \\%$ results on GLUE (Wang et al., 2018). Other works have used CNN-based models with multiplicative gating for NLP tasks such as machine translation (Dauphin et al., 2017). We believe BiGS is the first model to achieve BERT-level transfer learning on the GLUE benchmark without attention. Researchers have begun to use state-space models for NLP tasks, and have primarily focused on auto-regressive language modeling. In S 4 ( Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Gupta, 2022; Gu et al., 2022), researchers experimented with language modeling, achieving promising results, though slightly worse than transformers. Gated State Space adapts a SSM plus gating approach to language modeling (Mehta et al., 2022). Concurrent to this work, Dao et al. (2022) propose H3 which closes the gap in auto-regressive language modeling, and with two attention layers outperforms transformers on OpenWebText. Finally, a related method, MEGA (Ma et al., 2022) combines exponential moving average routing with a simple attention unit to outperform transformer baselines. Our approach instead focuses on bidirectional masked language modeling and questions of downstream generalization. ## 3 Background\n\n### 3.1 State Space Models\n\nA state space model (SSM) is a general-purpose tool for describing the relationship between a continuous-time scalar input $u(t)$ to scalar output $y(t)$ by the following differential equations:\n$x^{\\prime}(t)=\\boldsymbol{A} x(t)+\\boldsymbol{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\boldsymbol{C} x(t)+\\boldsymbol{D} u(t)$. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_06661db68d2188afac78g-02.jpg?height=353&width=689&top_left_y=246&top_left_x=1095)\n\nFigure 1: A SSM learns a one-dimensional kernel $\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}$, which is convolved with the input sequence $u$ to produce output $y$. Unlike attention, routing is static and does not depend on the input. In BiGS we use only two kernels per layer (forward and backward). Figure 3 shows all the kernels used in the fully trained model. Where $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a continuous-time state vector, $x^{\\prime}(t)$ is its derivative, and the equation is parameterized by $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}, \\boldsymbol{C} \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}, \\boldsymbol{D} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times 1}$. When applied to a discrete-time scalar input sequence $u_{1}, \\ldots u_{L}$, the SSM equations and parameters can be discretized, leading to the following recursion,\n\n$$\nx_{k}=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}} x_{k-1}+\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}} u_{k}, \\quad y_{k}=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{C}} x_{k}+\\overline{\\boldsymbol{D}} u_{k}\n$$\n\nWhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are functions of the original parameters and a discretization rate. This equation can be computed like an RNN where $x_{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is a hidden state at time $k$. Unlike an RNN though, the linearity of the recursion allows $y_{1} \\ldots y_{L}$ to be computed directly using a convolution with precomputed kernel $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}}=\\left(\\overline{\\boldsymbol{C B}}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{C A B}}, \\ldots, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{C A}}^{L-1} \\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}\\right) \\\\\n& y=\\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}} * u\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe process is illustrated in Figure 1. In a practical sense, after training, this kernel $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{K}}$ fully characterizes the SSM, i.e. the model is a 1 D convolution with a very long kernel. ### 3.2 Learning SSMs\n\nGu et al. $(2020,2021)$ demonstrate an effective approach for using SSMs in neural networks. The core insight is to propose a parameterization of the transition matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$, known as HiPPO,\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{A}_{n k}=- \\begin{cases}(2 n+1)^{1 / 2}(2 k+1)^{1 / 2} & \\text { if } n>k \\\\ n+1 & \\text { if } n=k \\\\ 0 & \\text { if } n<k\\end{cases}\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_06661db68d2188afac78g-03.jpg?height=912&width=1473&top_left_y=229&top_left_x=334)\n\nFigure 2: Model Variants. (STACK) is the standard transformer architecture, (GATED) is based on the gated unit (Mehta et al., 2022; Hua et al., 2022). For the Routing component (dashed lines), we consider both a bidirectional SSM (shown) and standard self-attention. The gate $(\\otimes)$ represents element-wise multiplication. The BiGS model uses GATED with SSM. This matrix yields a stable training regime that can also be efficiently trained. The full model, S4, retains the SSM ability to model long-term sequences while being more efficient than RNNs to train. Recently, researchers (Gu et al., 2022; Gupta, 2022) have proposed simplified diagonalized versions of S4, which achieve comparable results with a simpler approximation of the original parameterization. In preliminary experiments, we used several different S4 parameterizations but did not find a significant difference in accuracy. Throughout the work, we use S4D as the parameterization. While the specifics of SSM discretization, parameterizations, and training are beyond the scope of this work, at a high-level, we note that each of the models leads to the form in the previous section. The model can be therefore be trained by backpropagation though the convolution and discretization without the serial bottleneck of RNNs, and applied without the quadratic cost of attention. Each SSM itself has $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ parameters, and we use $N=64$ throughout the work. ### 3.3 Multiplicative Gating\n\nGating units have been widely used to improve the performance of various architectures such as MLP,\nCNN, and Transformers (Dauphin et al., 2017; Shazeer, 2020; Narang et al., 2021). One example of such a gating unit is the Gated Linear Unit (GLU) which has been used effectively for CNNbased NLP systems (Dauphin et al., 2017). Let u represent an input activation. GLU first computes both a gating vector and a linear transform, $\\sigma(\\mathbf{W u})$ and Vu respectively. The output of the layer is then the element-wise product $\\sigma(\\mathbf{W u}) \\otimes(\\mathbf{V u})$. Recent work has shown that gating can increase the performance of models using simplified routing. Hua et al. (2022) show that linear time attention models can benefit form improved gating. Mehta et al. (2022) propose a Gated State Space architecture using gating for unidirectional SSM models. Multiplicative gating may restore some of the interaction capacity from full attention-based interactions. ## 4 BiGS Model\n\nWe consider two different architectures for SSM pretraining: a stacked architecture (STACK) and a multiplicative gated architecture (GATED) shown in Figure 2. Transformer Architecture The STACK architecture with self-attention is equivalent to the BERT /\ntransformer model. We replace the attention block with two sequential SSM blocks to mimic the nature of bi-directional self-attention. Gated Architecture The GATED architecture is a bidirectional adaptation of the gated unit of Hua et al. (2022). Specifically, let $\\mathbf{X}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ be activations at the $i$-th layer where the length is $L$, and the model size is $d$. We use the activation GELU (Hendrycks and Gimpel, 2016) for $\\sigma$. The first stage computes,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mathbf{X}=\\text { LayerNorm }\\left(\\mathbf{X}_{i}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{V}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{v} \\mathbf{X}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times 3 d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{F}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{f} \\mathbf{X}\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{B}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{b} \\operatorname{Flip}(\\mathbf{X})\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe second stage uses 2 sequential blocks (i.e., a forward and backward SSM layer) with a multiplicative gate. $$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mathbf{U}_{1}=\\mathbf{W}_{u_{1}} \\operatorname{SSM}(\\mathbf{F}) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{U}_{2}=\\mathbf{W}_{u_{2}} \\operatorname{SSM}(\\mathbf{B}) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{U}=\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W}_{u}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{1} \\otimes \\operatorname{Flip}\\left(\\mathbf{U}_{2}\\right)\\right)\\right) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times 3 d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe third stage uses a feed-forward layer again with gating, to replace the two dense blocks in the traditional transformer architecture. We sum this output $\\mathbf{O}$ with the original input $\\mathbf{X}_{i}$ finally as the input $\\mathbf{X}_{i+1}$ of the next layer $i+1$. $$\n\\begin{array}{ll}\n\\mathbf{O}=\\mathbf{W}_{o}(\\mathbf{U} \\otimes \\mathbf{V}) & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\\\\n\\mathbf{X}_{i+1}=\\mathbf{O}+\\mathbf{X}_{i} & \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nThe number of parameters per layer in gated SSM is roughly $13 d^{2}$ while the number of parameters per layer in the stack is $12 d^{2}$. We compensate for this difference by using fewer gated layers. SSM Layer The SSM layer under both architectures is a map over vector sequences, $\\operatorname{SSM}(\\mathbf{X})$ : $\\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$. However SSMs are defined for scalar sequences. Past work, creates $d$ differently parameterized SSMs for each dimension ( Gu et al., 2021). Experimentally though, we found it just as effective to use the same parameterization (and therefore kernel $\\overline{\\mathbf{K}}$ ) for each hidden dimension. This simplifies model analysis and makes the total number of SSM parameters negligible. ## 5 Experimental Setup\n\nExperiments compare the performance of SSMbased models to attention-based models on several standard fine-tuning benchmarks. Experiments control for total parameter-size and amount of pretraining in terms of number of tokens. All models are on the order of magnitude of BERT-Large at around 350M parameters; all GATED SSM models use 23 layers and STACK models 24 to match parameter count. In order to run ablation tests, we consider three different pretraining scales: 11B (short), 29B (medium), and 97B (full). Models and architectures are roughly similar in training speed at this length. The 11B (short) training scale is roughly equivalent to the \"24h BERT\" setting typically used in research studies (Izsak et al., 2021). Full training is closer to the original BERT model which was trained on 128B tokens. For all pretraining, we follow the training data and masking strategy of Izsak et al. (2021). Following RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), we use only masked language modeling and not next-sentence prediction. We preprocess and mask tokens offline for all models for consistency, with maximal sequence length to be 128 .\n```\n\n#### 2.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/56 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis suggests that the training sequence length should be carefully chosen according to the intended downstream use of the model. ### 6.2. Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 4. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models based on Transformers have achieved remarkable success in various sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and speech recognition (Radford et al., 2023). The superior performance of Transformers is attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to aggregate the information from the input sequence. In contrast to its success, self-attention mechanism has a potential problem that it requires a large amount of computation and memory. To deal with this issue, many studies have been attempted to develop efficient models that can replace Transformers. Among them, Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered considerable interest recently. One advantage of SSMs is that the output can be computed with a significantly small time using convolution via FFT algorithm or recursive computation. Based on the original SSMs, many improvements have been proposed, such as HiPPO-based intialization (Gu et al. 2021) and architectures using gated convolutions (Fu et al. 2022, Poli et al., 2023). Networks based on SSMs have accomplished high performance in various applications such as gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2024), audio generation (Goel et al., 2022) and speech recognition (Saon et al. 2023). On the other hand, some of the recent studies pointed out the limitations of SSMs, especially for their abilities to solve tasks. For example, Merrill et al. (2024) show that SSMs cannot solve sequential problems from the view of computational complexity theory. Additionally, Gu and Dao (2023) pointed out that SSMs are less effective for the tasks to handle discrete and information-dense data such as language processing. Therefore, it is still unclear in what situation we can replace Transformers with SSMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5e098f2beaae0c90c478g-02.jpg?height=258&width=1373&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1.1: Conceptual illustrations of the abilities of SSMs. Left: This represents the classification task in which the existence of the token \" $A$ \" or \" $B$ \" is important. We prove that SSMs can extract such tokens, even if the position of the important token is different for each input. Right: This illustrate the task to predict the next token in the sequence. In this task, models have to output the token associated with the last token. We also prove that SSMs can solve such tasks, i.e., SSMs can extract appropriate tokens even if the position of essential tokens are different for each token in the same sequence. Recently, some studies have theoretically investigated the abilities of SSMs. For instance, Wang and Xue (2024) show that SSMs are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Additionally, Massaroli et al. (2024) constructed the parameters of SSMs to solve the task called associated recall. Moreover, Cirone et al. (2024) studied the abilities of SSMs using rough path theory. However, they mainly focus on the expressive power of SSMs and do not provide statistical understanding. Furthermore, quantitative evaluations to compare SSMs and Transformers is limited. Leaving aside SSMs, many studies have investigated the abilities of deep neural networks to estimate functions. Some of them analyze the estimation abilities of fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with the assumption that the target function is in certain function classes (Schmidt-Hieber, 2020, Suzuki, 2018) or have a specific smoothness structure (Suzuki and Nitanda, 2021). Moreover, Nakada and Imaizumi (2020) and Chen et al. (2022) consider the setting that the data distribution has a low-dimensional structure. Additionally, Okumoto and Suzuki (2021) studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and showed that CNNs can estimate the functions that have smoothness structures with the minimax optimal rate even if the input is infinite-dimensional. As for the Transformers, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate the functions with infinitedimensional input as well as CNNs. Additionally, they showed that Transformers can estimate the functions whose smoothness structure changes depending on the input. Our contributions. In this paper, we explore the abilities of SSMs with gated convolution to replace Transformers from the perspective of statistical learning theory. More specifically, we investigate the estimation ability of SSMs for the function classes called $\\gamma$-smooth and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth. For the function in these classes, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate them effectively. We prove that SSMs can also estimate those functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers, and show that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating those functions. The essential point of the two function classes above is that they have smoothness structures. As for $\\gamma$-smooth functions, the smoothness of the function is the same for all input sequences, i.e., the important features to extract are fixed. On the other hand, piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions have different smoothness depending on the input. This function class characterizes the ability of Transformers and SSMs to extract important features dynamically. In addition to the settings considered in Takakura and Suzuki (2023), we also consider the functions whose smoothness structure also changes depending on the position output token. This setting is inspired by the ability of Transformers to solve the task called associative recall (Ba et al. 2016). We show that SSMs can also replace Transformers in this setting. See Figure 1.1 for the conceptual illustrations of those function classes. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We theoretically investigate the estimation ability of SSMs with gated convolutions for $\\gamma$ smooth functions and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions. We show that SSMs can achieve the same estimation error as Transformers, which implies that SSMs may be alternative to Transformers in terms of estimating functions in those classes. 2. Inspired by recent research on the abilities of Transformers, we define function classes that are extensions of the piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth function class. Then, we prove that SSMs can also attain the similar estimation error for those classes. Other related works. The function classes with piecewise smoothness are also considered in Petersen and Voigtlaender (2018) and Imaizumi and Fukumizu (2019). They do not consider anisotropic smoothness or the sequence-to-sequence functions, while we consider such situations. One of the other directions to investigate the abilities of SSMs is to utilize the control theory, like Alonso et al. (2024). Instead of focusing on the statistical aspect, they mainly provide a comprehensive understanding of existing SSMs. Gu and DaO (2023) proposed an SSM-based architecture called Mamba, whose filter is controlled by the input. While convolution with FFT algorithms cannot be used for Mamba, they proposed a hardware-aware efficient implementation. In this paper, we do not focus on the setting that filters are controlled by the input, and we consider SSMs with gated convolution with data-independent filters.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to integrate **Structured State-Space Models (SSMs)**, particularly **Gated State Spaces (GSS)**, into the **SwiGluMLP** architecture to enhance long-range dependency modeling and computational efficiency. Here are the key points and most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Integration of SSMs into MLP Layers\n\n- **Feasibility and Efficiency**: Simplified SSMs like S4D and exponential smoothing-based models can be integrated into existing architectures with minimal computational overhead. This is supported by references such as \"Incorporating Exponential Smoothing into MLP: A Simple but Effective Sequence Model\" and \"On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\".\n\n### Gating Mechanisms for Dynamic Control\n\n- **Gated State Spaces (GSS)**: Incorporating gating mechanisms from GSS allows for dynamic control over information flow, enhancing long-range dependency modeling. This is highlighted in \"Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\"[5.1] and \"Pretraining Without Attention\" which introduces Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS).\n\n### Architectural Considerations\n\n- **Modifying the SwiGluMLP GAU**: Replace or augment the feedforward sublayers in SwiGluMLP with SSM-based layers that include gating. Ensure compatibility with existing components like normalization layers (e.g., RMSNorm)[Analysis Note, Section 3.3].\n- **State Augmentation and Hidden Connections**: Introduce state components into the MLP layer and use dense connections between layers to enhance information flow, as suggested in \"DenseSSM: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models\"[5.2].\n\n### Expected Benefits\n\n- **Improved Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: SSMs can capture extended context, essential for tasks requiring long-term dependencies. This is a key benefit of integrating SSMs, as noted in \"Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\"[5.1].\n- **Computational Efficiency**: SSMs offer linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length, which can maintain or reduce computational resources compared to traditional MLP layers. This is discussed in \"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\".\n\n### Potential Challenges and Solutions\n\n- **Training Stability**: Proper initialization and parameterization are crucial to maintain training stability. References such as \"On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\" and \"State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview\"[5.3] provide insights into these aspects.\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Simplifying the SSMs and focusing on efficient implementation strategies can mitigate the increased architectural complexity. For example, using simplified SSMs like S4D or exponential smoothing-based models can help.\n\n### Novelty and Differentiation\n\n- The proposed integration of Gated SSMs into the MLP layer of SwiGluMLP is distinct from existing designs that focus on integrating SSMs into attention mechanisms. This uniqueness is highlighted in the analysis note, emphasizing the novelty of enhancing the MLP component rather than the attention mechanism[Analysis Note, Section 3.4].\n\n### Key References\n\n- **\"Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\"** by Harsh Mehta et al.: This reference provides insights into the GSS layer and its benefits in long-range dependency modeling[5.1].\n- **\"DenseSSM: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models\"** by Wei He et al.: This paper discusses how to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs, which is relevant for integrating SSMs into the SwiGluMLP GAU[5.2].\n- **\"Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\"** by Albert Gu and Tri Dao: This work highlights the efficiency and performance benefits of using selective state spaces, which can be applied to the SwiGluMLP architecture.\n\nBy focusing on these points, the researcher can develop a detailed architectural design that integrates Gated SSMs into the SwiGluMLP GAU, ensuring improved long-range dependency modeling and computational efficiency while addressing potential challenges.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Here we propose a simple network architecture, gMLP, based on MLPs with gating, and show that it can perform as well as Transformers in key language and vision applications. Our comparisons show that self-attention is not critical for Vision Transformers, as gMLP can achieve the same accuracy.

On finetuning tasks where gMLP performs worse, making the gMLP model substantially larger can close the gap with Transformers. In general, our experiments show that gMLP can scale as well as Transformers over increased data and compute. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers [1] have enabled many breakthroughs in natural language processing (e.g., [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) and have been shown to work well for computer vision (e.g., $[7,8,9,10]$ ). Thanks to this success, Transformers have largely replaced LSTM-RNN [11] as the default architecture in NLP, and have become an appealing alternative to ConvNets $[12,13,14,15,16,17]$ in computer vision. The Transformer architecture combines two important concepts: (1) a recurrent-free architecture which computes the representations for each individual token in parallel, and (2) multi-head selfattention blocks which aggregate spatial information across tokens. On one hand, the attention mechanism [18] introduces the inductive bias that the spatial interactions should be dynamically parameterized based on the input representations. On the other hand, it is known that MLPs with static parameterization can represent arbitrary functions [19]. It therefore remains an open question whether the inductive bias in self-attention is essential to the remarkable effectiveness of Transformers. Here we study the necessity of self-attention modules in key language and vision applications of Transformers. Specifically, we propose an MLP-based alternative to Transformers without self-attention, which simply consists of channel projections and spatial projections with static parameterization. We experiment with several design choices for this architecture and find spatial projections work well when they are linear and paired with multiplicative gating (Figure 1). We name the model gMLP because it is built out of basic MLP layers with gating. We apply gMLP to image classification and obtain strong results on ImageNet. gMLP achieves comparable performance with DeiT [8], namely Vision Transformer (ViT) [7] with improved regularization, in a similar training setup. With $66 \\%$ less parameters, a gMLP model is $3 \\%$ more accurate than MLP-Mixer [20].\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformer-XL: Attentive Language Models Beyond a Fixed-Length Context (Avg.

Salakhutdinov*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2019)\t**Cited by** 3248  (*Influential: 394*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence, which consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/46 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nMultiMedia LLC. 2009.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 2. Branchformer: Parallel MLP-Attention Architectures to Capture Local and Global Context for Speech Recognition and Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*Yifan Peng, Siddharth Dalmia, Ian Lane, Shinji Watanabe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model.\n\n**Abstract:** Conformer has proven to be effective in many speech processing tasks. It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 3. Dissecting Recall of Factual Associations in Auto-Regressive Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*Mor Geva, Jasmijn Bastings, Katja Filippova, A. Globerson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored and extracted internally in LMs is introduced, facilitating future research on knowledge localization and editing.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models (LMs) are known to capture factual knowledge in their parameters. While previous work looked into where factual associations are stored, only little is known about how they are retrieved internally during inference. We investigate this question through the lens of information flow. Given a subject-relation query, we study how the model aggregates information about the subject and relation to predict the correct attribute. With interventions on attention edges, we first identify two critical points where information propagates to the prediction: one from the relation positions followed by another from the subject positions. Next, by analyzing the information at these points, we unveil a three-step internal mechanism for attribute extraction. First, the representation at the last-subject position goes through an enrichment process, driven by the early MLP sublayers, to encode many subject-related attributes. Second, information from the relation propagates to the prediction. Third, the prediction representation\"queries\"the enriched subject to extract the attribute. Perhaps surprisingly, this extraction is typically done via attention heads, which often encode subject-attribute mappings in their parameters. Overall, our findings introduce a comprehensive view of how factual associations are stored and extracted internally in LMs, facilitating future research on knowledge localization and editing.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 183  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 4. pNLP-Mixer: an Efficient all-MLP Architecture for Language\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*F.

Staar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the pNLP-Mixer architecture, an embedding-free MLP-Mixers model for on-device NLP that achieves high weight-efficiency thanks to a novel projection layer, and consistently beats the state-of-the-art of tiny models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models based on transformer architecture\u0192have drastically changed the natural language processing (NLP) landscape. However, deploying those models for on-device applications in constrained devices such as smart watches is completely impractical due to their size and inference cost. As an alternative to transformer-based architectures, recent work on efficient NLP has shown that weight-efficient models can attain competitive performance for simple tasks, such as slot filling and intent classification, with model sizes in the order of the megabyte. This work introduces the pNLP-Mixer architecture, an embedding-free MLP-Mixer model for on-device NLP that achieves high weight-efficiency thanks to a novel projection layer. We evaluate a pNLP-Mixer model of only one megabyte in size on two multi-lingual semantic parsing datasets, MTOP and multiATIS. Our quantized model achieves 99.4% and 97.8% the performance of mBERT on MTOP and multiATIS, while using 170x less parameters. Our model consistently beats the state-of-the-art of tiny models (pQRNN), which is twice as large, by a margin up to 7.8% on MTOP.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. A Mechanistic Interpretation of Arithmetic Reasoning in Language Models using Causal Mediation Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*Alessandro Stolfo, Yonatan Belinkov, Mrinmaya Sachan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A mechanistic interpretation of Transformer-based LMs on arithmetic questions using a causal mediation analysis framework is presented and results indicate that LMs process the input by transmitting the information relevant to the query from mid-sequence early layers to the final token using the attention mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Mathematical reasoning in large language models (LMs) has garnered significant attention in recent work, but there is a limited understanding of how these models process and store information related to arithmetic tasks within their architecture. In order to improve our understanding of this aspect of language models, we present a mechanistic interpretation of Transformer-based LMs on arithmetic questions using a causal mediation analysis framework. By intervening on the activations of specific model components and measuring the resulting changes in predicted probabilities, we identify the subset of parameters responsible for specific predictions. This provides insights into how information related to arithmetic is processed by LMs. Our experimental results indicate that LMs process the input by transmitting the information relevant to the query from mid-sequence early layers to the final token using the attention mechanism. Then, this information is processed by a set of MLP modules, which generate result-related information that is incorporated into the residual stream. To assess the specificity of the observed activation dynamics, we compare the effects of different model components on arithmetic queries with other tasks, including number retrieval from prompts and factual knowledge questions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Activator: GLU Activation Function as the Core Component of a Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*Tarkan Aydin, Abdullah Nazhat Abdullah*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture currently represents the main driver behind many successes in a variety of tasks addressed by deep learning, especially the recent advances in natural language processing (NLP) culminating with large language models (LLM). In addition, transformer architecture has found a wide spread of interest from computer vision (CV) researchers and practitioners, allowing for many advancements in vision-related tasks and opening the door for multi-task and multi-modal deep learning architectures that share the same principle of operation. One drawback to these architectures is their reliance on the scaled dot product attention mechanism with the softmax activation function, which is computationally expensive and requires large compute capabilities both for training and inference. This paper investigates substituting the attention mechanism usually adopted for transformer architecture with an architecture incorporating gated linear unit (GLU) activation within a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) structure in conjunction with the default MLP incorporated in the traditional transformer design. Another step forward taken by this paper is to eliminate the second non-gated MLP to further reduce the computational cost. Experimental assessments conducted by this research show that both proposed modifications and reductions offer competitive performance in relation to baseline architectures, in support of the aims of this work in establishing a more efficient yet capable alternative to the traditional attention mechanism as the core component in designing transformer architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 2. Enhancing Temporal Modeling of Video LLMs via Time Gating\n\n*From Search Query: MLP architectures language models gating mechanisms*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Michael R. Lyu, Shijia Huang, Yiwu Zhong, Zi-Yuan Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs) have achieved impressive performance on video-and-language tasks, such as video question answering. However, most existing Video LLMs neglect temporal information in video data, leading to struggles with temporal-aware video understanding. To address this gap, we propose a Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) designed to enhance temporal modeling through a novel Time Gating module (TG). The TG module employs a time gating mechanism on its sub-modules, comprising gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP. This architecture enables our model to achieve a robust understanding of temporal information within videos. Extensive evaluation of temporal-sensitive video benchmarks (i.e., MVBench, TempCompass, and NExT-QA) demonstrates that our TG-Vid model significantly outperforms the existing Video LLMs. Further, comprehensive ablation studies validate that the performance gains are attributed to the designs of our TG module. Our code is available at https://github.com/LaVi-Lab/TG-Vid.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on MLP architectures, gating mechanisms, and their integration, here are some key findings and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## MLP Architectures in Language Models\n\n- Transformer models, which are widely used in language models, often incorporate Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) as part of their feed-forward network (FFN) blocks. These FFNs typically consist of two linear transformations with a non-linear activation function in between.\n- A variant of the FFN, known as the \"Gated FFN,\" introduces an additional gating mechanism. This allows the model to learn more complex patterns by controlling the flow of information through the network, which can be particularly beneficial in capturing nuanced relationships in language data.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- Gating mechanisms are crucial in various neural network architectures. For instance, the Time Gating module (TG) in the Time Gating Video LLM (TG-Vid) model employs gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP to enhance temporal modeling in video data. This approach can be adapted to improve temporal or contextual understanding in language models as well.\n- In the context of language models, gating mechanisms can be integrated into the MLP blocks to control the flow of information, similar to how they are used in other domains like video processing.\n\n## Integration of MLPs with State Space Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss the integration of MLPs with state space models in language models, the concept of combining different architectural elements is relevant. State space models (SSMs) can be combined with various activation functions and gating mechanisms to enhance their expressiveness and stability. This principle can be applied to language models by integrating SSMs with MLPs and gating mechanisms to improve their ability to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between Different MLP Variants\n\n- The performance of different MLP variants, such as standard FFNs and Gated FFNs, can be compared based on their ability to capture complex patterns and their computational efficiency. Gated FFNs generally offer better performance in tasks requiring the modeling of complex relationships due to their ability to control information flow.\n- The choice of activation functions within these MLP blocks also significantly impacts performance. Functions like ReLU, GELU, and SiLU have different advantages and can be chosen based on the specific requirements of the model.\n\n## Memory-Efficient MLP Implementations\n\n- To achieve memory efficiency, techniques such as layer normalization and the omission of biases in certain projections can be employed. For example, the ViT-22B model eliminates biases in the QKV projections and LayerNorms, which enhances resource utilization by 3%.\n- Asynchronous parallel linear operations can also be used to improve device efficiency during matrix multiplication, which is a common operation in MLP blocks.\n\n### Practical Implementations and Recent Developments\n\n- Recent developments in transformer architectures, such as the use of parallel layers, allow for the simultaneous execution of attention and MLP blocks. This approach, seen in models like PaLM, can reduce training time and improve efficiency.\n- The use of learnable gating mechanisms, as seen in BioLLMNet, can effectively fuse features from different modalities and improve the predictive power of the model. This concept can be applied to language models to enhance their performance in various tasks.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can design more efficient and effective autoregressive language models that leverage advanced MLP architectures, gating mechanisms, and state space models to achieve better performance, scalability, and memory efficiency.\n",

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 4.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: state space models SwiGLU MLP gating\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

It combines the benefits of extracting local dependencies using convolutions and global dependencies using self-attention. Inspired by this, we propose a more flexible, interpretable and customizable encoder alternative, Branchformer, with parallel branches for modeling various ranged dependencies in end-to-end speech processing. In each encoder layer, one branch employs self-attention or its variant to capture long-range dependencies, while the other branch utilizes an MLP module with convolutional gating (cgMLP) to extract local relationships. We conduct experiments on several speech recognition and spoken language understanding benchmarks. Results show that our model outperforms both Transformer and cgMLP. It also matches with or outperforms state-of-the-art results achieved by Conformer. Furthermore, we show various strategies to reduce computation thanks to the two-branch architecture, including the ability to have variable inference complexity in a single trained model. The weights learned for merging branches indicate how local and global dependencies are utilized in different layers, which benefits model designing.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models SwiGLU MLP gating*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Parametric Approximations of Neural Network Function Space Distance\n\n*From Search Query: state space models SwiGLU MLP gating*\n\n*Nikita Dhawan, Sicong Huang, Juhan Bae, R.

As a specific case, we consider estimating the Function Space Distance (FSD) over a training set, i.e. the average discrepancy between the outputs of two neural networks. We propose a Linearized Activation Function TRick (LAFTR) and derive an efficient approximation to FSD for ReLU neural networks. The key idea is to approximate the architecture as a linear network with stochastic gating. Despite requiring only one parameter per unit of the network, our approach outcompetes other parametric approximations with larger memory requirements. Applied to continual learning, our parametric approximation is competitive with state-of-the-art nonparametric approximations, which require storing many training examples. Furthermore, we show its efficacy in estimating influence functions accurately and detecting mislabeled examples without expensive iterations over the entire dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: state space models SwiGLU MLP gating*\n\n*Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hybrid model is introduced, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently, and suggests that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5. Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: state space models SwiGLU MLP gating*\n\n*Harsh Mehta, Ankit Gupta, Ashok Cutkosky, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and shows that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models have shown to be effective at modeling long range dependencies, specially on sequence classification tasks. In this work we focus on autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and ArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the effectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated State Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several well-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 174  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating state space models (SSMs) with SwiGLU activation and MLP blocks, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and the detailed analysis:\n\n## Integration of State Space Models in MLP Blocks\n\n- While the sources do not directly discuss the integration of SSMs with SwiGLU in MLP blocks, the concept of using gated linear units (GLUs) and SwiGLU in transformer architectures provides a foundation. For instance, the paper on \"\\modelname: Transformers Are Effective Spatial-Temporal Predictive ...\" discusses the use of SwiGLU in place of simple linear transformations within transformer blocks, which could be a starting point for integrating SSMs.\n\n## Interaction between SSMs and Activation Functions\n\n- The interaction between SSMs and activation functions like SwiGLU would involve analyzing how the state space dynamics interact with the gating mechanism of SwiGLU. The paper on \"\\modelname\" mentions that SwiGLU involves the element-wise product of two linear projections, with one passing through a sigmoid or Swish activation function. This could be extended to incorporate SSMs by integrating state space dynamics into the linear projections or the activation functions themselves.\n\n## Gating Mechanisms in MLP Layers\n\n- The Time Gating Module (TG) proposed in the \"Time Gating Video LLM\" paper provides a relevant example of gating mechanisms in MLP layers. This module uses gating spatial attention, gating temporal attention, and gating MLP, which are module-specific and conditioned on both the input and output of the sub-module. This approach could be adapted for SSM-SwiGLU integration to enhance the gating mechanism in MLP layers.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of SSMs\n\n- For memory-efficient implementations, the paper on \"\\modelname\" highlights the use of pure gated transformer blocks that eliminate inductive biases inherent in CNNs, leading to fewer parameters and lower FLOPs. This approach could be applied to SSMs to make them more memory-efficient. Additionally, the focus on scalable architectures like those in \"\\modelname\" suggests that integrating SSMs with such designs could maintain efficiency while scaling up the model.\n\n## Performance Comparisons Between SSM Variants and Traditional Architectures\n\n- To compare the performance of SSM variants with traditional architectures, one would need to conduct empirical studies similar to those in the \"\\modelname\" paper. This involves evaluating the model on various benchmarks and comparing the results with existing state-of-the-art models. The \"Time Gating Video LLM\" paper provides a framework for such comparisons by evaluating the TG-Vid model on temporal-sensitive video benchmarks and showing significant performance gains over existing Video LLMs.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Trade-offs Between Expressiveness and Computational Efficiency**: When integrating SSMs with SwiGLU, it is crucial to analyze the trade-offs between the expressiveness of the model and its computational efficiency. The use of SwiGLU has been shown to outperform traditional MLPs in various tasks, but adding SSMs could introduce additional computational complexity that needs to be balanced.\n\n- **Impact on Gradient Flow and Training Stability**: The gating mechanisms, especially those that are module-specific like in the TG module, can significantly impact gradient flow and training stability. Analyzing these aspects, as suggested in the initial analysis, is vital to ensure that the integrated model trains stably and efficiently.\n\n- **Scalability with Sequence Length**: The scalability of the proposed design with sequence length is another critical aspect. The \"\\modelname\" paper demonstrates that pure gated transformer blocks can be highly scalable, which suggests that integrating SSMs with such architectures could maintain scalability while improving performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop a comprehensive understanding of how to integrate SSMs with SwiGLU in MLP blocks, ensuring improved performance, efficiency, and scalability in autoregressive language models.\n",

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content. (Right Bottom) The Induction Heads task is an example of associative recall that requires retrieving an answer based on context, a key ability for LLMs. ```\nAlgorithm 1 SSM (S4)\nAlgorithm 2 SSM + Selection (S6)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\n    1: \\(A:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    1: \\(\\boldsymbol{A}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n\\(\\triangleright\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n                            \\(>\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n        B \\(:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    2: \\(\\boldsymbol{B}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow s_{B}(x)\\)\n        \\(C:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n        \\(\\Delta:(\\mathrm{D}) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\) (Parameter)\n        \\(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, A, B)\\)\n        \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n            \\(\\Delta\\) Time-invariant: recurrence or convolution\n    return \\(y\\)\n    3: \\(C:(B, L, N) \\leftarrow s_{C}(x)\\)\n    4: \\(\\Delta:(B, L, D) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\left(\\right.\\) Parameter \\(\\left.+s_{\\Delta}(x)\\right)\\)\n    5: \\(\\bar{A}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})\\)\n    6: \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n        \\(\\Delta\\) Time-varying: recurrence (scan) only\n    7: return \\(y\\)\n```\n\n\n### 3.3 Efficient Implementation of Selective SSMs\n\nHardware-friendly primitives such as convolutions (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) enjoy widespread application. Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# State Space Models as Foundation Models: A Control Theoretic Overview \n\nCarmen Amo Alonso*, Jerome Sieber*, and Melanie N.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: gated state space models neural networks implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: gated state space models neural networks implementation*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3.

We identify and study the $\\textit{Clifford group}$, a subgroup inside the Clifford algebra tailored to achieve several favorable properties. Primarily, the group's action forms an orthogonal automorphism that extends beyond the typical vector space to the entire Clifford algebra while respecting the multivector grading. This leads to several non-equivalent subrepresentations corresponding to the multivector decomposition. Furthermore, we prove that the action respects not just the vector space structure of the Clifford algebra but also its multiplicative structure, i.e., the geometric product. These findings imply that every polynomial in multivectors, An advantage worth mentioning is that we obtain expressive layers that can elegantly generalize to inner-product spaces of any dimension. We demonstrate, notably from a single core implementation, state-of-the-art performance on several distinct tasks, including a three-dimensional $n$-body experiment, a four-dimensional Lorentz-equivariant high-energy physics experiment, and a five-dimensional convex hull experiment.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 187  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 5.

However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Hardware Synthesis of State-Space Equations; Application to FPGA Implementation of Shallow and Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gated state space models neural networks implementation*\n\n*Reza Sameni, Pezhman Torabi, Amir-Hossein Kiamarzi*\n\n**Abstract:** Nowadays, shallow and deep Neural Networks (NNs) have vast applications including biomedical engineering, image processing, computer vision, and speech recognition. Many researchers have developed hardware accelerators including field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) for implementing high-performance and energy efficient NNs. Apparently, the hardware architecture design process is specific and time-consuming for each NN. Therefore, a systematic way to design, implement and optimize NNs is highly demanded. The paper presents a systematic approach to implement state-space models in register transfer level (RTL), with special interest for NN implementation. The proposed design flow is based on the iterative nature of state-space models and the analogy between state-space formulations and finite-state machines. The method can be used in linear/nonlinear and time-varying/time-invariant systems. It can also be used to implement either intrinsically iterative systems (widely used in various domains such as signal processing, numerical analysis, computer arithmetic, and control engineering), or systems that could be rewritten in equivalent iterative forms. The implementation of recurrent NNs such as long short-term memory (LSTM) NNs, which have intrinsic state-space forms, are another major applications for this framework. As a case study, it is shown that state-space systems can be used for the systematic implementation and optimization of NNs (as nonlinear and time-varying dynamic systems). An RTL code generating software is also provided online, which simplifies the automatic generation of NNs of arbitrary size.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design using gated state space models (SSMs), here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n### Specific Implementations of Gated SSMs in Neural Networks\n\n- The paper \"Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners\" introduces a novel deep SSM architecture that incorporates gating mechanisms. It conceptualizes SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems, using implicit updates to optimize an online regression objective. This approach includes a gated linear unit (GLU) and state-dependent linear projections, which are similar to the mechanisms used in gated recurrent units (GRUs) but tailored for SSMs.\n\n- The \"Mamba\" model, mentioned in the analysis, also uses selective state spaces, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. This is achieved by letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input, which addresses the weakness of discrete modalities in sequence modeling [Analysis].\n\n### Design Considerations for Combining SSMs with Activation Functions\n\n- The \"Longhorn\" paper discusses the integration of SSMs with activation functions, particularly through the use of a channel mixing gated linear unit (GLU). This involves a state-dependent linear projection followed by a non-linear activation function, which helps in optimizing the state updates based on online learning objectives.\n\n- The interaction between SSMs and activation functions like SwiGLU can be inferred from the need to balance the expressiveness of the model with computational efficiency. The use of gating mechanisms in SSMs can be seen as analogous to the gating in GRUs and LSTMs, which helps in managing the flow of information through the model.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Architectures Using SSMs\n\n- State Space Models (SSMs) are highlighted for their linear complexity in handling long sequences, which makes them memory-efficient compared to traditional transformers and RNNs. The \"Longhorn\" and \"Mamba\" models demonstrate how SSMs can be designed to maintain a fixed-size state, resulting in constant time inference and linear-time training.\n\n- The \"S6\" models, which integrate the S4 model with a selection mechanism computed via a scan, are designed to optimize GPU memory usage. This approach allows for efficient implementation with memory requirements comparable to optimized transformer implementations.\n\n### Performance Analysis of Gated SSM Implementations\n\n- The \"Longhorn\" paper provides experimental results showing that their novel SSM architecture outperforms state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks. This includes a 1.8x speedup in certain tasks.\n\n- The performance of gated SSMs is also analyzed in terms of their ability to handle long-range dependencies and context compression. The selective state updates in models like Mamba and Longhorn enhance the model's performance by allowing it to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.\n\n### Integration Strategies for SSMs in Existing Architectures\n\n- Integrating SSMs into existing architectures, such as transformers or MLPs, requires careful consideration of parameter initialization, stability, and the interaction between SSMs and other components. The \"Longhorn\" paper suggests that SSMs can be viewed as solving online learning problems, which can guide the integration with other models by aligning the learning objectives.\n\n- The \"S6\" models provide a framework for integrating SSMs with selective mechanisms, which can be applied to various sequence modeling tasks. This integration involves designing the SSM parameters to depend on the input through linear projections, enhancing the model's ability to manage context effectively.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of gated state space models.\n",

Our results show the possibility that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating the functions in certain classes that appear in practice. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models based on Transformers have achieved remarkable success in various sequence modeling tasks such as natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), and speech recognition (Radford et al., 2023). The superior performance of Transformers is attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to aggregate the information from the input sequence. In contrast to its success, self-attention mechanism has a potential problem that it requires a large amount of computation and memory. To deal with this issue, many studies have been attempted to develop efficient models that can replace Transformers. Among them, Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered considerable interest recently. One advantage of SSMs is that the output can be computed with a significantly small time using convolution via FFT algorithm or recursive computation. Based on the original SSMs, many improvements have been proposed, such as HiPPO-based intialization (Gu et al. 2021) and architectures using gated convolutions (Fu et al. 2022, Poli et al., 2023). Networks based on SSMs have accomplished high performance in various applications such as gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2024), audio generation (Goel et al., 2022) and speech recognition (Saon et al. 2023). On the other hand, some of the recent studies pointed out the limitations of SSMs, especially for their abilities to solve tasks. For example, Merrill et al. (2024) show that SSMs cannot solve sequential problems from the view of computational complexity theory. Additionally, Gu and Dao (2023) pointed out that SSMs are less effective for the tasks to handle discrete and information-dense data such as language processing. Therefore, it is still unclear in what situation we can replace Transformers with SSMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5e098f2beaae0c90c478g-02.jpg?height=258&width=1373&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1.1: Conceptual illustrations of the abilities of SSMs. Left: This represents the classification task in which the existence of the token \" $A$ \" or \" $B$ \" is important. We prove that SSMs can extract such tokens, even if the position of the important token is different for each input. Right: This illustrate the task to predict the next token in the sequence. In this task, models have to output the token associated with the last token. We also prove that SSMs can solve such tasks, i.e., SSMs can extract appropriate tokens even if the position of essential tokens are different for each token in the same sequence. Recently, some studies have theoretically investigated the abilities of SSMs. For instance, Wang and Xue (2024) show that SSMs are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Additionally, Massaroli et al. (2024) constructed the parameters of SSMs to solve the task called associated recall. Moreover, Cirone et al. (2024) studied the abilities of SSMs using rough path theory. However, they mainly focus on the expressive power of SSMs and do not provide statistical understanding. Furthermore, quantitative evaluations to compare SSMs and Transformers is limited. Leaving aside SSMs, many studies have investigated the abilities of deep neural networks to estimate functions. Some of them analyze the estimation abilities of fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with the assumption that the target function is in certain function classes (Schmidt-Hieber, 2020, Suzuki, 2018) or have a specific smoothness structure (Suzuki and Nitanda, 2021). Moreover, Nakada and Imaizumi (2020) and Chen et al. (2022) consider the setting that the data distribution has a low-dimensional structure. Additionally, Okumoto and Suzuki (2021) studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and showed that CNNs can estimate the functions that have smoothness structures with the minimax optimal rate even if the input is infinite-dimensional. As for the Transformers, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate the functions with infinitedimensional input as well as CNNs. Additionally, they showed that Transformers can estimate the functions whose smoothness structure changes depending on the input. Our contributions. In this paper, we explore the abilities of SSMs with gated convolution to replace Transformers from the perspective of statistical learning theory. More specifically, we investigate the estimation ability of SSMs for the function classes called $\\gamma$-smooth and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth. For the function in these classes, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate them effectively. We prove that SSMs can also estimate those functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers, and show that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating those functions. The essential point of the two function classes above is that they have smoothness structures. As for $\\gamma$-smooth functions, the smoothness of the function is the same for all input sequences, i.e., the important features to extract are fixed. On the other hand, piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions have different smoothness depending on the input. This function class characterizes the ability of Transformers and SSMs to extract important features dynamically. In addition to the settings considered in Takakura and Suzuki (2023), we also consider the functions whose smoothness structure also changes depending on the position output token. This setting is inspired by the ability of Transformers to solve the task called associative recall (Ba et al. 2016). We show that SSMs can also replace Transformers in this setting. See Figure 1.1 for the conceptual illustrations of those function classes. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We theoretically investigate the estimation ability of SSMs with gated convolutions for $\\gamma$ smooth functions and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions. We show that SSMs can achieve the same estimation error as Transformers, which implies that SSMs may be alternative to Transformers in terms of estimating functions in those classes. 2. Inspired by recent research on the abilities of Transformers, we define function classes that are extensions of the piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth function class. Then, we prove that SSMs can also attain the similar estimation error for those classes. Other related works. The function classes with piecewise smoothness are also considered in Petersen and Voigtlaender (2018) and Imaizumi and Fukumizu (2019). They do not consider anisotropic smoothness or the sequence-to-sequence functions, while we consider such situations. One of the other directions to investigate the abilities of SSMs is to utilize the control theory, like Alonso et al. (2024). Instead of focusing on the statistical aspect, they mainly provide a comprehensive understanding of existing SSMs. Gu and DaO (2023) proposed an SSM-based architecture called Mamba, whose filter is controlled by the input. While convolution with FFT algorithms cannot be used for Mamba, they proposed a hardware-aware efficient implementation. In this paper, we do not focus on the setting that filters are controlled by the input, and we consider SSMs with gated convolution with data-independent filters.\n```\n\n#### 2. Structured state-space models are deep Wiener models (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Fabio Bonassi, Carl R. Andersson, Per Mattsson, Thomas B.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form. At last, we highlight future research directions for which this community could provide impactful contributions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/22 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n(2022), and mainly involves stability promotion via regularization. To address these problems, Gu et al. (2021) proposed a Structured State-space Model (SSM) architecture named S4, which consists of multiple layers composed by LTI discrete-time systems followed by a nonlinear function. The term \"structured\" stems from the fact that this LTI system is given a specific structure to improve the architecture's modeling performances while also reducing the computational cost at training (Yu et al., 2018). Nonlinear state-space models are not new, see Marconato et al. (2013), yet their adoption has been hampered by their crucial reliance on the model structure and on the initialization method of learnable parameters. The contribution of the S4 approach towards SSMs has therefore been that of providing ( $i$ ) a novel, intrinsically stable, parametrization of the LTI system obtained by discretizing a continuoustime Diagonal Plus-Low Rank (DPLR) system, (ii) a new strategy towards the parameters' initialization problem, (iii) a computationally efficient approach to simulate (and train) these models over extremely long sequences, and (iv) an empirical proof of the state-of-the-art performances of these models in long-term sequence learning problems. Motivated by these appealing features, many works have continued to build on the S4 architecture. For example, Gupta et al. (2022) and Gu et al. (2022) have explored the benefits entailed by stricter SSM structures, namely the parametrization via diagonal continuous-time systems (S4D), and by simpler initialization strategies. Smith et al. (2022) have explored a novel, and somewhat more computationally efficient, simulation method for diagonal continuous-time parametrizations, named S5. Orvieto et al. (2023) recently investigated the parametrization of the LTI subsystems directly in the discrete time domain, resulting in the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) architecture. Contribution Despite the appealing results achieved by SSMs in the long-range arena benchmarks sequence classification problems, their use for nonlinear system identification is still unexplored. With this paper, we want to change that by making the following contributions. First of all we show that it is possible to interpret SSMs as deep Wiener models, i.e. model structures where several Wiener models are interconnected in series. An interesting note here is that even though the Wiener models have been extremely popular within system identification - see e.g. Schoukens and Tiels (2017) and references therein - their structure has been limited to \"single-layer\" or parallel architectures (Wills and Ninness, 2012). Our second contribution is to dissect the recent developments on SSMs and explain them in terms of their structure and parameterization, and to clearly separate this from their initialization, simulation, and training strategies. The presentation in the paper is also done using the language commonly used in the system identification community in order to speed up the use of these tools within this area. Notation The imaginary unit is denoted by $i=\\sqrt{-1}$. Given a vector $v$, we denote by $v^{\\prime}$ its real transpose. For a time-dependent vector, the discrete-time index $k$ is reported as a subscript, e.g., $v_{k}$. Moreover, we denote by $v_{a: b}$ (where $a \\leqslant b$ ) the sequence $v_{a: b}=\\left(v_{a}, v_{a+1}, \\ldots, v_{b}\\right)$. For this sequence, we indicate by $\\operatorname{cat}\\left(v_{a: b}\\right)$ the concatenation of its elements, i.e. $\\operatorname{cat}\\left(v_{a: b}\\right)=\\left[v_{a}^{\\prime}, \\ldots, v_{b}^{\\prime}\\right]^{\\prime}$, and by uncat $(\\cdot)$ its inverse operation returning a sequence of vectors given their concatenation. Given a complex matrix $A$, we let $\\operatorname{conj}(A)$ be its element-wise complex conjugate and $A^{*}$ be its Hermitian transpose. Diagonal matrices may be defined via the $\\operatorname{diag}$ operator, as $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$. ## 2. STRUCTURED STATE-SPACE MODELS\n\nConsider the model depicted in Figure 1, which consists of $L$ Wiener systems interconnected in series. Each of these layers is here referred to as Structured Statespace Layer (SSL). Their interconnection results in an SSM, which can be interpreted as a specific configuration of a deep Wiener system. We let the generic $\\ell$-th SSL $(\\ell \\in\\{1, \\ldots, L\\})$ be represented by a discrete-time statespace model\n\n$$\n\\mathrm{SSL}_{\\ell}:\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\nx_{k+1}=A x_{k}+B u_{k} \\\\\n\\eta_{k}=C x_{k}+D u_{k} \\\\\ny_{k}=\\sigma\\left(\\eta_{k}\\right)+F u_{k}\n\\end{array}\\right. $$\n\nwhere, for compactness, the layer index is omitted. System (1) is characterized by the input vector $u \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{u}}$, the intermediate vector $\\eta \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}$, the output vector $y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n_{y}}$, and the complex-valued state vector $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n_{x}}$. The SSL is parametrized by the matrices $\\{A, B, C, D, F\\}$. The output transformation $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ can be any nonlinear, Lipschitzcontinuous activation function, such as the tanh, ELU, or Swish, see Ramachandran et al. (2017). In what follows, we aim to provide an overview of the possible structure, parametrization, initialization, and simulation strategies for this SSL. Remark 1. When a deep SSM is considered $(L>1)$, each layer is parametrized and initialized independently from the others. The simulation is carried out iteratively over the set of layers, meaning that the output sequence of the $\\ell$-th layer is used as input of the layer $\\ell+1$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n#### 4.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 5. Unlocking the Secrets of Linear Complexity Sequence Model from A Unified Perspective (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Xuyang Shen, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Stan Birchfield, Richard Hartley, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Linear Complexity Sequence Model (LCSM), a comprehensive solution that unites various sequence modeling techniques with linear complexity, including linear attention, state space model, long convolution, and linear RNN, within a single framework. The goal is to enhance comprehension of these models by analyzing the impact of each component from a cohesive and streamlined viewpoint. Specifically, we segment the modeling processes of these models into three distinct stages: Expand, Oscillation, and Shrink (EOS), with each model having its own specific settings. The Expand stage involves projecting the input signal onto a high-dimensional memory state. This is followed by recursive operations performed on the memory state in the Oscillation stage. Finally, the memory state is projected back to a low-dimensional space in the Shrink stage. We perform comprehensive experiments to analyze the impact of different stage settings on language modeling and retrieval tasks. Our results show that data-driven methods are crucial for the effectiveness of the three stages in language modeling, whereas hand-crafted methods yield better performance in retrieval tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nFor instance, a setting of \" $0-0-0-0$ \" signifies the use of linear parameterization, with all states being data independent and no activation function being utilized. ## 3. Experiments\n\nWe perform extensive experiments to evaluate the model variants in language modeling performance and longcontext recall capabilities on WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2017) dataset and the multi-query associative recall (MQAR) task (Arora et al., 2023). The experiment setups are delineated below. For the convergence experiments on WikiText-103, we adhered to the configuration outlined in prior studies (Qin et al., 2023a). Specifically, we employed a batch size of 128, and a sequence length of 512 , and ran the experiments for 50,000 iterations. The learning rate was set to $5 \\mathrm{e}-4$, with complete hyperparameters listed in Appendix 6. For the MQAR task, we standardized the expand ratio $k$ for all models to 128 . We conducted a grid search for the learning rate, spanning values from $\\{1 \\mathrm{e}-5,5 \\mathrm{e}-5,1 \\mathrm{e}-4$, $5 \\mathrm{e}-$ $4,1 e-3,5 e-3,1 e-2\\}$, and reported the best results for each model. Additionally, we tested various sequence lengths 32, $64,128,256$, and feature dimensions $64,128,256,512$ to determine the optimal configuration. ### 3.1. Experiments on Wikitext-103\n\nParameterization Test. We carried out a comparison between SSM parameterization and naive parameterization, with the findings presented in Table 5. The analysis revealed that SSM parameterization showed inferior performance compared to naive parameterization on the Wikitext dataset. Data Dependence Test. We proceeded to assess the extent of dependency on data-dependent states, as shown in Table 4. Analysis of the Wikitext data indicates that when all EOS states $(e, o, s)$ are non-data-dependent, the performance is notably subpar, even worse than the scenario where the $o$ state is not learnable. Introducing data dependence on just one of these elements, particularly on the $o$ state $(0-$ $1-0-0)$, demonstrates the most significant effectiveness. When data dependence is introduced on two elements, the combination of $o$ and $s(1-1-0-0)$ proves to be the most effective, yielding results comparable to scenarios where $e$, $o$, and $s$ are all data-dependent. O Types Test. In Table 4, we evaluated various strategies for constructing the $o$ state. A method we labeled as $1-9-$ $1-0$, yielded the most favorable outcomes. This approach outperformed the $1-1-1-0$ configuration. On the other hand, methods that relied on a naive o state (such as linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b)) demonstrated inferior performance. Activation Functions Test. Then we examined the influence of activation functions on the outcomes, results are presented in Table 6. It's clear that employing activation functions yields considerable benefits, with silu and relu ${ }^{2}$ demonstrating the most favorable performance.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. What functions can Graph Neural Networks compute on random graphs? The role of Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*Nicolas Keriven, Samuel Vaiter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks is provided, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples, and the role of input node features is emphasized.\n\n**Abstract:** We aim to deepen the theoretical understanding of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs, with a focus on their expressive power. Existing analyses relate this notion to the graph isomorphism problem, which is mostly relevant for graphs of small sizes, or studied graph classification or regression tasks, while prediction tasks on nodes are far more relevant on large graphs. Recently, several works showed that, on very general random graphs models, GNNs converge to certains functions as the number of nodes grows. In this paper, we provide a more complete and intuitive description of the function space generated by equivariant GNNs for node-tasks, through general notions of convergence that encompass several previous examples. We emphasize the role of input node features, and study the impact of node Positional Encodings (PEs), a recent line of work that has been shown to yield state-of-the-art results in practice. Through the study of several examples of PEs on large random graphs, we extend previously known universality results to significantly more general models. Our theoretical results hint at some normalization tricks, which is shown numerically to have a positive impact on GNN generalization on synthetic and real data. Our proofs contain new concentration inequalities of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Tractable Function-Space Variational Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*Tim G. J. Rudner, Zonghao Chen, Y. Teh, Y. Gal*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work frames Bayesian inference in neural networks explicitly as inferring a posterior distribution over functions and proposes a scalable function-space variational inference method that allows incorporating prior information and results in reliable predictive uncertainty estimates.\n\n**Abstract:** Reliable predictive uncertainty estimation plays an important role in enabling the deployment of neural networks to safety-critical settings. A popular approach for estimating the predictive uncertainty of neural networks is to define a prior distribution over the network parameters, infer an approximate posterior distribution, and use it to make stochastic predictions. However, explicit inference over neural network parameters makes it difficult to incorporate meaningful prior information about the data-generating process into the model. In this paper, we pursue an alternative approach. Recognizing that the primary object of interest in most settings is the distribution over functions induced by the posterior distribution over neural network parameters, we frame Bayesian inference in neural networks explicitly as inferring a posterior distribution over functions and propose a scalable function-space variational inference method that allows incorporating prior information and results in reliable predictive uncertainty estimates. We show that the proposed method leads to state-of-the-art uncertainty estimation and predictive performance on a range of prediction tasks and demonstrate that it performs well on a challenging safety-critical medical diagnosis task in which reliable uncertainty estimation is essential.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Fiorucci, J. Topin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work abstracts the biological process of protein-molecule activation as the injection of a molecule into a protein-specific environment and proposes a tailored GNN architecture incorporating inductive biases from the protein-molecule binding that outperforms state-of-the-art models on drug-target interaction prediction as well as standard GNN baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Odor perception in mammals is triggered by interactions between volatile organic compounds and a subset of hundreds of proteins called olfactory receptors (ORs). Molecules activate these receptors in a complex combinatorial coding allowing mammals to discriminate a vast number of chemical stimuli. Recently, ORs have gained attention as new therapeutic targets following the discovery of their involvement in other physiological processes and diseases. To date, predicting molecule-induced activation for ORs is highly challenging since 43% of ORs have no identified active compound. In this work, we combine [CLS] token from protBERT with a molecular graph and propose a tailored GNN architecture incorporating inductive biases from the protein-molecule binding. We abstract the biological process of protein-molecule activation as the injection of a molecule into a protein-specific environment. On a newly gathered dataset of 46 700 OR-molecule pairs, this model outperforms state-of-the-art models on drug-target interaction prediction as well as standard GNN baselines. Moreover, by incorporating non-bonded interactions the model is able to work with mixtures of compounds. Finally, our predictions reveal a similar activation pattern for molecules within a given odor family, which is in agreement with the theory of combinatorial coding in olfaction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Continuous-time identification of dynamic state-space models by deep subspace encoding\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*G. Beintema, M. Schoukens, R. T'oth*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and it is shown that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Abstract:** Continuous-time (CT) modeling has proven to provide improved sample efficiency and interpretability in learning the dynamical behavior of physical systems compared to discrete-time (DT) models. However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

To exploit these relationships in making downstream predictions, a variety of hypergraph neural network architectures have recently been proposed, in large part building upon precursors from the more traditional graph neural network (GNN) literature. Somewhat differently, in this paper we begin by presenting an expressive family of parameterized, hypergraph-regularized energy functions. We then demonstrate how minimizers of these energies effectively serve as node embeddings that, when paired with a parameterized classifier, can be trained end-to-end via a supervised bilevel optimization process. Later, we draw parallels between the implicit architecture of the predictive models emerging from the proposed bilevel hypergraph optimization, and existing GNN architectures in common use. Empirically, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results on various hypergraph node classification benchmarks.

Kervolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*Lihua Xie, Junsong Yuan, Jianfei Yang, Chen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have enabled the state-of-the-art performance in many computer vision tasks. However, little effort has been devoted to establishing convolution in non-linear space. Existing works mainly leverage on the activation layers, which can only provide point-wise non-linearity. To solve this problem, a new operation, kervolution (kernel convolution), is introduced to approximate complex behaviors of human perception systems leveraging on the kernel trick. It generalizes convolution, enhances the model capacity, and captures higher order interactions of features, via patch-wise kernel functions, but without introducing additional parameters. Extensive experiments show that kervolutional neural networks (KNN) achieve higher accuracy and faster convergence than baseline CNN.\n\n**Conference:** kervolutional-neural-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Inductive Graph Transformer for Delivery Time Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*Cyril Leung, Zhiqi Shen, Xingyu Wu, Yong liu, Jinglong Wang, Xin Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Providing accurate estimated time of package delivery on users' purchasing pages for e-commerce platforms is of great importance to their purchasing decisions and post-purchase experiences. Although this problem shares some common issues with the conventional estimated time of arrival (ETA), it is more challenging with the following aspects: 1) Inductive inference. Models are required to predict ETA for orders with unseen retailers and addresses; 2) High-order interaction of order semantic information. Apart from the spatio-temporal features, the estimated time also varies greatly with other factors, such as the packaging efficiency of retailers, as well as the high-order interaction of these factors. In this paper, we propose an inductive graph transformer (IGT) that leverages raw feature information and structural graph data to estimate package delivery time. Different from previous graph transformer architectures, IGT adopts a decoupled pipeline and trains transformer as a regression function that can capture the multiplex information from both raw feature and dense embeddings encoded by a graph neural network (GNN). In addition, we further simplify the GNN structure by removing its non-linear activation and the learnable linear transformation matrix. The reduced parameter search space and linear information propagation in the simplified GNN enable the IGT to be applied in large-scale industrial scenarios. Experiments on real-world logistics datasets show that our proposed model can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art methods on estimation of delivery time.

MM-KTD: Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Differences for Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: activation functions state space models neural networks interaction*\n\n*Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Parvin Malekzadeh, Akbar Assa, Arash Mohammadi, Mohammad Salimibeni*\n\n**Abstract:** There has been an increasing surge of interest on development of advanced Reinforcement Learning (RL) systems as intelligent approaches to learn optimal control policies directly from smart agents' interactions with the environment. Objectives: In a model-free RL method with continuous state-space, typically, the value function of the states needs to be approximated. In this regard, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) provide an attractive modeling mechanism to approximate the value function using sample transitions. DNN-based solutions, however, suffer from high sensitivity to parameter selection, are prone to overfitting, and are not very sample efficient. A Kalman-based methodology, on the other hand, could be used as an efficient alternative. Such an approach, however, commonly requires a-priori information about the system (such as noise statistics) to perform efficiently. The main objective of this paper is to address this issue. Methods: As a remedy to the aforementioned problems, this paper proposes an innovative Multiple Model Kalman Temporal Difference (MM-KTD) framework, which adapts the parameters of the filter using the observed states and rewards. Moreover, an active learning method is proposed to enhance the sampling efficiency of the system. More specifically, the estimated uncertainty of the value functions are exploited to form the behaviour policy leading to more visits to less certain values, therefore, improving the overall learning sample efficiency. As a result, the proposed MM-KTD framework can learn the optimal policy with significantly reduced number of samples as compared to its DNN-based counterparts. Results: To evaluate performance of the proposed MM-KTD framework, we have performed a comprehensive set of experiments based on three RL benchmarks. Experimental results show superiority of the MM-KTD framework in comparison to its state-of-the-art counterparts.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state space models (SSMs) and activation functions, here are some key points and references that address the interaction between activation functions and SSMs, their impact, design considerations, empirical studies, and theoretical analysis:\n\n## Interaction Between Activation Functions and State Space Models\n\n- The paper on \"Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners\" provides insights into how SSMs can be designed with specific activation functions. It discusses the use of gated linear units (GLUs) in conjunction with SSMs, where the state-dependent linear projection and non-linear activation functions are crucial for sequence modeling. The GLU is used to process the state \\(St\\) and input \\(xt\\) to produce the output token at the next layer.\n\n## Impact of Different Activation Functions on SSM Performance\n\n- The Longhorn paper also touches on the impact of different activation functions by framing the SSM design as an online learning problem. It suggests that the choice of activation functions and the state transition dynamics can significantly affect the performance of SSMs. For instance, the use of a gated linear unit (GLU) allows for selective propagation or forgetting of information, which can enhance the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies.\n\n## Design Considerations for Combining Activation Functions with SSMs\n\n- The design of SSMs with activation functions involves optimizing the state transition dynamics to reflect specific online learning objectives. This can include selecting the right functions for \\(A_t\\) and \\(B_t\\) in the SSM recurrence relation, which can be derived from solving an online regression problem. This approach ensures that the model can achieve superior performance with fewer parameters or reduced computational costs.\n\n## Empirical Studies Comparing Different Activation Functions in SSMs\n\n- While the provided sources do not offer direct empirical comparisons of different activation functions within SSMs, the concept of treating SSMs as online learners suggests that empirical studies could focus on comparing the performance of SSMs with various activation functions (e.g., GLU, ReLU, sigmoid) in terms of sequence modeling tasks. This would involve evaluating metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Activation Function Effects on SSM Behavior\n\n- Theoretical analysis can be drawn from the perspective of online learning and control theory. For example, the paper on \"Longhorn\" provides a theoretical framework where the recurrent update of SSMs is viewed as either a gradient descent step or a closed-form solution to an online learning objective. This framework can be extended to analyze how different activation functions influence the state transition dynamics and overall performance of SSMs.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Nonlinear Dynamics**: Incorporating nonlinear activation functions, such as those discussed in the context of neural population dynamics, can enhance the accuracy of SSMs in modeling complex sequences. Nonlinear functions like sigmoid or sine linear units (SLU) can introduce more expressive power into the model.\n\n- **Control and Optimization**: Theoretical work on controlling recurrent neural networks, such as the study on constant inputs for Hopfield-type systems, can provide insights into optimizing the behavior of SSMs with specific activation functions. This involves formulating and solving control synthesis problems to ensure the desired state trajectory.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more effective autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of state space models and carefully chosen activation functions to improve performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

The standard SwiGluMLP GAU focuses on local transformations and lacks mechanisms to maintain or process information over extended sequences. This limitation hinders the model's ability to leverage context over long spans, affecting performance on tasks requiring long-term dependency modeling.\n\nIntegrating Structured State-Space Models (SSMs), particularly Gated State Spaces (GSS), into the MLP layer presents an opportunity to enhance the model's capacity for capturing long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency. By combining the strengths of SSMs with the SwiGLU activation function, we aim to create an MLP GAU capable of dynamic information flow control and efficient sequence modeling.\n\n## Related Work\n\n**Structured State-Space Models (SSMs):** SSMs have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling long sequences with linear computational complexity. Variants like S4 and S4D offer efficient implementations suitable for integration into neural network architectures.\n\n**Gated State Spaces (GSS):** GSS introduces gating mechanisms to SSMs, allowing dynamic control over information flow. This enhances the model's ability to focus on relevant sequence parts, improving long-range dependency modeling and training efficiency.\n\n**SwiGLU Activation Function:** The SwiGLU activation function has been shown to improve the capacity and performance of Transformer models by introducing non-linearities conducive to better feature representations.\n\nIntegration of SSMs into MLP layers has been explored in works like \"Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\" (Mehta et al., 2022) and \"Incorporating Exponential Smoothing into MLP\" (Chu & Lin, 2024). These studies have informed our design by highlighting the benefits of combining SSMs with gating mechanisms within MLP components.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges with SwiGluMLP\n\n1. **Limited Long-Range Dependency Modeling:**\n   - SwiGluMLP primarily focuses on local transformations without mechanisms to maintain information over long sequences.\n   - This limits the model's ability to capture dependencies across distant tokens.\n\n2. **Inefficient Information Flow:**\n   - Lack of dynamic gating mechanisms restricts the control over information passing through the MLP layers.\n   - All inputs are processed uniformly, potentially diluting important contextual information.\n\n3. **Computational Overhead:**\n   - Standard MLP layers may not efficiently handle long sequences due to increased computation with sequence length.\n\n### Proposed Solution\n\nIntegrate Gated Structured State-Space Models into the SwiGluMLP GAU to address the above challenges:\n\n- **Enhance Long-Range Dependency Modeling:**\n  - Introduce SSMs to maintain state information across time steps within the MLP layer.\n  - Enable the model to capture both local and global patterns.\n\n- **Dynamic Information Flow Control:**\n  - Incorporate gating mechanisms to allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the sequence dynamically.\n  - Improve training efficiency by reducing interference from irrelevant information.\n\n- **Maintain Computational Efficiency:**\n  - Utilize simplified SSMs (e.g., S4D) to keep computational overhead minimal.\n  - Ensure the integration does not significantly increase resource requirements.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nAn SSM can be represented as:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{t+1} &= A x_t + B u_t \\\\\ny_t &= C x_t + D u_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( x_t \\) is the state vector at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( u_t \\) is the input at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( y_t \\) is the output at time \\( t \\).\n- \\( A, B, C, D \\) are learned parameters.\n\nBy integrating this into the MLP layer with gating, we can model dependencies over extended contexts.\n\nGating mechanism:\n\n\\[\n\\text{Gated Output} = \\sigma(W_g u_t) \\odot \\text{SSM}(u_t)\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function.\n- \\( W_g \\) is a learnable parameter matrix.\n- \\( \\odot \\) denotes element-wise multiplication.\n- \\( \\text{SSM}(u_t) \\) represents the output of the SSM given input \\( u_t \\).\n\nThis allows dynamic control over the information flow based on the input.\n\n### Trade-offs Addressed\n\n- **Complexity vs. Performance:**\n  - Potential increase in architectural complexity is mitigated by using simplified SSMs.\n  - Training stability is addressed through proper initialization and parameterization strategies from the literature.\n\n- **Integration Challenges:**\n  - Compatibility with existing activation functions and normalization layers is ensured by careful design.\n  - The modifications are localized to the SwiGluMLP GAU, minimizing impact on other components.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection SwiGluMLP```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\n1. **Integrate Gated SSM into SwiGluMLP:**\n   - Replace or augment the existing feedforward layers with SSM components.\n   - Implement gating mechanisms to control information flow dynamically.\n\n2. **Ensure Compatibility with SwiGLU Activation:**\n   - Maintain the use of the SwiGLU activation function for non-linear transformations.\n   - Ensure outputs from the SSM components are appropriately scaled and activated.\n\n3. **Maintain Computational Efficiency:**\n   - Use simplified SSMs like S4D to reduce computational overhead.\n   - Avoid significant increases in parameter count or resource requirements.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Architecture of SwiGLU-SSM\n\nThe modified SwiGluMLP GAU, named **SwiGLU-SSM**, consists of the following components:\n\n- **Input Projection Layer:**\n  - Linear transformation of input \\( X \\) to match the state dimension.\n\n- **State-Space Model Layer:**\n  - Implements a simplified SSM (e.g., S4D) to maintain and update the state across time steps.\n  - Captures long-range dependencies.\n\n- **Gating Mechanism:**\n  - Uses a sigmoid activation to generate gates based on the input.\n  - Allows dynamic control over the contributions of the SSM and input.\n\n- **SwiGLU Activation Function:**\n  - Applied after the gated SSM output.\n  - Introduces non-linearity and enhances feature representation.\n\n- **Output Projection Layer:**\n  - Maps the activated output back to the original embedding dimension.\n\n#### 2. Mathematical Formulation\n\nLet \\( X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) be the input, where \\( B \\) is batch size, \\( L \\) is sequence length, and \\( D \\) is embedding dimension.\n\n- **Input Projection:**\n\n  \\[\n  U = W_{\\text{in}} X + b_{\\text{in}}\n  \\]\n\n- **State-Space Model:**\n\n  Initialize state \\( h_0 = 0 \\).\n\n  For \\( t = 1 \\) to \\( L \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\begin{aligned}\n  h_t &= A h_{t-1} + B U_t \\\\\n  S_t &= C h_t + D U_t\n  \\end{aligned}\n  \\]\n\n  Where:\n  - \\( A, B, C, D \\) are learned parameters.\n  - \\( U_t \\) is the input at time step \\( t \\).\n\n- **Gating Mechanism:**\n\n  \\[\n  G_t = \\sigma(W_g U_t + b_g)\n  \\]\n\n  - \\( G_t \\in [0, 1] \\) controls the flow of information.\n\n- **Combine with SwiGLU Activation:**\n\n  \\[\n  Y_t = \\text{SwiGLU}(G_t \\odot S_t)\n  \\]\n\n  - \\( \\text{SwiGLU}(z) = \\text{SwiGLU Activation}(z) \\)\n\n- **Output Projection:**\n\n  \\[\n  Z_t = W_{\\text{out}} Y_t + b_{\\text{out}}\n  \\]\n\n#### 3. Theoretical Justification\n\n- **Enhanced Long-Range Dependency Modeling:**\n  - The SSM maintains a state \\( h_t \\) that captures information across time steps.\n  - This allows the model to utilize information from earlier in the sequence efficiently.\n\n- **Dynamic Information Flow:**\n  - The gating mechanism \\( G_t \\) enables the model to modulate the influence of the SSM output based on the current input.\n  - This dynamic control helps focus on relevant information and reduces noise from irrelevant parts.\n\n- **Compatibility with SwiGLU Activation:**\n  - SwiGLU activation function enhances non-linear transformations and feature representation.\n  - Combining the gated SSM output with SwiGLU allows for rich and expressive representations.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:**\n  - Using simplified SSMs ensures that the computational complexity remains manageable.\n  - Linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length is maintained.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for SwiGLU-SSM\n\n```python\nclass SwiGLUSSM(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, ssm_state_dim=None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        self.ssm_state_dim = ssm_state_dim or embed_dim  # State dimension can be set separately\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n\n        # Input Projection\n        self.W_in = nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # SSM Parameters\n        self.A = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_state_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.B = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_state_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.C = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_state_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.D = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.ssm_state_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n\n        # Gating Mechanism\n        self.W_g = nn.Linear(self.ssm_state_dim, self.ssm_state_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # SwiGLU Activation\n        self.activation_fn = nn.SiLU()\n\n        # Output Projection\n        self.W_out = nn.Linear(self.ssm_state_dim, embed_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        B, L, D = X.shape\n        U = self.W_in(X)  # Input Projection\n\n        # Initialize state h_0\n        h_t = torch.zeros(B, self.ssm_state_dim, device=X.device, dtype=X.dtype)\n\n        outputs = []\n\n        for t in range(L):\n            U_t = U[:, t, :]  # Input at time t\n\n            # State Update\n            h_t = torch.matmul(h_t, self.A.T) + torch.matmul(U_t, self.B.T)\n\n            # SSM Output\n            S_t = torch.matmul(h_t, self.C.T) + torch.matmul(U_t, self.D.T)\n\n            # Gating Mechanism\n            G_t = torch.sigmoid(self.W_g(U_t))\n\n            # SwiGLU Activation with Gated SSM Output\n            Y_t = self.activation_fn(G_t * S_t)\n\n            outputs.append(Y_t)\n\n        Y = torch.stack(outputs, dim=1)  # Shape: (B, L, ssm_state_dim)\n\n        # Output Projection\n        Z = self.W_out(Y)  # Shape: (B, L, embed_dim)\n\n        return Z, Z  # Updated intermediate variables can be returned as needed\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Replace SwiGluMLP with SwiGLUSSM:**\n   - In the TTT GAU, replace the instance of `SwiGluMLP` with `SwiGLUSSM`.\n\n2. **Initialize Parameters:**\n   - Ensure proper initialization of the SSM parameters \\( A, B, C, D \\) using strategies from the literature (e.g., initializing \\( A \\) with eigenvalues close to 1 for stability).\n\n3. **Modify the Forward Pass:**\n   - Implement the forward method as per the pseudo-code, ensuring compatibility with the existing architecture.\n\n4. **Maintain Compatibility:**\n   - Ensure that input and output dimensions match those expected by other GAUs.\n   - Verify that the modified GAU integrates seamlessly within the model's computation graph.\n\n5. **Testing and Validation:**\n   - Perform unit tests to validate the functionality of the SwiGLUSSM GAU.\n   - Compare the outputs with those of the original SwiGluMLP to ensure correctness.\n\n### Mathematical Formulas Necessary for Implementation\n\n- **State Update Equation:**\n\n  \\[\n  h_t = A h_{t-1} + B U_t\n  \\]\n\n- **SSM Output Equation:**\n\n  \\[\n  S_t = C h_t + D U_t\n  \\]\n\n- **Gating Mechanism:**\n\n  \\[\n  G_t = \\sigma(W_g U_t + b_g)\n  \\]\n\n- **SwiGLU Activation:**\n\n  \\[\n  Y_t = \\text{SwiGLU}(G_t \\odot S_t) = \\text{SiLU}(G_t \\odot S_t) \\times (G_t \\odot S_t)\n  \\]\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating Gated Structured State-Space Models into the SwiGluMLP GAU, the proposed SwiGLU-SSM aims to enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency.
