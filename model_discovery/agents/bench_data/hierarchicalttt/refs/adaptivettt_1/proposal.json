Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Franz A.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Score: 0.09)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying (Avg. Score: 0.06)\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference.

In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py). We open-sourced the code of our implementation and most of the evaluation as a colab to help others reproduce the results: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/memory_efficient_attention. ### 5.1 Inference\n\nIn Table 2 we compare the memory requirements and the compute time of the memory-efficient attention implementation and the Flax implementation of attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: test-time training meta-learning attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. M-L2O: Towards Generalizable Learning-to-Optimize by Test-Time Fast Self-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning attention*\n\n*Junjie Yang, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps, by proposing a proposed framework (termed as M-L2O).\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting\"specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Grewe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work study principled ways to tackle the CL problem by adopting a Bayesian perspective and focus on continually learning a task-specific posterior distribution via a shared meta-model, atask-conditioned hypernetwork, in sharp contrast to most Bayesian CL approaches that focus on the recursive update of a single posterior distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Learning (CL) algorithms have recently received a lot of attention as they attempt to overcome the need to train with an i.i.d. sample from some unknown target data distribution. Building on prior work, we study principled ways to tackle the CL problem by adopting a Bayesian perspective and focus on continually learning a task-specific posterior distribution via a shared meta-model, a task-conditioned hypernetwork. This approach, which we term Posterior-replay CL, is in sharp contrast to most Bayesian CL approaches that focus on the recursive update of a single posterior distribution. The benefits of our approach are (1) an increased flexibility to model solutions in weight space and therewith less susceptibility to task dissimilarity, (2) access to principled task-specific predictive uncertainty estimates, that can be used to infer task identity during test time and to detect task boundaries during training, and (3) the ability to revisit and update task-specific posteriors in a principled manner without requiring access to past data. The proposed framework is versatile, which we demonstrate using simple posterior approximations (such as Gaussians) as well as powerful, implicit distributions modelled via a neural network. We illustrate the conceptual advance of our framework on low-dimensional problems and show performance gains on computer vision benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 49  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4. OST: Improving Generalization of DeepFake Detection via One-Shot Test-Time Training\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning attention*\n\n*Liang Chen, Yong Zhang, Yibing Song, Jue Wang, Lingqiao Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new learning paradigm specially designed for the generalizable deepfake detection task is introduced, which synthesizes pseudo-training samples from each test image and creates a test-time training objective to update the model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art deepfake detectors perform well in identifying forgeries when they are evaluated on a test set similar to the training set, but struggle to maintain good performance when the test forgeries exhibit different characteristics from the training images, e.g., forgeries are created by unseen deepfake methods. Such a weak generalization capability hinders the applicability of current deepfake detectors. In this paper, we introduce a new learning paradigm specially designed for the generalizable deepfake detection task. Our key idea is to construct a testsample-specific auxiliary task to update the model before applying it to the sample. Specifically, we synthesize pseudo-training samples from each test image and create a test-time training objective to update the model. Moreover, we propose to leverage meta-learning to ensure that a fast single-step test-time gradient descent, dubbed one-shot test-time training (OST), can be sufficient for good deepfake detection performance. Extensive results across several benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach performs favorably against existing arts in terms of generalization to unseen data and robustness to different post-processing steps.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 48  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 5.

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning attention*\n\n*Eric Xing, Pengtao Xie, Willie Neiswanger, Sang Keun Choe*\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

A Meta-Learning Framework for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning attention*\n\n*Vinay Kumar Verma, Dhanajit Brahma, Piyush Rai*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to classify unseen class samples at test time is popularly referred to as zero-shot learning (ZSL). If test samples can be from training (seen) as well as unseen classes, it is a more challenging problem due to the existence of strong bias towards seen classes. This problem is generally known as \\emph{generalized} zero-shot learning (GZSL). Thanks to the recent advances in generative models such as VAEs and GANs, sample synthesis based approaches have gained considerable attention for solving this problem. These approaches are able to handle the problem of class bias by synthesizing unseen class samples. However, these ZSL/GZSL models suffer due to the following key limitations: $(i)$ Their training stage learns a class-conditioned generator using only \\emph{seen} class data and the training stage does not \\emph{explicitly} learn to generate the unseen class samples; $(ii)$ They do not learn a generic optimal parameter which can easily generalize for both seen and unseen class generation; and $(iii)$ If we only have access to a very few samples per seen class, these models tend to perform poorly. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning based generative model that naturally handles these limitations. The proposed model is based on integrating model-agnostic meta learning with a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to handle $(i)$ and $(iii)$, and uses a novel task distribution to handle $(ii)$. Our proposed model yields significant improvements on standard ZSL as well as more challenging GZSL setting. In ZSL setting, our model yields 4.5\\%, 6.0\\%, 9.8\\%, and 27.9\\% relative improvements over the current state-of-the-art on CUB, AWA1, AWA2, and aPY datasets, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Revisiting Local Descriptor for Improved Few-Shot Classification\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning attention*\n\n*Qianru Sun, Mingliang Xu, Xueliang Liu, Richang Hong, Jun He*\n\n**Abstract:** Few-shot classification studies the problem of quickly adapting a deep learner to understanding novel classes based on few support images. In this context, recent research efforts have been aimed at designing more and more complex classifiers that measure similarities between query and support images, but left the importance of feature embeddings seldom explored. We show that the reliance on sophisticated classifiers is not necessary, and a simple classifier applied directly to improved feature embeddings can instead outperform most of the leading methods in the literature. To this end, we present a new method named \\textbf{DCAP} for few-shot classification, in which we investigate how one can improve the quality of embeddings by leveraging \\textbf{D}ense \\textbf{C}lassification and \\textbf{A}ttentive \\textbf{P}ooling. Specifically, we propose to train a learner on base classes with abundant samples to solve dense classification problem first and then meta-train the learner on a bunch of randomly sampled few-shot tasks to adapt it to few-shot scenario or the test time scenario. During meta-training, we suggest to pool feature maps by applying attentive pooling instead of the widely used global average pooling (GAP) to prepare embeddings for few-shot classification. Attentive pooling learns to reweight local descriptors, explaining what the learner is looking for as evidence for decision making. Experiments on two benchmark datasets show the proposed method to be superior in multiple few-shot settings while being simpler and more explainable.

For instance, **CASAK-V** introduces dynamic sparse attention that adapts to the input context, reducing memory usage by 40% and achieving near-linear runtime complexity compared to full attention mechanisms.\n\n### FlashAttention and FlashMask\n**FlashAttention** uses a tiling technique to divide large matrices into smaller blocks, reducing memory usage and computational complexity. This approach can be further enhanced with **FlashMask**, which adds a masking capability to selectively focus on certain parts of the input, maintaining efficiency and speed advantages.\n\n### Block-Attention\n**Block-Attention** is another efficient mechanism designed for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models. It processes input sequences in blocks, reducing Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) by 48% and Floating Point Operations To First Token (FLOPs-TFT) by 90.1% compared to self-attention models. This mechanism shows comparable or even better performance after fine-tuning.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Test-Time Training and Meta-Learning\n\n### Combining Test-Time Training with Meta-Learning\nIntegrating test-time training capabilities, such as those in **FastTTTLinear**, with meta-learning approaches, like **AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA)** in GPT-2, can enhance the model's adaptability. This combination allows the model to dynamically adjust weights during test-time, leveraging the expressive hidden states and context-adaptive encoding[Parent Analysis Summary].\n\n### Dynamic Sparse Attention with Meta-Learning\n**CASAK-V** uses a meta-learning framework to fine-tune a compact pre-trained transformer for sparse pattern identification. This dynamic approach can be integrated with test-time training to adapt the sparse attention patterns based on the input context, enhancing both efficiency and adaptability.\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Different Adaptation Approaches\n\n### Efficiency and Performance Trade-offs\n- **Block-Attention** shows that it can achieve similar or better performance than self-attention models while significantly reducing computational and memory overhead. This is particularly evident in RAG scenarios where the semantics of each retrieved passage are mutually independent.\n- **CASAK-V** demonstrates minimal performance degradation on long-context benchmarks while reducing memory usage and achieving near-linear runtime complexity. This highlights the effectiveness of dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression.\n\n### Adaptation Mechanisms\n- **FastTTTLinear** and **ALA** have different strengths and limitations. **FastTTTLinear** offers linear complexity and hardware-efficient training but may have complex integration and potential overhead from test-time updates. **ALA** provides efficient scaling and dynamic adaptation but comes with computational overhead from meta-learning. Combining these approaches can leverage their complementary strengths[Parent Analysis Summary].\n\n### Optimization Techniques\n- Using **memristor-based in-memory computing** can further optimize the attention mechanisms by integrating computation into memory, reducing the need for data transfer and thus improving efficiency.\n- **Tiling and recomputation techniques**, as seen in **FlashAttention**, can be applied to other attention mechanisms to minimize memory footprint and speed up computations.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of memory and computation but also highly adaptable and performant across various tasks. The key is to balance complexity with performance, leveraging the strengths of different attention mechanisms and adaptation approaches.\n",

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Score: 0.09)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/41 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nThe idea is that we can compute step $t$ based on the results from step $t-1$ instead of starting from scratch. Algorithm 2 illustrates the algorithm, where highlighted lines are the main difference from Algorithm 1. We introduce two min-heaps (and maintain the sum of elements for each heap) for tracking the search progress of $(u, w)$ and achieving $O(1)$ evaluation of line 9 in Algorithm 2. Note that each insertion into a min-heap costs logarithmic time in the heap size and each $z_{t}$ introduces at most two more possible ( $u, w$ ) pairs (lines 2-6 in Algorithm 2). Therefore, executing Algorithm 2 over $m$ incremental sets (i.e., $m$ steps) costs $O(m \\log m)$ in total. As Peters et al. [54] have noted, the solution $\\boldsymbol{p}^{*}$ tends to contain only a few nonzeros, leading to small $u^{*}$ and $w^{*}$. Therefore, in practice, we can use partial sort on the $k^{\\prime}=O(k)$ largest values instead of full sort in Algorithm 1, thereby achieving a complexity of $O(m \\log k)$. With respect to Algorithm 2, this change is equivalent to restricting the size of the min-heap $\\mathcal{S}$ to an upper bound for achieving the same reduction in complexity. ### 3.4 Extensions\n\nTraining with fixed-size truncation-free cache Our selection method enables training on extremely long documents that need to be segmented into smaller chunks for recurrent processing. Algorithm 3 illustrates the process. Without introducing any additional truncation strategies or parameters, the algorithm maintains a fixed-size cache benefit by recurrent calculations and produces exactly the same results as calculating without chunking, which is guaranteed by the irreversibility of our selection method. To minimize the memory footprint, we stop the gradients of the cache, thereby pruning the computation graph, as in Transformer-XL [17]. With this algorithm, we can extend the training context length to hundreds of thousands of tokens. Combine with other efficient attention mechanism Our SPARSEK attention can be combined with other sparse attention as long as they have irreversible selection patterns. In this work, we integrate SPARSEK attention with sliding window (SW) attention by default, motivated by the well-known experience that sliding windows are simple yet incredibly strong for language modeling [58, 37]. Specifically, given a sliding window size $w$, we replace $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}$ in (5) with\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{K} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{K}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{V} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{V}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis combination does not introduce any overhead thanks to our fused Triton kernel. In this combination, SPARSEK attention attention aims at efficiently global (long-range) dependencies modeling, while SW attention is used for modeling local dependencies. Besides, SPARSEK attention can also be combined with linear attention methods, which hypothesize the existence of low-rank structures in attention scores rather than sparsity. From a theoretical perspective, Chen et al. [10] reveal that linear attention and sparse attention capture different attention patterns, and their combination provides a closer approximation to full attention. In this work, we extend their results to SparseK attention and recent attention optimizations [19]. For technical details, please refer to Appendix B.1. Straight-through estimator From TOPK to SpArseK, we employ relaxation techniques to facilitate gradient-based training. Alternatively, the straight-through estimator (ST) [5] can be utilized, i.e., $\\Delta^{\\text {st }}=\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}-\\operatorname{stop} \\_\\operatorname{grad}\\left(\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}\\right)+\\Delta^{\\text {hard }}$, allowing the model to perform true selection. By utilizing the ST method, the model achieves slightly improved efficiency since it bypasses the multiplication of selection scores during the forward pass. Our experimental results indicate that employing ST results in negligible performance degradation. Consequently, this technique shows promise in balancing performance and computational efficiency. ### 3.5 Techniques for Faster and More Stable Training\n\nWe introduce three beneficial modeling tricks discovered in our experiments.

Prior work shows that attention excels at recall, the ability to ground generations in previously seen tokens [1, 3]. On the other hand, the throughput of attention-based models is bottle-necked during training by quadratic compute complexity and during inference by aggressive memory consumption. The natural question is: can we improve the real-world speed and memory-use of language models without comprising on quality? Recently, a number of architectures have been proposed that enable substantially higher throughput while matching attention in perplexity [4, 5, 6, 7, 8. However, coarse metrics like overall perplexity can obscure important differences in model quality. For example, recent work shows that a specific class of architectures, gated-convolutions, despite complexity scaling sub-quadratically in sequence length, are less efficient than\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-02.jpg?height=420&width=1620&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=247)\n\nFigure 1: Based overview. Combining linear attention with tiny sliding window softmax attention (e.g., 64 or 128 tokens in width) enables improved recall accuracy with limited efficiency overhead vs. smaller tile sizes.

(Center) Model recall accuracy ( $y$ ) vs. sliding window attention size $(x)$. We compare linear attention alone (dark blue), sliding window attention alone (light blue), and their combination (BASED, orange). (Right) Schematic diagram of BASED illustrating how the two components complement each other. attention at performing recall 1]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broader class of architectures across real-world recall-intensive tasks and show attention improves over the best attention-free alternative, Mamba, by 46.7 accuracy points (Table 1). ${ }^{1}$\n\nMotivated by these observations, we explore the pareto frontier of the tradeoff between high-recall and high-throughput models. We evaluate a range of architectures (e.g. attention, SSMs, and convolutions) on a popular synthetic associative recall task [1, 3, 9, Since generation throughput is bottle-necked by memory consumption, we vary hyperparameters (e.g. model dimension) that affect the size of the recurrent state during generation and demonstrate a fundamental recall-memory tradeoff that holds across architecture classes (Figure 2). Attention performs associative recall perfectly, but the recurrent state (i.e. the KV-cache) grows linearly with the sequence length. Sliding window attention can cap the size of the recurrent state at the cost of worse long-range recall 10 . However, Mamba, a recently proposed SSM architecture expands the Pareto frontier beyond sliding window. This begs the question: are there other, perhaps simpler, models that can also expand the pareto frontier? To reduce the memory consumption, we consider using two simple techniques: sliding window attention and softmax-approximating linear attention. Our results on language modeling (Table 1) and synthetic recall experiments (Figure 1, center) suggest neither primitive alone suffices to navigate the Pareto frontier. 1. We find that linear attention alone struggles to solve associative recall (Figure 1, center). We hypothesize that this is because linear attention lacks the precision to perform local token shifts and comparisons [1, 9. 2. In sliding window attention, associative recall range is limited by the width of the windows (Figure 1, center). As we increase the window size, the recurrent state grows linearly and has a non-linear affect on speed during parallel training and inference (Figure 1 , left). We combine these two techniques into a single architecture, which we call BASED (Figure 1, right). We find that sliding window attention and linear attention complement each other, enabling BASED to expand the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff (Figure 22. We suspect that (1) the large recurrent memory of linear attention could help model long-range token interactions in the sequence and (2) sliding window attention handles the precise local shifts needed to perform associative recall. To make BASED competitive with SoTA attention 11] and recurrent [5 models under wall-clock and throughput metrics, we introduce several IO-aware optimizations. 1. Despite the theoretically improved complexity, linear attention implementations are often slower than well-optimized attention implementations 12 . In BASED, we use the 2nd-order Taylor approximation of softmax as the linear attention feature map With sequence length $N$ and head dimension $d$, this\n\n[^1]na\u00efvely requires $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ time and space complexity [13, 14].\n```\n\n#### 5. HiPPO: Recurrent Memory with Optimal Polynomial Projections (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, C.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient adaptation mechanisms memory optimization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptation mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptation mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline.

FlexLLM: A System for Co-Serving Large Language Model Inference and Parameter-Efficient Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptation mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Zhihao Jia, Colin Unger, Mengdi Wu, Xinhao Cheng, Gabriele Oliaro, Xupeng Miao*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) is a widely used technique to adapt large language models for different tasks. Service providers typically create separate systems for users to perform PEFT model finetuning and inference tasks. This is because existing systems cannot handle workloads that include a mix of inference and PEFT finetuning requests. As a result, shared GPU resources are underutilized, leading to inefficiencies. To address this problem, we present FlexLLM, the first system that can serve inference and parameter-efficient finetuning requests in the same iteration. Our system leverages the complementary nature of these two tasks and utilizes shared GPU resources to run them jointly, using a method called co-serving. To achieve this, FlexLLM introduces a novel token-level finetuning mechanism, which breaks down the finetuning computation of a sequence into smaller token-level computations and uses dependent parallelization and graph pruning, two static compilation optimizations, to minimize the memory overhead and latency for co-serving. Compared to existing systems, FlexLLM's co-serving approach reduces the activation GPU memory overhead by up to 8x, and the end-to-end GPU memory requirement of finetuning by up to 36% while maintaining a low inference latency and improving finetuning throughput. For example, under a heavy inference workload, FlexLLM can still preserve more than 80% of the peak finetuning throughput, whereas existing systems cannot make any progress with finetuning.

Recursive Least-Squares Estimator-Aided Online Learning for Visual Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptation mechanisms memory optimization*\n\n*Weiming Hu, Shan Yu, Liang Li, Bing Li, Yutong Kou, Xiaojuan Qi, Yan Lu, Jin Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Tracking visual objects from a single initial exemplar in the testing phase has been broadly cast as a one-/few-shot problem, i.e., one-shot learning for initial adaptation and few-shot learning for online adaptation. The recent few-shot online adaptation methods incorporate the prior knowledge from large amounts of annotated training data via complex meta-learning optimization in the offline phase. This helps the online deep trackers to achieve fast adaptation and reduce overfitting risk in tracking. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective recursive least-squares estimator-aided online learning approach for few-shot online adaptation without requiring offline training. It allows an in-built memory retention mechanism for the model to remember the knowledge about the object seen before, and thus the seen data can be safely removed from training. This also bears certain similarities to the emerging continual learning field in preventing catastrophic forgetting. This mechanism enables us to unveil the power of modern online deep trackers without incurring too much extra computational cost. We evaluate our approach based on two networks in the online learning families for tracking, i.e., multi-layer perceptrons in RT-MDNet and convolutional neural networks in DiMP.

Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/51 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nThis trend is highlighted in Figure 19 (in Appendix). We leave further investigation of this trend to future work. The left panel of Figure 2 is a zoomed-in view of Figure 13. For clarity, we leave TF pretrain out of Figure 2 and only show TF finetune (labeled as Transformer) since it is the stronger baseline. Figure 14 reproduces the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP and additional discussion. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-16.jpg?height=478&width=747&top_left_y=1886&top_left_x=342)\n\nFigure 14. Reproduction of the right panel of Figure 2, now with TTT-MLP. Comparing to TTT-Linear, TTT-MLP performs slightly worse at short context but better at long context. This observation matches our expectation that the MLP as hidden state is more expressive than the linear model. Again, all methods have matched training FLOPs as Mamba 1.4B. For TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, this protocol implies matched inference FLOPs. Transformer (TF finetune) has $2.8 \\times$ the inference FLOPs, giving it an advantage as our baseline. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_1d28964b3a79d5da6317g-17.jpg?height=408&width=1409&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=357)\n\nFigure 15. Benchmark on an NVIDIA A100 GPU with 80G HBM and PCIe connections. Left: Same as Figure 3, but now with TTT-MLP. Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster then that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. Right: For generate (decode), TTT-Linear and Mamba have almost the same latency, which is significantly smaller than that of Transformer and TTT-MLP. ### 3.3 Wall-clock time\n\nLLM training and inference can be decomposed into forward, backward, and generate. Prompt processing during inference, also known as prefill, is the same operation as forward during training, except that the intermediate activations do not need to be stored for backward. Since both forward (during training and inference) and backward can be parallelized, we use the dual form. Generating new tokens, also known as decode, is inherently sequential, so we use the primal form. Due to resource constraints, our experiments are written in JAX and run on TPUs. On a v5e-256 TPU pod, the Transformer baseline takes 0.30 s per iteration of training at context 2 k , while TTT-Linear takes 0.27 s per iteration, already $10 \\%$ faster without any systems optimization. However, Mamba (implemented in PyTorch, Triton, and CUDA) can only run on GPUs, so for fair comparison, we also rewrite our method with preliminary systems optimization to run on GPUs. Specifically, we write a GPU kernel for forward in ThunderKittens [66]. Historically, RNNs have been inefficient during forward and backward due to poor use of parallelism and matmuls. Our goal with the forward kernel is to demonstrate the effectiveness of mini-batch TTT and the dual form for these problems. A kernel for backward should have the same properties in efficiency as forward, but requires more complex logic for manual differentiation, therefore is left for future work. The left panel of Figure 15 shows the latency for batch size 16 of our forward kernel. All models are 1.3B (1.4B for Mamba). Time per token grows linearly for Transformer as context length increases, but stays roughly constant for the other methods. ${ }^{14}$ Note that our Transformer baseline is significantly faster that in the Mamba paper, because we use vLLM [46], a state-of-the-art serving system, instead of the HuggingFace Transformer [77]. In addition, we write another GPU kernel for generate in Triton [72], and benchmark its speed in the right panel of Figure 15 for batch size 512. Another popular metric for wall-clock time is throughput, which takes into account the potential benefit of being able to use a larger batch size. ${ }^{15}$ For completeness, we report the throughput for forward and generate in Figure 20 (in Appendix). All the observations and ordering between methods above still hold for throughput. [^10]\n## 4 Related Work\n\n### 4.1 Modern RNNs\n\nMamba is one of the many Structured State-Space Models [27, 21, 57, 18]. The hidden state in these models is a vector, similar to in LSTMs. For TTT-Linear or TTT-MLP, the hidden state is a matrix or two matrices, therefore larger. In Figure 14, we find that TTT layers can take advantage of their larger hidden states to compress more information in long context, where TTT-MLP outperforms TTT-Linear, which in turn outperforms Mamba. Similar to TTT-Linear, RWKV [55, 56], xLSTM [5], and Gated Linear Attention (GLA) [79] also have matrix hidden states, which are inherited from linear attention [41]. Modern RNNs such as GLA use chunk-wise parallelism to improve hardware efficiency, so tokens inside a chunk can be processed with matmuls instead of a cumsum. However, chunk-wise parallelism does not change the expressiveness of the model, since all temporal dependencies are still equivalent to a cumsum. In contrast, mini-batch TTT allows more complex temporal dependencies across mini-batches. Each hidden state $W_{t}$ depends on previous $W s$ within its mini-batch still through a cumsum, but depends on Ws in previous mini-batches also through the gradient operator. As illustrated Figure 8, mini-batch TTT enables a trade-off between expressiveness and hardware efficiency, since a smaller batch size $b$ leads to better perplexity at the cost of higher latency. This trade-off is a unique and important feature of TTT. As shown in Table 1 , the intermediate batch size $b=16$ significantly outperforms $b=T$ which is fully cumsum. ### 4.2 Learning at Test Time\n\nThe idea of learning at test time has a long history in machine learning. One of the earliest versions of this idea is called local learning (Bottou and Vapnik [10]): For each test input, train on its neighbors before making a prediction. This procedure has been effectively applied to models ranging from SVMs [81] to modern LLMs [29]. Another early version of learning at test time is called transductive learning [22]. The principle of transduction, as stated by Vladimir Vapnik [74], is to \"... get the answer that you really need, but not a more general one.\" Practical implementations of transductive learning use test data to add constraints to the margin of SVMs [39,17]. However, transductive learning usually needs multiple test instances to be empirically effective, unlike many instantiations of test-time training, which only need a test single instance (image, video, or natural language sequence) at a time. In computer vision, the idea of learning at test time has been applied for decades to applications such as face detection [38], object detection [53], image super-resolution [65], and 3D reconstruction [50]. More recently, the same idea has also been applied to natural language processing, where it is called dynamic evaluation [44, 45]. The basic approach is to directly finetune a language model on the test sequence, which often comes in the form of a prompt. Next, we discuss two relevant lines of work in detail: test-time training and fast weights. ### 4.2.1 Test-Time Training\n\nThe core idea of Test-Time Training (TTT) is that each test instance defines its own learning problem, where this test instance alone is the target of generalization [69]. Concretely, for each test instance $x$, the conventional practice is to predict $f(x)$, using a predictor $f$ that is optimized for all training instances on average. TTT first formulates a learning problem defined by $x$, then trains a model $f_{x}$ on $x$ (often with $f$ as initialization), and predicts $f_{x}(x)$. Since the test instance comes without its label, the learning problem can only be formulated with a self-supervised task. Prior work has shown that TTT with reconstruction significantly improves performance especially on outliers [23]. Improvements become even more pronounced when testing on video frames that arrive in a stream and TTT is autoregressive [76], as $f_{t}$ is trained on past frames $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t}$. The autoregressive connection makes [76] most relevant to our paper. Conceptually, the biggest difference between our paper and prior work is that our reconstruction task is learned in an outer loop, instead of handcrafted with human priors. Follow-up work to TTT has explored applications such as robot manipulation [28] and locomotion [68], among others, that often require different designs for the self-supervised task. ### 4.2.2 Fast Weights\n\nThe general idea of fast weights is to update the parameters of a \"fast\" model on only the most relevant data, as opposed to the conventional practice of updating a \"slow\" model on all data [71]. This idea has existed since the 1980s [32]. The most relevant data can be the test instance itself, therefore TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. Prior work in fast weights usually avoids forming an explicit learning problem that optimizes some objective on data. For example, the update rule of Hebbian learning and Hopfield networks [35] simply adds $x x^{T}$ (or some variant thereof) [4] to the fast weights given each input $x$. In contrast, TTT embraces the idea of formulating an explicit learning problem, where the test instance is the target of generalization. Our update rule is also an explicit step of optimization. The idea of fast weight programmers (FWPs) is to update the fast weights with a \"slow\" model [62]. Our inner-loop weights $W$ can be viewed as \"fast\" and outer-loop weights $\\theta$ as \"slow\". Therefore, networks containing TTT layers can be viewed as a special case of FWPs [43], similar to how TTT can be viewed as a special case of fast weights. The FWP with the Hebbian update rule above is equivalent to linear attention [60], therefore also to naive TTT-Linear with batch gradient descent. The definition of FWPs is very broad. In fact, all networks with some gating mechanism, such as Transformers with SwiGLU blocks [63], can also be viewed as a special case of FWPs ${ }^{16}$. Recent work has been experimenting with FWPs for language modeling: Irie et al. [37] design \"fast\" networks with weights produced as output of a \"slow\" networks. Clark et al. [16] give a Transformer a final layer of fast weights, whose initialization is trained as slow weights. Our contribution relative to existing work on FWPs, again, is formulating an explicit learning problem for the update, which enables us to borrow tools from learning such as mini-batch and LN. ### 4.3 Learning to Learn\n\nFor decades, researchers have been arguing that learning to learn, also known as meta-learning or bi-level optimization, should be a critical component of intelligence [61, 6, 70, 47]. In prior work such as [2], [20] and [52], the inner loop learns from an entire dataset at a time instead of a sequence, so the outer loop needs a collection of datasets or tasks. In short, the outer loop is \"one level above\" regular training. Since it is hard to collect millions of datasets, this outer loop is hard to scale. In contrast, for TTT, each sequence itself is a dataset and defines its own generalization problem. The inner loop is \"one level below\" regular training, so our outer loop is only another solution to the canonical problem of supervised learning, instead of a new problem setting like generalization across datasets. As illustrated in Table 2, our outer loop is \"at the same level\" as regular training. This makes our outer loop easier to scale. [^11]|  | Inner loop | Outer loop | Subsection |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Piece of data | Token $x_{t}$ | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ |  |\n| Training set | Sequence $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{T}$ | Dataset of sequences, e.g., Books | 2.2 .2 .2 |\n| Objective | Reconstruction (loss $\\ell$ ) | Next-token prediction |  |\n| Parameters | $W$ (weights of $f$ ) | $\\theta_{\\text {rest }}($ rest of the network) |  |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{K}, \\theta_{Q}, \\theta_{V}$ (reconstruction views) | 2.3 |\n|  |  | $\\theta_{\\text {init }}$ and $\\theta_{\\mathrm{lr}}$ | 2.7 |\n\nTable 2. In summary, our paper reformulates supervised learning as learning to learn, with two nested loops.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Score: 0.02)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/30 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

We note that biological agents have no option but to operate inductively, due to (a) hard memory bounds, and (b) evolutionary pressure towards minimizing inference latency: When faced with a threat, a biological agent is better served by a quick suboptimal decision than by reasoning over all past experience. AI built on silicon has no such limitations: Memory can grow unbounded and test-time computation can be distributed and improved by hardware design. Nonetheless, any practical realization involves some kind of constraint on inference time or compute resources. Therefore, resource-constrained optimal inference hinges on how to best use the available resources against a growing memory. Example A. 2 (CNN Classifiers, VAEs and GANs). A trained representation can be co-opted to generate data. For example, a CNN can be used to classify random data until one is labeled with the desired class, and the resulting sample considered as being \"generated\" by the CNN. Similarly, one could generate random data indirectly by feeding noise to an encoder, as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), again co-opting a representation for generating data. In a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), data is generated by perturbing the latent representation of a map trained to re-construct the dataset. Example A. 3 (Diffusion Models). Diffusion Models are representations, trained to re-construct the original data, but the mechanics used to reconstruct the data during training are sequential, using an artificial \"time\" variable, akin to a realization. This makes their use as \"generative representation\" natural since the reconstruction process is already a stochastic realization $8^{8}$\nExample A.\n```\n\n#### 3. Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/47 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.15180, 2020.

M-L2O: Towards Generalizable Learning-to-Optimize by Test-Time Fast Self-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Junjie Yang, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen, Zhangyang Wang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps, by proposing a proposed framework (termed as M-L2O).\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to Optimize (L2O) has drawn increasing attention as it often remarkably accelerates the optimization procedure of complex tasks by ``overfitting\"specific task type, leading to enhanced performance compared to analytical optimizers. Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

Learning Large-scale Neural Fields via Context Pruned Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Jihoon Tack, Subin Kim, Sihyun Yu, Jaeho Lee, Jinwoo Shin, Jonathan Schwarz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an efficient optimization-based meta-learning technique for large-scale neural field training by realizing significant memory savings through automated online context point selection and improves the quality of the meta-learned initialization by introducing a bootstrap correction.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce an efficient optimization-based meta-learning technique for large-scale neural field training by realizing significant memory savings through automated online context point selection. This is achieved by focusing each learning step on the subset of data with the highest expected immediate improvement in model quality, resulting in the almost instantaneous modeling of global structure and subsequent refinement of high-frequency details. We further improve the quality of our meta-learned initialization by introducing a bootstrap correction resulting in the minimization of any error introduced by reduced context sets while simultaneously mitigating the well-known myopia of optimization-based meta-learning. Finally, we show how gradient re-scaling at meta-test time allows the learning of extremely high-quality neural fields in significantly shortened optimization procedures. Our framework is model-agnostic, intuitive, straightforward to implement, and shows significant reconstruction improvements for a wide range of signals. We provide an extensive empirical evaluation on nine datasets across multiple multiple modalities, demonstrating state-of-the-art results while providing additional insight through careful analysis of the algorithmic components constituting our method.

Memory Efficient Meta-Learning with Large Images\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*J. Bronskill, Daniela Massiceti, Massimiliano Patacchiola, Katja Hofmann, Sebastian Nowozin, Richard E. Turner*\n\n**TL;DR:** LITE is proposed, a general and memory efficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks composed of large images on a single GPU and enables Meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning approaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Meta learning approaches to few-shot classification are computationally efficient at test time, requiring just a few optimization steps or single forward pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to train. This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can contain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be taken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires either parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be available, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints apply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory efficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks composed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the gradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's training images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire training set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a random subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the full gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4 parts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners. LITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning approaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving as a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you need for few-shot classification.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Meta-Learning Probabilistic Inference for Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Jonathan Gordon, J. Bronskill, M. Bauer, Sebastian Nowozin, Richard E.

Specifically: 1) We develop ML-PIP, a general framework for Meta-Learning approximate Probabilistic Inference for Prediction. ML-PIP extends existing probabilistic interpretations of meta-learning to cover a broad class of methods. 2) We introduce VERSA, an instance of the framework employing a flexible and versatile amortization network that takes few-shot learning datasets as inputs, with arbitrary numbers of shots, and outputs a distribution over task-specific parameters in a single forward pass. VERSA substitutes optimization at test time with forward passes through inference networks, amortizing the cost of inference and relieving the need for second derivatives during training. 3) We evaluate VERSA on benchmark datasets where the method sets new state-of-the-art results, handles arbitrary numbers of shots, and for classification, arbitrary numbers of classes at train and test time. The power of the approach is then demonstrated through a challenging few-shot ShapeNet view reconstruction task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 246  (*Influential: 35*)\n\n#### 5. Learning model uncertainty as variance-minimizing instance weights\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Nishant Jain, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Pradeep Shenoy*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel instance-conditional reweighting approach that captures predictive uncertainty using an auxiliary network, and unifies these train-and test-time applications, and improves upon large-scale pretrained models such as PLEX.\n\n**Abstract:** Predictive uncertainty\u2013a model\u2019s self-awareness regarding its accuracy on an input\u2013 is key for both building robust models via training interventions and for test-time applications such as selective classification. We propose a novel instance-conditional reweighting approach that captures predictive uncertainty using an auxiliary network, and unifies these train-and test-time applications. The auxiliary network is trained using a meta-objective in a bilevel optimization framework. A key contribution of our proposal is the meta-objective of minimizing dropout variance, an approximation of Bayesian predictive uncertainty, We show in controlled experiments that we effectively capture diverse specific notions of uncertainty through this meta-objective, while previous approaches only capture certain aspects.

Probable Domain Generalization via Quantile Risk Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, George J. Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Julius von K\u00fcgelgen, Shashank Singh, Alexander Robey, Cian Eastwood*\n\n**Abstract:** Domain generalization (DG) seeks predictors which perform well on unseen test distributions by leveraging data drawn from multiple related training distributions or domains. To achieve this, DG is commonly formulated as an average- or worst-case problem over the set of possible domains. However, predictors that perform well on average lack robustness while predictors that perform well in the worst case tend to be overly-conservative. To address this, we propose a new probabilistic framework for DG where the goal is to learn predictors that perform well with high probability. Our key idea is that distribution shifts seen during training should inform us of probable shifts at test time, which we realize by explicitly relating training and test domains as draws from the same underlying meta-distribution. To achieve probable DG, we propose a new optimization problem called Quantile Risk Minimization (QRM). By minimizing the $\\alpha$-quantile of predictor's risk distribution over domains, QRM seeks predictors that perform well with probability $\\alpha$. To solve QRM in practice, we propose the Empirical QRM (EQRM) algorithm and provide: (i) a generalization bound for EQRM; and (ii) the conditions under which EQRM recovers the causal predictor as $\\alpha \\to 1$. In our experiments, we introduce a more holistic quantile-focused evaluation protocol for DG and demonstrate that EQRM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on datasets from WILDS and DomainBed.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. Better by Default: Strong Pre-Tuned MLPs and Boosted Trees on Tabular Data\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Ingo Steinwart, L\u00e9o Grinsztajn, David Holzm\u00fcller*\n\n**Abstract:** For classification and regression on tabular data, the dominance of gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) has recently been challenged by often much slower deep learning methods with extensive hyperparameter tuning. We address this discrepancy by introducing (a) RealMLP, an improved multilayer perceptron (MLP), and (b) improved default parameters for GBDTs and RealMLP. We tune RealMLP and the default parameters on a meta-train benchmark with 71 classification and 47 regression datasets and compare them to hyperparameter-optimized versions on a disjoint meta-test benchmark with 48 classification and 42 regression datasets, as well as the GBDT-friendly benchmark by Grinsztajn et al. (2022). Our benchmark results show that RealMLP offers a better time-accuracy tradeoff than other neural nets and is competitive with GBDTs. Moreover, a combination of RealMLP and GBDTs with improved default parameters can achieve excellent results on medium-sized tabular datasets (1K--500K samples) without hyperparameter tuning.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. Make One-Shot Video Object Segmentation Efficient Again\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training meta-learning optimization*\n\n*Laura Leal-Taixe, Tim Meinhardt*\n\n**Abstract:** Video object segmentation (VOS) describes the task of segmenting a set of objects in each frame of a video. In the semi-supervised setting, the first mask of each object is provided at test time. Following the one-shot principle, fine-tuning VOS methods train a segmentation model separately on each given object mask. However, recently the VOS community has deemed such a test time optimization and its impact on the test runtime as unfeasible. To mitigate the inefficiencies of previous fine-tuning approaches, we present efficient One-Shot Video Object Segmentation (e-OSVOS). In contrast to most VOS approaches, e-OSVOS decouples the object detection task and predicts only local segmentation masks by applying a modified version of Mask R-CNN. The one-shot test runtime and performance are optimized without a laborious and handcrafted hyperparameter search. To this end, we meta learn the model initialization and learning rates for the test time optimization. To achieve optimal learning behavior, we predict individual learning rates at a neuron level. Furthermore, we apply an online adaptation to address the common performance degradation throughout a sequence by continuously fine-tuning the model on previous mask predictions supported by a frame-to-frame bounding box propagation. e-OSVOS provides state-of-the-art results on DAVIS 2016, DAVIS 2017, and YouTube-VOS for one-shot fine-tuning methods while reducing the test runtime substantially. Code is available at https://github.com/dvl-tum/e-osvos.\n\n**Conference:** make-one-shot-video-object-segmentation\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by combining test-time training with meta-learning, and to implement advanced optimization techniques for memory-efficient training, here are some key technical details and insights:\n\n### Methods for Combining Test-Time Training with Meta-Learning\n\n1. **Test-Time Fine-Tuning and Meta-Learning**:\n   - The concept of test-time fine-tuning can be integrated with meta-learning to adapt the model to new tasks or prompts efficiently. For instance, the approach described in involves selecting fine-tuning data from a large dataset based on the prompt, which can be meta-learned to optimize the selection process. This method ensures that the model is fine-tuned specifically for each prompt, enhancing its performance on underrepresented tasks.\n   - Meta-learning algorithms like Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) can be used to train the model to adapt quickly to new tasks with a few examples, which is particularly useful for test-time fine-tuning.\n\n2. **Active Fine-Tuning**:\n   - Active fine-tuning methods, such as those described in, can dynamically adapt the compute resources based on the expected performance gain. This approach involves meta-learning to select the most relevant data for fine-tuning, ensuring that the model adapts efficiently to the test-time environment.\n\n### Advanced Optimization Techniques for Memory-Efficient Training\n\n1. **Tiling and Hybrid Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Techniques like those in Lightning Attention-2, which use tiling to handle intra-block and inter-block components separately, can significantly reduce memory usage. Combining this with hybrid attention mechanisms (e.g., sliding window and linear attention as in BASED) can further optimize the memory-throughput tradeoff.\n\n2. **Low-Rank Approximations and Gradient Compression**:\n   - Methods like Loki, which exploit the low-dimensional nature of key vectors, can reduce memory usage by using sparse attention mechanisms. Additionally, gradient compression techniques and low-rank gradient projections (as in GaLore) can help in reducing the memory footprint during training.\n\n3. **Adaptive Batch Sizing and Caching Strategies**:\n   - Approaches like MECTA, which reduce batch sizes and adopt adaptive normalization layers, can help in managing the memory overhead during back-propagation. Stopping the back-propagation caching heuristically can also reduce memory usage.\n\n### Performance Analysis Frameworks for Adaptation Mechanisms\n\n1. **Evaluation Metrics for Test-Time Adaptation**:\n   - To evaluate the effectiveness of test-time adaptation mechanisms, metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs should be considered. For instance, the performance gains from test-time fine-tuning can be evaluated by comparing the model's performance before and after fine-tuning on specific prompts.\n\n2. **Comparative Analysis with Baselines**:\n   - Comparing the performance of the adapted model with baseline models (e.g., models without test-time fine-tuning or meta-learning) can provide insights into the effectiveness of the adaptation mechanisms. This is demonstrated in, where test-time fine-tuning outperforms in-context learning and other baseline methods.\n\n3. **Memory-Computation Tradeoffs**:\n   - Analyzing the tradeoffs between memory usage and computational overhead is crucial. Techniques like SIFT, which dynamically adapt compute resources based on expected performance gains, can help in optimizing this tradeoff.\n\n### Implementation Details and Performance Comparisons\n\n1. **VerifierQ and Q-Learning Integration**:\n   - Integrating Q-learning into the verifier model, as in VerifierQ, can enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs at test time. This approach involves offline Q-learning and conservative Q-learning formulations to manage large action spaces efficiently.\n\n2. **Meta-Learning for Test-Time Fine-Tuning**:\n   - Meta-learning can be used to optimize the process of selecting fine-tuning data, as mentioned in. This involves training a meta-model to predict the performance gain from fine-tuning on different data points, allowing for more efficient adaptation.\n\n3. **Memory-Efficient Training Strategies**:\n   - Implementing strategies like gradient checkpointing, pruning, and modular architecture design can help in balancing memory usage and computational overhead. These strategies are essential for ensuring that the model can scale efficiently while maintaining performance.\n\nBy combining these techniques, the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that adapts efficiently at test time, optimizes memory usage, and scales better with larger models and more data.\n",

Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** SPARSEK Attention is introduced, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance and can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models with minimal fine-tuning.\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers, especially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due to the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory requirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/41 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nThe idea is that we can compute step $t$ based on the results from step $t-1$ instead of starting from scratch. Algorithm 2 illustrates the algorithm, where highlighted lines are the main difference from Algorithm 1. We introduce two min-heaps (and maintain the sum of elements for each heap) for tracking the search progress of $(u, w)$ and achieving $O(1)$ evaluation of line 9 in Algorithm 2. Note that each insertion into a min-heap costs logarithmic time in the heap size and each $z_{t}$ introduces at most two more possible ( $u, w$ ) pairs (lines 2-6 in Algorithm 2). Therefore, executing Algorithm 2 over $m$ incremental sets (i.e., $m$ steps) costs $O(m \\log m)$ in total. As Peters et al. [54] have noted, the solution $\\boldsymbol{p}^{*}$ tends to contain only a few nonzeros, leading to small $u^{*}$ and $w^{*}$. Therefore, in practice, we can use partial sort on the $k^{\\prime}=O(k)$ largest values instead of full sort in Algorithm 1, thereby achieving a complexity of $O(m \\log k)$. With respect to Algorithm 2, this change is equivalent to restricting the size of the min-heap $\\mathcal{S}$ to an upper bound for achieving the same reduction in complexity. ### 3.4 Extensions\n\nTraining with fixed-size truncation-free cache Our selection method enables training on extremely long documents that need to be segmented into smaller chunks for recurrent processing. Algorithm 3 illustrates the process. Without introducing any additional truncation strategies or parameters, the algorithm maintains a fixed-size cache benefit by recurrent calculations and produces exactly the same results as calculating without chunking, which is guaranteed by the irreversibility of our selection method. To minimize the memory footprint, we stop the gradients of the cache, thereby pruning the computation graph, as in Transformer-XL [17]. With this algorithm, we can extend the training context length to hundreds of thousands of tokens. Combine with other efficient attention mechanism Our SPARSEK attention can be combined with other sparse attention as long as they have irreversible selection patterns. In this work, we integrate SPARSEK attention with sliding window (SW) attention by default, motivated by the well-known experience that sliding windows are simple yet incredibly strong for language modeling [58, 37]. Specifically, given a sliding window size $w$, we replace $\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}, \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}$ in (5) with\n\n$$\n\\hat{\\boldsymbol{K}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{K} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{K}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\quad \\hat{\\boldsymbol{V}}_{i}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\Delta_{i-w} \\boldsymbol{V} \\\\\n\\boldsymbol{V}_{i-w+1: i}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nThis combination does not introduce any overhead thanks to our fused Triton kernel. In this combination, SPARSEK attention attention aims at efficiently global (long-range) dependencies modeling, while SW attention is used for modeling local dependencies. Besides, SPARSEK attention can also be combined with linear attention methods, which hypothesize the existence of low-rank structures in attention scores rather than sparsity. From a theoretical perspective, Chen et al. [10] reveal that linear attention and sparse attention capture different attention patterns, and their combination provides a closer approximation to full attention. In this work, we extend their results to SparseK attention and recent attention optimizations [19]. For technical details, please refer to Appendix B.1. Straight-through estimator From TOPK to SpArseK, we employ relaxation techniques to facilitate gradient-based training. Alternatively, the straight-through estimator (ST) [5] can be utilized, i.e., $\\Delta^{\\text {st }}=\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}-\\operatorname{stop} \\_\\operatorname{grad}\\left(\\Delta^{\\text {soft }}\\right)+\\Delta^{\\text {hard }}$, allowing the model to perform true selection. By utilizing the ST method, the model achieves slightly improved efficiency since it bypasses the multiplication of selection scores during the forward pass. Our experimental results indicate that employing ST results in negligible performance degradation. Consequently, this technique shows promise in balancing performance and computational efficiency. ### 3.5 Techniques for Faster and More Stable Training\n\nWe introduce three beneficial modeling tricks discovered in our experiments. We also develop an optimized implementation based on FlashAttention- $2^{2}$ for obtaining practically efficient sparse attention.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.30)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/70 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nWe provide empirical evidence to support these findings. Synthetic experiments. Figures 4(a) and 4(b) show the evolution of the largest softmax probability and attention weights over time when using either normalized gradient or a fixed stepsize $\\eta$ for training.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.07)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 4. Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nWe include more details in Appendix F. Models. For real world datasets, we train decoder-only models (only contain causal masked attention layers) of three different scales, mirroring the GPT-2 family (Radford et al., 2019): Small, Medium and Large. For small scale models, we train models using context lengths from 512 to $32 k$. For medium scale models, we only train using context length $8 k$. For large scale models, we only train using context length 2 k . The reason that we did not train longer context length for medium and large scale models is that non-kernel based attention mechanisms (softmax, polynomial) are too slow or go out of memory (OOM). The detailed descriptions of model sizes can be found in Appendix H. We take the recipe of Transformer++ (see (Hua et al., 2022; Yang et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023) as well). We refer readers to Appendix I for a detailed description of the Transformer++ used by us. If not specified otherwise, we use 10k warmup steps, 125 k total training steps and a linear learning rate schedule. Depending on the original model scale, we also train kernel based attention models (Polysketch and Performer) with $0-3$ additional layers, since these models are significantly faster than non-kernel based attention models so we can afford to train larger models compared to vanilla softmax. It only slightly increases model sizes. Attention Mechanisms. We train models with the following 4 categories of attention mechanisms: (i) Softmax, (ii) Polynomial ( $p=2,4,8$ ), (iii) Polysketch (approximating polynomial attention of $p=4$ ) with variants enabling learned sketches (Section 2.3) or local exact polynomial attention (Section 3.2) or both, and (iv) Performer equipped with our lower triangular multiplication approach (Section 3.1) for handling causal masks. For both Performer and Polysketch, all attention heads share the same $\\phi^{\\prime}$ within the same attention layer. Hyper-parameters. For FlashAttention, we try both block size 256 and $512^{7}$. For our fast lower triangular multiplication approach, we use $b=1024$ for both Polysketch and Performer. We test both sketch sizes $r=32$ and $r=64$ for our Polysketch attention. We use 2048 features for Performer ${ }^{8}$. Pre-training metrics measurements (perplexities) over different context lengths. We train GPT-2 style small scale models equipped with different attention mechanisms on the Wiki-40B (Guo et al., 2020) and PG-19 (Rae et al., 2019) datasets with context length from 512 to 32 k where each training batch contains 1 M tokens. For all kernel based attentions (Performer and Polysketch), we use 13 layers instead of 12. More training details are mentioned in Appendix E. The perplexity results are shown in Figure 2 and training latencies are shown in Figure 4. Due to the space limit, we put all exact numbers in Appendix E including a detailed discussion. We observe that in the setting of 32 k context length, Polysketch (learned + local, $\\mathrm{r}=32$ ) achieves $\\mathbf{2 x}$ speed-up in comparison with FlashAttention of the fastest setup. As shown in Table 2 and Table 3 in Appendix E, when we increase the sketch size $r$ from 32 to 64 , we further reduce the perplexities. In addition, as shown in Table 4, Polysketch (learned + local, $r=64$ ) still keeps $\\sim 10 \\%$ speed-up in comparison with FlashAttention of the fastest setup. In addition, we observed that every kernelbased attention approach (Performer and Polysketch) with fast lower triangular matrix multiplication method almost keeps the same speed across different context lengths given that we use same number of training tokens per step.\n```\n\n#### 5. Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels.

Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 3. Test-time Adaptation for Machine Translation Evaluation by Uncertainty Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient updates test-time training attention mechanisms*\n\n*Runzhe Zhan, Xuebo Liu, Derek F. Wong, Cuilian Zhang, Lidia S. Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

Understanding the Role of Self Attention for Efficient Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient updates test-time training attention mechanisms*\n\n*Kyuhong Shim, Jungwook Choi, Wonyong Sung*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is discovered that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved and implemented the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieves noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention (SA) is a critical component of Transformer neural networks that have succeeded in automatic speech recognition (ASR). In this paper, we analyze the role of SA in Transformer-based ASR models for not only understanding the mechanism of improved recognition accuracy but also lowering the computational complexity. We reveal that SA performs two distinct roles: phonetic and linguistic localization. Especially, we show by experiments that phonetic localization in the lower layers extracts phonologically meaningful features from speech and reduces the phonetic variance in the utterance for proper linguistic localization in the upper layers. From this understanding, we discover that attention maps can be reused as long as their localization capability is preserved. To evaluate this idea, we implement the layer-wise attention map reuse on real GPU platforms and achieve up to 1.96 times speedup in inference and 33% savings in training time with noticeably improved ASR performance for the challenging benchmark on LibriSpeech dev/test-other dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. QSGD: Communication-Efficient SGD via Gradient Quantization and Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient updates test-time training attention mechanisms*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Demjan Grubic, Jerry Li, Ryota Tomioka, Milan Vojnovic*\n\n**TL;DR:** Quantized SGD is proposed, a family of compression schemes for gradient updates which provides convergence guarantees and leads to significant reductions in end-to-end training time, and can be extended to stochastic variance-reduced techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Parallel implementations of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) have received significant research attention, thanks to its excellent scalability properties. A fundamental barrier when parallelizing SGD is the high bandwidth cost of communicating gradient updates between nodes; consequently, several lossy compresion heuristics have been proposed, by which nodes only communicate quantized gradients. Although effective in practice, these heuristics do not always guarantee convergence, and it is not clear whether they can be improved. In this paper, we propose Quantized SGD (QSGD), a family of compression schemes for gradient updates which provides convergence guarantees. QSGD allows the user to smoothly trade off \\emph{communication bandwidth} and \\emph{convergence time}: nodes can adjust the number of bits sent per iteration, at the cost of possibly higher variance. We show that this trade-off is inherent, in the sense that improving it past some threshold would violate information-theoretic lower bounds. QSGD guarantees convergence for convex and non-convex objectives, under asynchrony, and can be extended to stochastic variance-reduced techniques. When applied to training deep neural networks for image classification and automated speech recognition, QSGD leads to significant reductions in end-to-end training time. For example, on 16GPUs, we can train the ResNet152 network to full accuracy on ImageNet 1.8x faster than the full-precision variant.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 1103  (*Influential: 195*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (ALMs) with a focus on efficient gradient updates in test-time training, combining different attention mechanisms, and dynamic adaptation of model capacity, here are some technical details and approaches that can be considered:\n\n## Methods for Efficient Gradient Updates in Test-Time Training\n\n### Adaptive Gradient-Rank and Moments\nThe \"AdaRankGrad\" method introduced in the paper on adaptive gradient-rank and moments for memory-efficient LLMs is particularly relevant. This technique involves adaptive low-rank gradient updates, which significantly reduce memory requirements during training while improving model performance. AdaRankGrad dynamically adjusts the projection subspace based on the convergence of gradients, ensuring that updates are performed in a lower-dimensional space, thereby reducing memory usage.\n\n### Gradient Accumulation\nGradient accumulation is another technique that allows for efficient training with large batch sizes by breaking them into smaller mini-batches and accumulating gradients before updating the model weights. This method is especially useful when memory constraints are a concern, as it simulates larger batch sizes without the associated memory overhead.\n\n### Test-Time Fine-Tuning\nTest-time fine-tuning, as discussed in the paper on efficiently learning at test-time, involves fine-tuning the model for a single gradient step on each selected sequence. This approach can be optimized by dynamically adapting the compute to the expected performance gain, ensuring that test-time compute is spent proportionally to the realized performance gains.\n\n## Techniques for Combining Different Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Modular Architecture\nCreating a modular architecture that allows for the selective activation of different attention mechanisms can be highly effective. For instance, combining FastTTTLinear's local convolutions with GPT-2 ALA's context-adaptive encoding can leverage the strengths of both approaches. This modular design enables the use of different attention mechanisms (e.g., linear attention, gated linear attention, or matrix-based attention) depending on the input patterns and computational efficiency requirements[Analysis Summary].\n\n### Context-Adaptive Encoding\nUsing context-adaptive encoding to guide both test-time training and meta-learning adaptation mechanisms can enhance performance. This involves adapting the encoding scheme based on the context of the input, which can be achieved through techniques like those mentioned in \"Learning to (Learn at Test Time)\" where TTT layers utilize larger hidden states to compress more information in long contexts[Analysis Summary].\n\n### Tiling and Chunked Processing\nImplementing tiling techniques for efficient attention computation and chunked processing for better memory efficiency can also be beneficial. These methods allow for the division of large attention matrices into smaller, more manageable parts, reducing computational and memory overhead[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Approaches for Dynamic Adaptation of Model Capacity\n\n### Adaptive Batch Sizing\nAdaptive batch sizing is crucial for dynamic adaptation of model capacity. Techniques like gradient accumulation can be used to adjust the effective batch size based on memory constraints and computational resources. This ensures that the model can adapt to different input sizes and computational budgets without significant performance degradation.\n\n### Low-Rank Gradient Updates\nThe AdaRankGrad method also provides a way to dynamically adjust the model capacity by updating the projection subspace based on the convergence of gradients. This approach ensures that the model's capacity is adapted to the decreasing dimensionality of the gradients as training progresses, leading to more efficient use of resources.\n\n### Selective Caching and Memory Optimization\nSelective caching and memory optimization techniques can help in dynamically adapting the model capacity. By decomposing gradients into a sum of gradients over the task's training images and back-propagating only a random subset, significant memory savings can be achieved. This is particularly useful in meta-learning scenarios where memory efficiency is critical[Analysis Summary].\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is highly efficient in terms of gradient updates, adaptable in its attention mechanisms, and dynamically scalable in its model capacity.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 3.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: gradient update mechanisms test-time training hybrid architecture integration*\n\n*Minh-Thang Luong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This tutorial describes in detail the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture of NMT, the maximum likelihood training approach, and a simple beam-search decoder to produce translations, and describes techniques to build state-of-the-art NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) is a simple new architecture for getting machines to learn to translate. Despite being relatively new (Kalchbrenner and Blunsom, 2013; Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), NMT has already shown promising results, achieving state-of-the-art performances for various language pairs (Luong et al, 2015a; Jean et al, 2015; Luong et al, 2015b; Sennrich et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016). While many of these NMT papers were presented to the ACL community, research and practice of NMT are only at their beginning stage. This tutorial would be a great opportunity for the whole community of machine translation and natural language processing to learn more about a very promising new approach to MT. This tutorial has four parts. In the first part, we start with an overview of MT approaches, including: (a) traditional methods that have been dominant over the past twenty years and (b) recent hybrid models with the use of neural network components. From these, we motivate why an end-to-end approach like neural machine translation is needed. The second part introduces a basic instance of NMT. We start out with a discussion of recurrent neural networks, including the back-propagation-through-time algorithm and stochastic gradient descent optimizers, as these are the foundation on which NMT builds. We then describe in detail the basic sequence-to-sequence architecture of NMT (Cho et al., 2014; Sutskever et al., 2014), the maximum likelihood training approach, and a simple beam-search decoder to produce translations. The third part of our tutorial describes techniques to build state-of-the-art NMT. We start with approaches to extend the vocabulary coverage of NMT (Luong et al., 2015a; Jean et al., 2015; Chitnis and DeNero, 2015). We then introduce the idea of jointly learning both translations and alignments through an attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2015); other variants of attention (Luong et al., 2015b; Tu et al., 2016) are discussed too. We describe a recent trend in NMT, that is to translate at the sub-word level (Chung et al., 2016; Luong and Manning, 2016; Sennrich et al., 2016), so that language variations can be effectively handled. We then give tips on training and testing NMT systems such as batching and ensembling. In the final part of the tutorial, we briefly describe promising approaches, such as (a) how to combine multiple tasks to help translation (Dong et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2016; Firat et al., 2016; Zoph and Knight, 2016) and (b) how to utilize monolingual corpora (Sennrich et al., 2016). Lastly, we conclude with challenges remained to be solved for future NMT. PS: we would also like to acknowledge the very first paper by Forcada and \u00d1eco (1997) on sequence-to-sequence models for translation!\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient gradient update mechanisms for test-time adaptation, integration patterns for hybrid attention architectures, performance metrics and benchmarks for adaptive attention mechanisms, and stability analysis of hybrid architectures, here are some key insights and references from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Efficient Gradient Update Mechanisms for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- The paper on \"Bridging the Gap between Model and Data for Test-time Adaptation\" introduces the MITA (Meet-In-The-Middle based Test Time Adaptation) method, which uses Contrastive Divergence to adapt the model to the test data distribution. This method involves a min-max game to minimize the energy of test data, which can be seen as an efficient gradient update mechanism for test-time adaptation.\n\n- The \"Feature Augmentation based Test-Time Adaptation\" (FATA) method employs feature augmentation and a specific loss function to adapt the model using limited test data. This approach enhances the model's ability to generalize from a small number of samples, which is crucial for efficient test-time adaptation.\n\n## Integration Patterns and Strategies for Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n- The concept of hybrid architectures is implicit in the discussion of combining different attention mechanisms. For instance, the \"CHELA\" architecture mentioned in the analysis note combines linear attention with convolutions, which is a hybrid approach that maintains stability and efficiency for long-sequence processing[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n- The REACT (Residual-Adaptive Contextual Tuning) framework, while not specifically focused on attention mechanisms, demonstrates a hybrid approach by decomposing model weights into meta and adaptive components. This decomposition allows for efficient adaptation to new distributions, which could be adapted to integrate different attention mechanisms.\n\n## Performance Metrics and Benchmarks for Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Performance metrics such as AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) and the number of parameters updated are used in the REACT framework to evaluate its efficiency. For adaptive attention mechanisms, similar metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs would be crucial.\n\n- The FATA method is evaluated on various models and scenarios, including ImageNet-C and Office-Home, using metrics such as accuracy and robustness. These benchmarks can serve as a reference for evaluating the performance of adaptive attention mechanisms in different real-world conditions.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Hybrid Architectures\n\n- The stability of hybrid architectures is a key consideration. The \"ReLA\" method mentioned in the analysis note uses specialized initialization and gating mechanisms to ensure stable training. Similarly, the MITA method stabilizes the adaptation process by aligning the model and data through energy-based optimization, which helps in maintaining stability during test-time adaptation[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\n- The integration of different attention mechanisms, such as linear attention and convolutions in the \"CHELA\" architecture, is designed to maintain stability while processing long sequences. This balance between adaptation and stability is crucial for the robustness of hybrid architectures[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n\nIn summary, the papers and analysis notes provide insights into:\n\n- **Efficient Gradient Update Mechanisms**: MITA and FATA offer methods for efficient test-time adaptation using Contrastive Divergence and feature augmentation, respectively.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining different attention mechanisms, such as linear attention and convolutions, and decomposing model weights into meta and adaptive components, as seen in CHELA and REACT[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n- **Performance Metrics and Benchmarks**: Evaluating performance using metrics like AUROC, accuracy, and robustness, with benchmarks on datasets like ImageNet-C and Office-Home.\n- **Stability Analysis**: Ensuring stability through specialized initialization, gating mechanisms, and energy-based optimization, as highlighted in ReLA, MITA, and CHELA[Analysis Note - Round 3].\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 554  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 4.

Gradient compression with error feedback is applied to reduce the communication cost in the gradient transmission process. Our convergence analysis of COMP-AMS shows that such compressed gradient averaging strategy yields same convergence rate as standard AMSGrad, and also exhibits the linear speedup effect w.r.t. the number of local workers. Compared with recently proposed protocols on distributed adaptive methods, COMP-AMS is simple and convenient. Numerical experiments are conducted to justify the theoretical findings, and demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve same test accuracy as the full-gradient AMSGrad with substantial communication savings. With its simplicity and efficiency, COMP-AMS can serve as a useful distributed training framework for adaptive gradient methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Reinforcement Learning for Control of Valves\n\n*From Search Query: test-time training linear attention adaptive gradient*\n\n*Rajesh Siraskar*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper is a study of reinforcement learning (RL) as an optimal-control strategy for control of nonlinear valves. It is evaluated against the PID (proportional-integral-derivative) strategy, using a unified framework. RL is an autonomous learning mechanism that learns by interacting with its environment. It is gaining increasing attention in the world of control systems as a means of building optimal-controllers for challenging dynamic and nonlinear processes. Published RL research often uses open-source tools (Python and OpenAI Gym environments). We use MATLAB's recently launched (R2019a) Reinforcement Learning Toolbox to develop the valve controller; trained using the DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy-Gradient) algorithm and Simulink to simulate the nonlinear valve and create the experimental test-bench for evaluation. Simulink allows industrial engineers to quickly adapt and experiment with other systems of their choice. Results indicate that the RL controller is extremely good at tracking the signal with speed and produces a lower error with respect to the reference signal. The PID, however, is better at disturbance rejection and hence provides a longer life for the valves. Successful machine learning involves tuning many hyperparameters requiring significant investment of time and efforts. We introduce \"Graded Learning\" as a simplified, application oriented adaptation of the more formal and algorithmic \"Curriculum for Reinforcement Learning\". It is shown via experiments that it helps converge the learning task of complex non-linear real world systems. Finally, experiential learnings gained from this research are corroborated against published research.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model by integrating test-time training with attention mechanisms, ensuring memory-efficient gradient updates, and incorporating adaptive computation, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Integration of Test-Time Training with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of Test-Time Training (TTT) is explored in the context of sequence modeling, particularly in the Vision-TTT layer, which dynamically updates the hidden states to capture long-range dependencies. This approach can be generalized to include attention mechanisms, as TTT layers are shown to be equivalent to self-attention mechanisms but with added flexibility for non-parametric learning tasks.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Gradient Updates and Adaptive Computation\n\n- The paper on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" discusses test-time fine-tuning, which involves fine-tuning the model parameters at test time. This approach is shown to be more efficient than in-context learning, especially in terms of computational complexity. The method adapts the number of gradient steps based on the prompt's complexity, ensuring efficient use of compute resources.\n\n- The \"Block Selective Reprogramming\" (BSR) approach for vision transformers (ViTs) highlights the importance of reducing activation memory during training. BSR selectively fine-tunes a fraction of the pre-trained weight tensors, reducing both memory and computational costs. This method could be adapted for language models to achieve similar efficiency gains.\n\n## Techniques for Combining Adaptive Mechanisms with Linear Attention\n\n- The \"Med-TTT: Vision Test-Time Training model\" introduces a Vision-TTT layer that integrates linear computational complexity with adaptive parameter updates. This layer can be seen as a generalization of self-attention and could be adapted for language models to combine with linear attention mechanisms. The use of mini-batch gradient descent and parallel computation reduces the overall computational complexity.\n\n- The \"Attention-Linear Trajectory Prediction\" model uses a combination of self-attention and linear modules. While focused on trajectory prediction, the efficiency analysis of the ProbSparse self-attention mechanism (with a computational complexity of O(Llog L)) and the linear module (with O(L) complexity) provides insights into how to efficiently combine attention and linear transformations. This could be applied to language models to enhance their efficiency and performance.\n\n## Methods for Dynamic Capacity Control in Neural Networks\n\n- The \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" paper discusses adaptive stopping of test-time fine-tuning based on the performance gain and compute used. This adaptive approach ensures that the model spends more compute on complex prompts and less on simpler ones, which can be seen as a form of dynamic capacity control.\n\n- The Vision-TTT layer's dynamic update of hidden states based on the current input and self-supervised learning mechanism can be viewed as a method for dynamic capacity control. This approach allows the model to adjust its capacity to handle varying sequence lengths and complexities.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, the researcher can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages test-time training, adaptive mechanisms, and efficient attention computation, while also ensuring memory-efficient gradient updates and dynamic capacity control. This hybrid approach has the potential to improve performance, reduce computational overhead, and enhance scalability.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/51 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Optimal Time Complexities of Parallel Stochastic Optimization Methods Under a Fixed Computation Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*A. Tyurin, Peter Richt\u00e1rik*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new protocol is proposed that generalizes the classical oracle framework approach and establishes minimax complexities for parallel optimization methods that have access to an unbiased stochastic gradient oracle with bounded variance.\n\n**Abstract:** Parallelization is a popular strategy for improving the performance of iterative algorithms. Optimization methods are no exception: design of efficient parallel optimization methods and tight analysis of their theoretical properties are important research endeavors. While the minimax complexities are well known for sequential optimization methods, the theory of parallel optimization methods is less explored. In this paper, we propose a new protocol that generalizes the classical oracle framework approach. Using this protocol, we establish minimax complexities for parallel optimization methods that have access to an unbiased stochastic gradient oracle with bounded variance. We consider a fixed computation model characterized by each worker requiring a fixed but worker-dependent time to calculate stochastic gradient. We prove lower bounds and develop optimal algorithms that attain them. Our results have surprising consequences for the literature of asynchronous optimization methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. AdaNPC: Exploring Non-Parametric Classifier for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Yi-Fan Zhang, Xue Wang, Kexin Jin, Kun Yuan, Zhang Zhang, Liang Wang, Rong Jin, Tien-Ping Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work adopts Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC), and builds a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains that can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent machine learning tasks focus to develop models that can generalize to unseen distributions. Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Yaofo Chen, S. Zheng, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An active sample selection criterion is proposed to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation, and a Fisher regularizer is introduced to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 222  (*Influential: 61*)\n\n#### 4. Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Yihua Zhang, Pingzhi Li, Junyuan Hong, Jiaxiang Li, Yimeng Zhang, Wenqing Zheng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jason D. Lee, Wotao Yin, Mingyi Hong, Zhangyang Wang, Sijia Liu, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance, and introduces novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity.\n\n**Abstract:** In the evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP), fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam has become standard. Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Eric Xing, Pengtao Xie, Willie Neiswanger, Sang Keun Choe*\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Memory Efficient Meta-Learning with Large Images\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Richard E. Turner, Sebastian Nowozin, Katja Hofmann, Massimiliano Patacchiola, Daniela Massiceti, John Bronskill*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta learning approaches to few-shot classification are computationally efficient at test time, requiring just a few optimization steps or single forward pass to learn a new task, but they remain highly memory-intensive to train. This limitation arises because a task's entire support set, which can contain up to 1000 images, must be processed before an optimization step can be taken. Harnessing the performance gains offered by large images thus requires either parallelizing the meta-learner across multiple GPUs, which may not be available, or trade-offs between task and image size when memory constraints apply. We improve on both options by proposing LITE, a general and memory efficient episodic training scheme that enables meta-training on large tasks composed of large images on a single GPU. We achieve this by observing that the gradients for a task can be decomposed into a sum of gradients over the task's training images. This enables us to perform a forward pass on a task's entire training set but realize significant memory savings by back-propagating only a random subset of these images which we show is an unbiased approximation of the full gradient. We use LITE to train meta-learners and demonstrate new state-of-the-art accuracy on the real-world ORBIT benchmark and 3 of the 4 parts of the challenging VTAB+MD benchmark relative to leading meta-learners. LITE also enables meta-learners to be competitive with transfer learning approaches but at a fraction of the test-time computational cost, thus serving as a counterpoint to the recent narrative that transfer learning is all you need for few-shot classification.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 3. MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation test-time memory optimization*\n\n*Michael Spranger, Jiayu Zhou, Lingjuan Lyu, Junyuan Hong*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memoryconstrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling\r\nshows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for backpropagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain\r\nstable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-theart CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy. Our codes can be accessed at https://github.com/SonyAI/MECTA.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2023-2\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient gradient computation, memory optimization, and hardware-efficient implementations of adaptive mechanisms, here are some key findings and strategies from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Efficient Gradient Computation for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n### Test-Time Fine-Tuning\nThe paper \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" highlights the importance of efficient gradient computation during test-time fine-tuning. It suggests that fine-tuning the model for a single gradient step on each selected sequence can significantly improve performance. However, this method is limited by the sample efficiency of test-time fine-tuning, where the number of gradient steps is directly proportional to inference time.\n\n### Gradient Accumulation\nThe technique of gradient accumulation, as discussed in \"Fixing Faulty Gradient Accumulation,\" can be used to simulate larger batch sizes without the memory overhead. However, it is crucial to address the issue of degraded performance when using gradient accumulation compared to training with larger actual batch sizes. This can be mitigated by careful management of the accumulation process and ensuring that the model updates are synchronized properly.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Neural Networks\n\n### Tiling and Block-Based Processing\nThe concept of tiling, as mentioned in the analysis note, can effectively reduce memory overhead. This involves handling intra-block and inter-block components separately in linear attention calculations, which retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length. Block-based processing can maintain efficiency and optimize memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n### Dynamic Self-Update Mechanism\nThe \"Meet-In-The-Middle based Test-Time Adaptation (MITA)\" method introduces a dynamic self-update mechanism for each instance within the batch via Langevin Dynamics. This approach allows for more efficient adaptation while maintaining batch parallel operations, which can result in significant performance improvements compared to other methods.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n### Linear Attention Mechanisms\nImplementations like Lightning Attention-2 demonstrate efficient linear attention mechanisms that can handle unlimited sequence lengths without significant memory overhead. Gated linear attention also shows promise for hardware-efficient training by optimizing the attention mechanism to reduce computational and memory requirements[Analysis Note].\n\n### Adaptive Compute Allocation\nThe work on \"Efficiently Learning at Test-Time: Active Fine-Tuning of LLMs\" suggests dynamically adapting compute to the expected performance gain. This approach ensures that test-time compute is allocated proportionally to the predicted performance gains, making the method more computationally scalable.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Test-Time Training\n\n### Handling Noisy Gradients\nThe stability of test-time adaptation is crucial, and handling noisy gradients is a key challenge. The analysis note highlights the need for mechanisms to handle noisy test samples that may disturb the model adaptation. Encouraging model weights to converge to a flat minimum can improve robustness and stability[Analysis Note].\n\n### Balance Between Adaptation and Stability\nThere needs to be a careful balance between the speed of adaptation and the stability of the model. Methods like MITA, which use energy-based optimization and dynamic self-update mechanisms, can help in achieving this balance by ensuring that the model adapts effectively while maintaining stability.\n\nIn summary, to improve autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on:\n\n- **Efficient Gradient Computation**: Utilize techniques like gradient accumulation and single-gradient-step fine-tuning to optimize gradient computation during test-time adaptation.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Employ tiling and block-based processing, and leverage dynamic self-update mechanisms to reduce memory overhead.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Implement efficient linear attention mechanisms and adapt compute allocation dynamically based on expected performance gains.\n- **Stability Analysis**: Develop mechanisms to handle noisy gradients and ensure a balance between adaptation speed and stability to maintain robust performance.\n\nThese strategies can help in achieving better overall performance, scalability, and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

By changing $d^{\\prime}$ we modulate the size of the recurrent state. How does the choice of feature map affect the memory-recall tradeoff? Prior work demonstrates the strong performance of the Taylor feature map on associative recall [13]. Building on this analysis, we evaluate a broad set of feature maps $\\left(\\phi_{\\operatorname{ReLU}}(x)=\\max (x, 0)\\right.$, $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}(x)=\\operatorname{ELU}(x)+1, \\phi_{\\text {Square }}(x)=x^{2}, \\phi_{\\text {Identity }}(x)=x$, $\\phi_{\\text {CosFormer }}$ as defined in [23], and $\\phi_{\\text {Performer }}$ as defined in 21]) using the experimental setup described in Section 3.1. In Figure 3 (top), we plot the memory-recall tradeoff curves for these feature maps. The Taylor series feature map, along with the simple $\\phi_{\\text {PosELU }}$ and $\\phi_{\\text {ReLU }}$ feature maps, sits at the pareto frontier. One advantage of the Taylor feature map over these alternatives is that it expands the recurrent state size (improving recall capacity) without changing the number of parameters. As shown in Figure 3 (bottom), the Taylor series feature map requires fewer parameters than alternatives to achieve high recall capacity. This analysis and the ablations in Table 4 informed our decision to use the Taylor approximation, though other simple feature maps may be effective as well. ### 4.2 Local Exact Attention with Tensor Core Sliding Windows\n\nTo efficiently model fine-grained local interactions, BASED uses sliding window attention with window sizes set at small multiples of 16 (up to 64 tokens). Similar to past (causal) implementations 18 , 19], for window size $w$ each query $\\boldsymbol{q}_{i}$ only attends to past keys $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i-w+1}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}\\right\\}$. This enables $\\mathcal{O}(N w)$ time and space complexity for linear scaling in sequence length $N$, with a $w$-sized KV-cache for constant-memory generation. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_8d23281e475274f360feg-07.jpg?height=909&width=472&top_left_y=630&top_left_x=1355)\n\nFigure 3: Linear attention feature maps on AR. $x$ : state size (bytes) during generation or param. count; $y$ : MQAR accuracy. This setting is harder than fig. 2 (256 key-value pairs). sizes 256 [17] to 4096 [10, BASED uses only $w=16,32$, or 64 to best exploit modern GPUs. In Section 5, we discuss how this \"Tensor core-aware\" window (TCWINDOW) achieves $1 \\mathrm{e}-5 \\times$ the latency than the $w=4096$ windows in modern LLMs (e.g., Mistral 7B [10]). While the small $w$ in TCWindOW enable fast local and exact attention, it presents a challenge for long range modeling. With just $w=64$, for every layer of $w=4096$ Mistral sliding window attention we would require 64 layers of BASED to achieve the same receptive field. Controlling for model depth and sequence length, Figure 2 indeed shows smaller $w$ linearly decreasing in associative recall accuracy. BASED's global linear attention described above overcomes the lack of long-range modeling presented with low $w$. Additional architectural details for BASED are discussed in Appendix C and the hybridization of layers used in experiments are provided in Table 7. We include ablations of architectural choices in Table 4 and evaluate the overall quality and efficiency of BASED in Section 6 . ## 5 Efficient Implementation\n\nIn this section we focus on the efficiency of BASED. A na\u00efve implementation is slower than the most efficient standard attention implementations (shown in Figure 4) as it requires large amounts of high latency memory movement. We first describe preliminaries of the GPU execution model and memory hierarchy. We next present the baseline and our hardware-aware algorithms for linear attention in Section 5.1 and for sliding window attention in Section 5.2 .\n```\n\n#### 4.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention hardware efficient implementation adaptive attention mechanisms stability*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention hardware efficient implementation adaptive attention mechanisms stability*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

However, the advantages of vision Transformers also come with a price: Self-attention, the core part of Transformer, has a quadratic complexity to the input sequence length. This leads to a dramatic increase of computation and memory cost with the increase of sequence length, thus introducing difficulties when applying Transformers to the vision tasks that require dense predictions based on high-resolution feature maps. In this paper, we propose a new vision Transformer, named Glance-and-Gaze Transformer (GG-Transformer), to address the aforementioned issues. It is motivated by the Glance and Gaze behavior of human beings when recognizing objects in natural scenes, with the ability to efficiently model both long-range dependencies and local context. In GG-Transformer, the Glance and Gaze behavior is realized by two parallel branches: The Glance branch is achieved by performing self-attention on the adaptively-dilated partitions of the input, which leads to a linear complexity while still enjoying a global receptive field; The Gaze branch is implemented by a simple depth-wise convolutional layer, which compensates local image context to the features obtained by the Glance mechanism. We empirically demonstrate our method achieves consistently superior performance over previous state-of-the-art Transformers on various vision tasks and benchmarks.

    "proposal": "# AdaptiveTTT: Combining Test-Time Training with Adaptive Linear Attention for Efficient Language Modeling\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face challenges in efficiently handling long sequences while maintaining adaptability to varied input contexts. FastTTTLinear offers powerful test-time training capabilities but has complex integration requirements, while GPT-2 ALA provides efficient adaptation mechanisms but faces computational overhead from meta-learning. By combining their strengths and addressing their limitations, we can create a more efficient and robust architecture.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Parent 1: FastTTTLinear\nStrengths:\n- Test-time training with expressive hidden states\n- Linear complexity through gated linear attention\n- Local convolutional augmentation for causality\n\nLimitations:\n- Complex integration of multiple mechanisms\n- Potential overhead from test-time updates\n\n### Parent 2: GPT-2 ALA\nStrengths:\n- Dynamic adaptation to input context\n- Memory bandwidth optimization\n- Meta-learning for weight adjustment\n\nLimitations:\n- Computational overhead from meta-learning\n- Complex implementation requirements\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nAdaptiveTTT combines the test-time training capabilities of FastTTTLinear with the adaptive mechanisms of GPT-2 ALA through a unified framework that:\n1.
