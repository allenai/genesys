Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. FLuRKA: Fast and accurate unified Low-Rank&Kernel Attention (Avg.

Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/83 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[2021], Zheng et al.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3.

We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Infusing Lattice Symmetry Priors in Attention Mechanisms for Sample-Efficient Abstract Geometric Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mattia Atzeni, Mrinmaya Sachan, Andreas Loukas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on geometry priors and introduces LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks that provides preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Abstract:** The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) (Chollet, 2019) and its most recent language-complete instantiation (LARC) has been postulated as an important step towards general AI. Yet, even state-of-the-art machine learning models struggle to achieve meaningful performance on these problems, falling behind non-learning based approaches. We argue that solving these tasks requires extreme generalization that can only be achieved by proper accounting for core knowledge priors. As a step towards this goal, we focus on geometry priors and introduce LatFormer, a model that incorporates lattice symmetry priors in attention masks. We show that, for any transformation of the hypercubic lattice, there exists a binary attention mask that implements that group action. Hence, our study motivates a modification to the standard attention mechanism, where attention weights are scaled using soft masks generated by a convolutional network. Experiments on synthetic geometric reasoning show that LatFormer requires 2 orders of magnitude fewer data than standard attention and transformers. Moreover, our results on ARC and LARC tasks that incorporate geometric priors provide preliminary evidence that these complex datasets do not lie out of the reach of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. L-Eval: Instituting Standardized Evaluation for Long Context Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"long-context language models\"*\n\n*Chen An, Shansan Gong, Ming Zhong, Mukai Li, Jun Zhang, Lingpeng Kong, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive study of 4 popular commercial LLMs and 12 open-source counterparts using the L-Eval benchmark, which shows that popular n-gram matching metrics generally can not correlate well with human judgment, and thus strongly advocate for length-instruction-enhanced (LIE) evaluation and employing LLM judges.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, there has been growing interest in extending the context length of large language models (LLMs), aiming to effectively process long inputs of one turn or conversations with more extensive histories. While proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude can largely preserve the reasoning ability in an extended context, open-source models are still progressing through the early stages of development. To bridge this gap, we propose L-Eval to institute a more standardized evaluation for long context language models (LCLMs) addressing two key aspects: dataset construction and evaluation metrics. On the one hand, we build a new evaluation suite containing 20 sub-tasks, 508 long documents, and over 2,000 human-labeled query-response pairs encompassing diverse question styles, domains, and input length (3k$\\sim$200k tokens). On the other hand, we investigate the effectiveness in evalution metrics for LCLMs. Results show that popular n-gram matching metrics generally can not correlate well with human judgment, and thus we strongly advocate for length-instruction-enhanced (LIE) evaluation and employing LLM judges. We conducted a comprehensive study of 4 popular commercial LLMs and 12 open-source counterparts using the L-Eval benchmark. Our empirical findings offer useful insights into the study of LCLMs and lay the groundwork for the development of more principled evaluation of these models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 83  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 8. LooGLE: Can Long-Context Language Models Understand Long Contexts?\n\n*From Search Query: \"long-context language models\"*\n\n*Jiaqi Li, Mengmeng Wang, Zilong Zheng, Muhan Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents LooGLE, a Long Context Generic Language Evaluation benchmark for LLMs' long context understanding, which provides a systematic and comprehensive evaluation schema on long-context LLMs, and sheds light on future development of enhanced models towards true long- context understanding.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs), despite their impressive performance in various language tasks, are typically limited to processing texts within context-window size. This limitation has spurred significant research efforts to enhance LLMs' long-context understanding with high-quality long-sequence benchmarks. However, prior datasets in this regard suffer from shortcomings, such as short context length compared to the context window of modern LLMs; outdated documents that have data leakage problems; and an emphasis on short dependency tasks rather than long dependency tasks. In this paper, we present LooGLE, a Long Context Generic Language Evaluation benchmark for LLMs' long context understanding. LooGLE features relatively new documents post-2022, with over 24,000 tokens per document and 6,000 newly generated questions spanning diverse domains. Human annotators meticulously crafted more than 1,100 high-quality question-answer pairs to meet the long dependency requirements. These pairs underwent thorough cross-validation, yielding the most precise assessment of LLMs' long dependency capabilities. The evaluation of eight state-of-the-art LLMs on LooGLE revealed key findings: (i) commercial models outperformed open-sourced models; (ii) LLMs excelled in short dependency tasks like short question-answering and cloze tasks but struggled with more intricate long dependency tasks; (iii) in-context learning and chaining thoughts offered only marginal improvements; (iv) retrieval-based techniques demonstrated substantial benefits for short question-answering, while strategies for extending context window length had limited impact on long context understanding. As such, LooGLE not only provides a systematic and comprehensive evaluation schema on long-context LLMs, but also sheds light on future development of enhanced models towards\"true long-context understanding\".\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 9.

Despite this progress, we find that these models struggle with multi-hop reasoning and exhibit decreased performance in the presence of noisy contexts. In this paper, we introduce Reasoning with Attributions, a novel approach that prompts LMs to supply attributions for each assertion during their reasoning. We validate our approach through experiments on three multi-hop datasets, employing both proprietary and open-source models, and demonstrate its efficacy and resilience. Furthermore, we explore methods to augment reasoning capabilities via fine-tuning and offer an attribution-annotated dataset and a specialized training strategy.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact,\nas it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited\ndevices with less memory.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03T03:56:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-25T04:04:05Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using\nthe second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention\nmechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input\nand an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention\noperation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information.

Chain and Causal Attention for Efficient Entity Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Erwan Fagnou, Paul Caillon, Blaise Delattre, Alexandre Allauzen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates the limitations of transformers for entity-tracking\ntasks in large language models.

To address this issue, we propose an efficient\nand frugal enhancement to the standard attention mechanism, enabling it to\nmanage long-term dependencies more efficiently. By considering attention as an\nadjacency matrix, our model can track entity states with a single layer.\nEmpirical results demonstrate significant improvements in entity tracking\ndatasets while keeping competitive performance on standard natural language\nmodeling. Our modified attention allows us to achieve the same performance with\ndrastically fewer layers. Additionally, our enhanced mechanism reveals\nstructured internal representations of attention.

Should we Stop Training More Monolingual Models, and Simply Use Machine\n  Translation Instead?\n\n*From Search Query: \"long-context language models\"*\n\n*Tim Isbister, Fredrik Carlsson, Magnus Sahlgren*\n\n**Abstract:** Most work in NLP makes the assumption that it is desirable to develop\nsolutions in the native language in question. There is consequently a strong\ntrend towards building native language models even for low-resource languages.\nThis paper questions this development, and explores the idea of simply\ntranslating the data into English, thereby enabling the use of pretrained, and\nlarge-scale, English language models. We demonstrate empirically that a large\nEnglish language model coupled with modern machine translation outperforms\nnative language models in most Scandinavian languages. The exception to this is\nFinnish, which we assume is due to inferior translation quality. Our results\nsuggest that machine translation is a mature technology, which raises a serious\ncounter-argument for training native language models for low-resource\nlanguages. This paper therefore strives to make a provocative but important\npoint. As English language models are improving at an unprecedented pace, which\nin turn improves machine translation, it is from an empirical and environmental\nstand-point more effective to translate data from low-resource languages into\nEnglish, than to build language models for such languages.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-21T10:21:24Z  (*Updated: 2021-04-21T10:21:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention\"*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3.

BAM: A Balanced Attention Mechanism for Single Image Super Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Cheng Shen, Haotian Hu, Fanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recovering texture information from the aliasing regions has always been a major challenge for Single Image Super Resolution (SISR) task. These regions are often submerged in noise so that we have to restore texture details while suppressing noise. To address this issue, we propose a Balanced Attention Mechanism (BAM), which consists of Avgpool Channel Attention Module (ACAM) and Maxpool Spatial Attention Module (MSAM) in parallel. ACAM is designed to suppress extreme noise in the large scale feature maps while MSAM preserves high-frequency texture details. Thanks to the parallel structure, these two modules not only conduct self-optimization, but also mutual optimization to obtain the balance of noise reduction and high-frequency texture restoration during the back propagation process, and the parallel structure makes the inference faster. To verify the effectiveness and robustness of BAM, we applied it to 10 SOTA SISR networks. The results demonstrate that BAM can efficiently improve the networks performance, and for those originally with attention mechanism, the substitution with BAM further reduces the amount of parameters and increases the inference speed. Moreover, we present a dataset with rich texture aliasing regions in real scenes, named realSR7. Experiments prove that BAM achieves better super-resolution results on the aliasing area.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"long-context language models\"*\n\n*Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Hari Subramoni, Aamir Shafi, Olatunji Ruwase, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs, Jinghan Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 6.

However, concern over the cost of training the attention mechanism to learn complex dependencies between distant inputs continues to grow. In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers. We demonstrate its effectiveness on the challenging task of protein sequence modeling and provide detailed theoretical analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n\n",

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 32 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 6 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"linear attention in RNNs\", \"test-time training efficient attention\", \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\", \"stateful linear attention\", \"linear attention in recurrent networks\", \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 14 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 349  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 2. Finetuning Pretrained Transformers into RNNs\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in RNNs\"*\n\n*Jungo Kasai, Hao Peng, Yizhe Zhang, Dani Yogatama, Gabriel Ilharco, Nikolaos Pappas, Yi Mao, Weizhu Chen, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a swap-then-finetune procedure, which in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, replaces the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune, and provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have outperformed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) in natural language generation. But this comes with a signifi- cant computational cost, as the attention mechanism\u2019s complexity scales quadratically with sequence length. Efficient transformer variants have received increasing interest in recent works. Among them, a linear-complexity recurrent variant has proven well suited for autoregressive generation. It approximates the softmax attention with randomized or heuristic feature maps, but can be difficult to train and may yield suboptimal accuracy. This work aims to convert a pretrained transformer into its efficient recurrent counterpart, improving efficiency while maintaining accuracy. Specifically, we propose a swap-then-finetune procedure: in an off-the-shelf pretrained transformer, we replace the softmax attention with its linear-complexity recurrent alternative and then finetune. With a learned feature map, our approach provides an improved tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy over the standard transformer and other recurrent variants. We also show that the finetuning process has lower training cost relative to training these recurrent variants from scratch. As many models for natural language tasks are increasingly dependent on large-scale pretrained transformers, this work presents a viable approach to improving inference efficiency without repeating the expensive pretraining process.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 3. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training efficient attention\"*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 552  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we attempt to explore low-precision training from a new perspective as inspired by recent findings in understanding DNN training: we conjecture that DNNs' precision might have a similar effect as the learning rate during DNN training, and advocate dynamic precision along the training trajectory for further boosting the time/energy efficiency of DNN training. Specifically, we propose Cyclic Precision Training (CPT) to cyclically vary the precision between two boundary values which can be identified using a simple precision range test within the first few training epochs. Extensive simulations and ablation studies on five datasets and eleven models demonstrate that CPT's effectiveness is consistent across various models/tasks (including classification and language modeling). Furthermore, through experiments and visualization we show that CPT helps to (1) converge to a wider minima with a lower generalization error and (2) reduce training variance which we believe opens up a new design knob for simultaneously improving the optimization and efficiency of DNN training.

Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is pioneeringly confirmed that properly incorporating activation quantization into the PTQ reconstruction benefits the final accuracy, and a simple yet effective approach dubbed as QDROP is proposed, which randomly drops the quantization of activations during PTQ.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, post-training quantization (PTQ) has driven much attention to produce efficient neural networks without long-time retraining. Despite its low cost, current PTQ works tend to fail under the extremely low-bit setting. In this study, we pioneeringly confirm that properly incorporating activation quantization into the PTQ reconstruction benefits the final accuracy. To deeply understand the inherent reason, a theoretical framework is established, indicating that the flatness of the optimized low-bit model on calibration and test data is crucial. Based on the conclusion, a simple yet effective approach dubbed as QDROP is proposed, which randomly drops the quantization of activations during PTQ. Extensive experiments on various tasks including computer vision (image classification, object detection) and natural language processing (text classification and question answering) prove its superiority. With QDROP, the limit of PTQ is pushed to the 2-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy boost can be up to 51.49%. Without bells and whistles, QDROP establishes a new state of the art for PTQ.

PoNet: Pooling Network for Efficient Token Mixing in Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Chao-Hong Tan, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Qinglin Zhang, Siqi Zheng, Zhenhua Ling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel Pooling Network (PoNet) for token mixing in long sequences with linear complexity and designs multi-granularity pooling and pooling fusion to capture different levels of contextual information and combine their interactions with tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved great success in various NLP, vision, and speech tasks. However, the core of Transformer, the self-attention mechanism, has a quadratic time and memory complexity with respect to the sequence length, which hinders applications of Transformer-based models to long sequences. Many approaches have been proposed to mitigate this problem, such as sparse attention mechanisms, low-rank matrix approximations and scalable kernels, and token mixing alternatives to self-attention. We propose a novel Pooling Network (PoNet) for token mixing in long sequences with linear complexity. We design multi-granularity pooling and pooling fusion to capture different levels of contextual information and combine their interactions with tokens. On the Long Range Arena benchmark, PoNet significantly outperforms Transformer and achieves competitive accuracy, while being only slightly slower than the fastest model, FNet, across all sequence lengths measured on GPUs. We also conduct systematic studies on the transfer learning capability of PoNet and observe that PoNet achieves 95.7% of the accuracy of BERT on the GLUE benchmark, outperforming FNet by 4.5% relative. Comprehensive ablation analysis demonstrates effectiveness of the designed multi-granularity pooling and pooling fusion for token mixing in long sequences and efficacy of the designed pre-training tasks for PoNet to learn transferable contextualized language representations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1345  (*Influential: 135*)\n\n#### 9.

We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics.

Hidden Traveling Waves bind Working Memory Variables in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in recurrent networks\"*\n\n*Arjun Karuvally, T. Sejnowski, H. Siegelmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem, and suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential in advancing neural network architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Traveling waves are a fundamental phenomenon in the brain, playing a crucial role in short-term information storage. In this study, we leverage the concept of traveling wave dynamics within a neural lattice to formulate a theoretical model of neural working memory, study its properties, and its real world implications in AI. The proposed model diverges from traditional approaches, which assume information storage in static, register-like locations updated by interference. Instead, the model stores data as waves that is updated by the wave's boundary conditions. We rigorously examine the model's capabilities in representing and learning state histories, which are vital for learning history-dependent dynamical systems. The findings reveal that the model reliably stores external information and enhances the learning process by addressing the diminishing gradient problem. To understand the model's real-world applicability, we explore two cases: linear boundary condition (LBC) and non-linear, self-attention-driven boundary condition (SBC). The model with the linear boundary condition results in a shift matrix plus low-rank matrix currently used in H3 state space RNN. Further, our experiments with LBC reveal that this matrix is effectively learned by Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) through backpropagation when modeling history-dependent dynamical systems. Conversely, the SBC parallels the autoregressive loop of an attention-only transformer with the context vector representing the wave substrate. Collectively, our findings suggest the broader relevance of traveling waves in AI and its potential in advancing neural network architectures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 11.

Here we study auto-regressive Transformers with linearised attention, a.k.a. linear Transformers (LTs) or Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs). LTs are special in the sense that they are equivalent to RNN-like sequence processors with a fixed-size state, while they can also be expressed as the now-popular self-attention networks. We show that many well-known results for the standard Transformer directly transfer to LTs/FWPs. Our formal language recognition experiments demonstrate how recently proposed FWP extensions such as recurrent FWPs and self-referential weight matrices successfully overcome certain limitations of the LT, e.g., allowing for generalisation on the parity problem.

HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

Chao, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data, by employing the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during testTime.\n\n**Abstract:** The neural metrics recently received considerable attention from the research community in the automatic evaluation of machine translation. Unlike text-based metrics that have interpretable and consistent evaluation mechanisms for various data sources, the reliability of neural metrics in assessing out-of-distribution data remains a concern due to the disparity between training data and real-world data. This paper aims to address the inference bias of neural metrics through uncertainty minimization during test time, without requiring additional data. Our proposed method comprises three steps: uncertainty estimation, test-time adaptation, and inference. Specifically, the model employs the prediction uncertainty of the current data as a signal to update a small fraction of parameters during test time and subsequently refine the prediction through optimization. To validate our approach, we apply the proposed method to three representative models and conduct experiments on the WMT21 benchmarks. The results obtained from both in-domain and out-of-distribution evaluations consistently demonstrate improvements in correlation performance across different models. Furthermore, we provide evidence that the proposed method effectively reduces model uncertainty.

Generally, L2O develops a parameterized optimization method (i.e., ``optimizer\") by learning from solving sample problems. This data-driven procedure yields L2O that can efficiently solve problems similar to those seen in training, that is, drawn from the same ``task distribution\". However, such learned optimizers often struggle when new test problems come with a substantially deviation from the training task distribution. This paper investigates a potential solution to this open challenge, by meta-training an L2O optimizer that can perform fast test-time self-adaptation to an out-of-distribution task, in only a few steps. We theoretically characterize the generalization of L2O, and further show that our proposed framework (termed as M-L2O) provably facilitates rapid task adaptation by locating well-adapted initial points for the optimizer weight. Empirical observations on several classic tasks like LASSO and Quadratic, demonstrate that M-L2O converges significantly faster than vanilla L2O with only $5$ steps of adaptation, echoing our theoretical results.

These architectures are typically made up of several\ncomputationally complex components such as; non-linear activation functions,\nnormalization, bi-directional dependence and attention. In order to maintain\ngood accuracy, these components are frequently run using full-precision\nfloating-point computation, making them slow, inefficient and difficult to\ndeploy on edge devices.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in RNNs\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training efficient attention\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer.

Luna: Linear Unified Nested Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's\nattention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences.\nIn this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism\nthat approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions,\nyielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity.\nSpecifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence\ninto a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using\nthe second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention\nmechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input\nand an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention\noperation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We\nperform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks:\nlong-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language\nmodeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental\nresults demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a\nvariety\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-03T01:47:26Z  (*Updated: 2021-11-02T20:23:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. MUSE: Parallel Multi-Scale Attention for Sequence to Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Guangxiang Zhao, Xu Sun, Jingjing Xu, Zhiyuan Zhang, Liangchen Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** In sequence to sequence learning, the self-attention mechanism proves to be\nhighly effective, and achieves significant improvements in many tasks. However,\nthe self-attention mechanism is not without its own flaws. Although\nself-attention can model extremely long dependencies, the attention in deep\nlayers tends to overconcentrate on a single token, leading to insufficient use\nof local information and difficultly in representing long sequences. In this\nwork, we explore parallel multi-scale representation learning on sequence data,\nstriving to capture both long-range and short-range language structures. To\nthis end, we propose the Parallel MUlti-Scale attEntion (MUSE) and MUSE-simple.\nMUSE-simple contains the basic idea of parallel multi-scale sequence\nrepresentation learning, and it encodes the sequence in parallel, in terms of\ndifferent scales with the help from self-attention, and pointwise\ntransformation. MUSE builds on MUSE-simple and explores combining convolution\nand self-attention for learning sequence representations from more different\nscales. We focus on machine translation and the proposed approach achieves\nsubstantial performance improvements over Transformer, especially on long\nsequences. More importantly, we find that although conceptually simple, its\nsuccess in practice requires intricate considerations, and the multi-scale\nattention must build on unified semantic space. Under common setting, the\nproposed model achieves substantial performance and outperforms all previous\nmodels on three main machine translation tasks. In addition, MUSE has potential\nfor accelerating inference due to its parallelism. Code will be available at\nhttps://github.com/lancopku/MUSE\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-17T09:36:07Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-17T09:36:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for\n  Long-Range Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"*\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers,\nespecially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due\nto the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory\nrequirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce\nSPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome\nthese computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our\napproach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator,\nSPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby\nenabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers\nlinear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation.\nExperimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse\nattention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both\ntraining and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution\nfor effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 8. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 10 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in RNNs\"*\n\n*Fran\u00e7ois Fleuret, Angelos Katharopoulos, Nikolaos Pappas, Apoorv Vyas*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mutual Information Scaling and Expressive Power of Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in RNNs\"*\n\n*Huitao Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence models assign probabilities to variable-length sequences such as natural language texts. The ability of sequence models to capture temporal dependence can be characterized by the temporal scaling of correlation and mutual information. In this paper, we study the mutual information of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) including long short-term memories and self-attention networks such as Transformers. Through a combination of theoretical study of linear RNNs and empirical study of nonlinear RNNs, we find their mutual information decays exponentially in temporal distance. On the other hand, Transformers can capture long-range mutual information more efficiently, making them preferable in modeling sequences with slow power-law mutual information, such as natural languages and stock prices. We discuss the connection of these results with statistical mechanics. We also point out the non-uniformity problem in many natural language datasets. We hope this work provides a new perspective in understanding the expressive power of sequence models and shed new light on improving the architecture of them.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training efficient attention\"*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sequence-to-Sequence Learning as Beam-Search Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training efficient attention\"*\n\n*Alexander M.

Seq2seq builds on deep neural language modeling and\ninherits its remarkable accuracy in estimating local, next-word distributions.\nIn this work, we introduce a model and beam-search training scheme, based on\nthe work of Daume III and Marcu (2005), that extends seq2seq to learn global\nsequence scores. This structured approach avoids classical biases associated\nwith local training and unifies the training loss with the test-time usage,\nwhile preserving the proven model architecture of seq2seq and its efficient\ntraining approach. We show that our system outperforms a highly-optimized\nattention-based seq2seq system and other baselines on three different sequence\nto sequence tasks: word ordering, parsing, and machine translation.\n\n**Conference:** sequence-to-sequence-learning-as-beam-search-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 5. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 6. Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory-efficient attention mechanisms for long sequences\"*\n\n*Furu Wei, Jianyong Wang, Jilong Xue, Yuqing Xia, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Yutao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code will be available at https://aka.ms/retnet.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 7. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention\"*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Songlin Yang, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \\citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 8. LARNN: Linear Attention Recurrent Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in recurrent networks\"*\n\n*Guillaume Chevalier*\n\n**Abstract:** The Linear Attention Recurrent Neural Network (LARNN) is a recurrent\nattention module derived from the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) cell and ideas\nfrom the consciousness Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). Yes, it LARNNs. The\nLARNN uses attention on its past cell state values for a limited window size\n$k$. The formulas are also derived from the Batch Normalized LSTM (BN-LSTM)\ncell and the Transformer Network for its Multi-Head Attention Mechanism. The\nMulti-Head Attention Mechanism is used inside the cell such that it can query\nits own $k$ past values with the attention window. This has the effect of\naugmenting the rank of the tensor with the attention mechanism, such that the\ncell can perform complex queries to question its previous inner memories, which\nshould augment the long short-term effect of the memory. With a clever trick,\nthe LARNN cell with attention can be easily used inside a loop on the cell\nstate, just like how any other Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) cell can be\nlooped linearly through time series. This is due to the fact that its state,\nwhich is looped upon throughout time steps within time series, stores the inner\nstates in a \"first in, first out\" queue which contains the $k$ most recent\nstates and on which it is easily possible to add static positional encoding\nwhen the queue is represented as a tensor. This neural architecture yields\nbetter results than the vanilla LSTM cells. It can obtain results of 91.92% for\nthe test accuracy, compared to the previously attained 91.65% using vanilla\nLSTM cells. Note that this is not to compare to other research, where up to\n93.35% is obtained, but costly using 18 LSTM cells rather than with 2 to 3\ncells as analyzed here. Finally, an interesting discovery is made, such that\nadding activation within the multi-head attention mechanism's linear layers can\nyield better results in the context researched hereto.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-16\n\n\n\n#### 9. Neural Speech Synthesis with Transformer Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"*\n\n*Ming Zhou, Sheng Zhao, Naihan Li, Shujie Liu, Yanqing Liu, Ming Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Although end-to-end neural text-to-speech (TTS) methods (such as Tacotron2)\nare proposed and achieve state-of-the-art performance, they still suffer from\ntwo problems: 1) low efficiency during training and inference; 2) hard to model\nlong dependency using current recurrent neural networks (RNNs). Inspired by the\nsuccess of Transformer network in neural machine translation (NMT), in this\npaper, we introduce and adapt the multi-head attention mechanism to replace the\nRNN structures and also the original attention mechanism in Tacotron2. With the\nhelp of multi-head self-attention, the hidden states in the encoder and decoder\nare constructed in parallel, which improves the training efficiency. Meanwhile,\nany two inputs at different times are connected directly by self-attention\nmechanism, which solves the long range dependency problem effectively. Using\nphoneme sequences as input, our Transformer TTS network generates mel\nspectrograms, followed by a WaveNet vocoder to output the final audio results.\nExperiments are conducted to test the efficiency and performance of our new\nnetwork. For the efficiency, our Transformer TTS network can speed up the\ntraining about 4.25 times faster compared with Tacotron2. For the performance,\nrigorous human tests show that our proposed model achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance (outperforms Tacotron2 with a gap of 0.048) and is very close to\nhuman quality (4.39 vs 4.44 in MOS).\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 10. DiSAN: Directional Self-Attention Network for RNN/CNN-Free Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient attention mechanisms with test-time training\"*\n\n*Tao Shen, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang, Tianyi Zhou, Shirui Pan, Guodong Long*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural nets (RNN) and convolutional neural nets (CNN) are widely\nused on NLP tasks to capture the long-term and local dependencies,\nrespectively. Attention mechanisms have recently attracted enormous interest\ndue to their highly parallelizable computation, significantly less training\ntime, and flexibility in modeling dependencies. We propose a novel attention\nmechanism in which the attention between elements from input sequence(s) is\ndirectional and multi-dimensional (i.e., feature-wise). A light-weight neural\nnet, \"Directional Self-Attention Network (DiSAN)\", is then proposed to learn\nsentence embedding, based solely on the proposed attention without any RNN/CNN\nstructure. DiSAN is only composed of a directional self-attention with temporal\norder encoded, followed by a multi-dimensional attention that compresses the\nsequence into a vector representation. Despite its simple form, DiSAN\noutperforms complicated RNN models on both prediction quality and time\nefficiency. It achieves the best test accuracy among all sentence encoding\nmethods and improves the most recent best result by 1.02% on the Stanford\nNatural Language Inference (SNLI) dataset, and shows state-of-the-art test\naccuracy on the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST), Multi-Genre natural language\ninference (MultiNLI), Sentences Involving Compositional Knowledge (SICK),\nCustomer Review, MPQA, TREC question-type classification and Subjectivity\n(SUBJ) datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2017-09-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating linear attention mechanisms into models like TTTLinear, which involve recursive updates and test-time training, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Stateful Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**: This is a promising approach as it introduces data-dependent gates to linear attention, enhancing its expressiveness. GLA can be integrated into RNNs to improve performance on long sequences and aid in length generalization. The work by Yang et al. (2023) provides a detailed implementation of GLA that could be adapted for stateful models like TTTLinear.\n\n### Linear Attention in Recurrent Networks\n\n- **Parallelizable RNNs**: Recent works have shown that traditional RNNs like LSTMs and GRUs can be modified to be trainable in parallel using the parallel prefix scan algorithm. This modification involves removing hidden state dependencies from the gates, making them compatible with linear attention mechanisms. The minimal versions of LSTMs and GRUs (minLSTMs and minGRUs) are particularly relevant as they use fewer parameters and are computationally efficient.\n\n- **Mamba Architecture**: Mamba is a modern RNN designed to match Transformer quality while maintaining RNN benefits. Its design principles, such as constant cache size and streamable inference, could be adapted to enhance the efficiency of TTTLinear. Mamba's architecture is particularly relevant when considering how to integrate linear attention into RNNs efficiently.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms with Test-Time Training\n\n- **Random Feature Attention (RFA)**: RFA is an efficient approximation to softmax attention that reduces temporal and spatial complexity from O(n\u00b2) to O(n), making it suitable for long-sequence modeling. This method could be integrated into TTTLinear to improve its efficiency during test-time training.\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Attention**: Techniques like those proposed by Rabe & Staats (2021) ensure that attention mechanisms require O(1) or O(log n) memory with respect to sequence length, which is crucial for models that adapt at test time. These methods are numerically stable and could be adapted for TTTLinear to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n### Numerical Stability and Training Dynamics\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: Ensuring numerical stability is critical when integrating linear attention into models like TTTLinear. Methods that emphasize numerical stability, such as those by Rabe & Staats, are essential to avoid introducing instability during training and inference.\n\n- **Training Dynamics**: The work by Ahn et al. (2023) on linear attention in understanding Transformer optimization provides insights into how linear attention can reproduce aspects of Transformer training dynamics. This understanding can be applied to ensure that integrating linear attention into TTTLinear does not adversely affect its training dynamics.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Recurrent Versions of Attention**: Recent papers have introduced recurrent versions of attention that can be computed in parallel, such as the work by Feng et al. (2024) which views softmax attention as an RNN. These models can be efficiently trained and could be integrated into TTTLinear to enhance its performance.\n\n- **State Updating Mechanisms**: To ensure compatibility with recursive updates, the attention mechanisms must be designed to accommodate stateful representations. This involves modifying the linear attention to update states in a manner consistent with the recursive update rules of TTTLinear.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Deep Dive into GLA Implementation**:\n  - Investigate the implementation details of GLA and how it can be integrated into TTTLinear, focusing on maintaining numerical stability and ensuring compatibility with state updates.\n\n- **Explore Stateful Linear Attention**:\n  - Search for research on integrating linear attention into RNNs that require stateful computations.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2.

These often involve complex sequential data\n\n[^0]processing tasks such as natural language understanding, conversational AI, time-series analysis, and indirectly sequential formats like images and graphs (Brown et al., 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Albalak et al., 2022). Predominant among these techniques include RNNs and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), each with specific benefits and drawbacks. RNNs require less memory, particularly for handling long sequences. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem and non-parallelizability in the time dimension during training, limiting their scalability (Hochreiter, 1998; Le and Zuidema, 2016). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-01.jpg?height=584&width=746&top_left_y=1647&top_left_x=1063)\n\nFigure 1: Average performance of RWKV models compared to transformers across twelve NLP tasks. For further details, see section 5 . Transformers emerged as a powerful alternative, adept at managing local and long-range dependencies and supporting parallelized training (Tay et al., 2022). Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022; Koco\u0144 et al., 2023),\n\n| Model | Time | Space |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Transformer | $O\\left(T^{2} d\\right)$ | $O\\left(T^{2}+T d\\right)$ |\n| Reformer | $O(T \\log T d)$ | $O(T \\log T+T d)$ |\n| Performer | $O\\left(T d^{2} \\log d\\right)$ | $O\\left(T d \\log d+d^{2} \\log d\\right)$ |\n| Linear Transformers | $O\\left(T d^{2}\\right)$ | $O\\left(T d+d^{2}\\right)$ |\n| AFT-full | $O\\left(T^{2} d\\right)$ | $O(T d)$ |\n| AFT-local | $O(T s d)$ | $O(T d)$ |\n| MEGA | $O(c T d)$ | $O(c d)$ |\n| RWKV (ours) | $O($ Td $)$ | $O(\\mathbf{d})$ |\n\nTable 1: Inference complexity comparison with different Transformers. Here $T$ denotes the sequence length, $d$ the feature dimension, $c$ is MEGA's chunk size of quadratic attention, and $s$ is the size of a local window for AFT. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) showcase the potential of Transformers in NLP. However, the self-attention mechanism's quadratic complexity makes it computationally and memory intensive for tasks involving long sequences and constrained resources. This has stimulated research to enhance Transformers' scalability, sometimes sacrificing some of their effectiveness (Wang et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2022a). To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model, combining the strengths of RNNs and Transformers while circumventing key drawbacks. RWKV alleviates memory bottleneck and quadratic scaling associated with Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with efficient linear scaling, while maintaining the expressive properties of the Transformer, such as parallelized training and robust scalability. RWKV reformulates the attention mechanism with a variant of linear attention, replacing traditional dot-product token interaction with more effective channel-directed attention. This implementation, without approximation, offers the lowest computational and memory complexity; see Table 1. The motivation behind RWKV is to balance computational efficiency with expressive capacity in neural networks. It offers a solution for handling large-scale models with billions of parameters, exhibiting competitive performance at a reduced computational cost. Experiments suggest RWKV addresses scaling and deployment challenges in AI, especially for sequential data processing, pointing towards more sustainable and efficient AI models. Our contributions in this paper are as follows:\n\n- The introduction of RWKV, a novel architec- ture combining RNNs and Transformer advantages while mitigating their limitations. - Detailed experiments demonstrating RWKV's performance and efficiency on benchmark datasets for large-scale models. - The release of pretrained models, from 169 million to 14 billion parameters, trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020; Biderman et al., 2022). ${ }^{2}$\n\n\n## 2 Background\n\nHere we briefly review the fundamentals of RNNs and Transformers. ### 2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n\nPopular RNN architectures such as LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRU (Chung et al., 2014) are characterized by the following formulation (shown for LSTM, others can be reasoned similarly):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{f} x_{t}+U_{f} h_{t-1}+b_{f}\\right) \\\\\ni_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{i} x_{t}+U_{i} h_{t-1}+b_{i}\\right) \\\\\no_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{o} x_{t}+U_{o} h_{t-1}+b_{o}\\right) \\\\\n\\tilde{c}_{t} & =\\sigma_{c}\\left(W_{c} x_{t}+U_{c} h_{t-1}+b_{c}\\right) \\\\\nc_{t} & =f_{t} \\odot c_{t-1}+i_{t} \\odot \\tilde{c}_{t} \\\\\nh_{t} & =o_{t} \\odot \\sigma_{h}\\left(c_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAlthough RNNs can be factored into two linear blocks ( $W$ and $U$ ) and an RNN-specific block (1)(6), as noted by Bradbury et al. (2017), the data dependency relying on previous time steps prohibits parallelizing these typical RNNs. ### 2.2 Transformers and AFT\n\nIntroduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), Transformers are a class of neural networks that have become the dominant architecture for several NLP tasks. Instead of operating on sequences step-by-step like RNNs, Transformers rely on attention mechanisms to capture relationships between all input and all output tokens:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(Q, K, V)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere the multi-headness and scaling factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$ is omitted for convenience. The core $Q K^{\\top}$ multiplication is an ensemble of pairwise attention scores\n\n[^1]between each token in a sequence, which can be decomposed as vector operations:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} e^{q_{t}^{\\top} k_{i}} \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} e^{q_{t}^{\\top} k_{i}}}\n$$\n\nAFT (Zhai et al., 2021), alternately formulates\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}^{+}(W, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} e^{w_{t, i}+k_{i}} \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} e^{w_{t, i}+k_{i}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left\\{w_{t, i}\\right\\} \\in R^{T \\times T}$ is the learned pair-wise position biases, and each $w_{t, i}$ is a scalar. Inspired by AFT, RWKV takes a similar approach. However, for simplicity, it modifies the interaction weights so that it can be transformed into an RNN. Each $w_{t, i}$ in RWKV is a channelwise time decay vector multiplied by the relative position and traced backward from current time as it decays:\n\n$$\nw_{t, i}=-(t-i) w\n$$\n\nwhere $w \\in\\left(R_{\\geq 0}\\right)^{d}$, with $d$ the number of channels. We require $w$ to be non-negative to ensure that $e^{w_{t, i}} \\leq 1$ and the per-channel weights decay backwards in time. ## 3 RWKV\n\nThe RWKV model architecture is defined by four fundamental elements that are intrinsic to the timemixing and channel-mixing blocks:\n\n- $R$ : The Receptance vector acts as the receiver of past information. - $W$ : The Weight signifies the positional weight decay vector, a trainable parameter within the model. - $K$ : The Key vector performs a role analogous to $K$ in traditional attention mechanisms. - $V$ : The Value vector functions similarly to $V$ in conventional attention processes. These core elements interact multiplicatively at each timestep, as depicted in Figure 2. ### 3.1 Architecture\n\nThe RWKV model is composed of stacked residual blocks. Each block consists of a time-mixing and a channel-mixing sub-block, embodying recurrent structures to leverage past information. This model uses a unique attention-like score update process, which includes a time-dependent\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-03.jpg?height=829&width=718&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=1086)\n\nFigure 2: Elements within an RWKV block (left) and the complete RWKV residual block, equipped with a final head for language modeling (right).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/48 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nFigures (2, 3, 3, 8).

Optimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (\"x-formers\") have been introduced to reduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other efficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021). Some recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al., 2019) share similarities with RWKV's chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient, their time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV achieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN. Attention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to scale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing attention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a computationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point where drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense. There has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and its successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work, Poli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the performance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021). Advances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto et al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al., 2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels. While QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as an attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN, RWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable. ## D Time-Mixing Block as an RNN Cell\n\nAs stated in 3.3, the RWKV time-mixing block can be formulated as an RNN, as the $W K V$ computation can be written in such a recursive form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0} & =0 \\\\\nw k v_{t} & =\\frac{a_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}} \\odot v_{t}}{b_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}}} \\\\\na_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot a_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}} \\odot v_{t} \\\\\nb_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot b_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe dataflow of the RNN-like time-mixing is shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our architectural design advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models, ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6 and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive performance across a wide variety of benchmarks.

Viewed from the perspective of induction heads, we theorize that this could allow for potential misleading matches to be pre-filtered out up front if they are not deemed useful for a given task. Improved WKV (Weighted Key-Value State) Modules The Eagle WKV attention sub-module is similar to the linear attention mechanism found in RetNet, but with learned per-channel decay rates replacing RetNet's static per-head decay rates. Our matrix-valued states feature a geometrically decaying $K^{\\mathrm{T}} V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(D / h) \\times(D / h)}$ term. This term can be intuitively understood as\na memory bank of values, with $K$ acting as an input gate for rows receiving the current token embedding's value. Each row of this state decays at its own rate via the learned parameter $w$. In Finch, we augment the learned token-shift parameters $\\mu_{r}, \\mu_{k}, \\mu_{\\nu}, \\mu_{w}$ and decay rate parameter $w$ with learned weight matrices. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), we provide two new learned weight matrices for each such parameter $y$, computing $y^{\\prime}=y+$ $\\tanh (x A) B$. This approach allows us to dynamically generate data-dependent token-shift amounts and decay rates with only modest increases in computational cost and model size. Extra SiLU Gating We remove the Sigmoid activation of receptance in favor of a new SiLU gate on the output of our linear attention calculation. Our receptance term now functions much like the query term in linear attention. ## Eagle and Finch Linear Attention Formula, PyTorch Recurrent Implementation\n\n```\n# r, k, v parameter shape (B,H,1,D//H)\n# w parameter of shape (1,H,1,D///H) for Eagle (RWKV-5)\n# (B,H,1,D//H) for Finch (RWKV-6)\n# u parameter of shape (1,H,1,D///H)\n# wkv_state parameter of shape (B,H,D//H,D//H)\ndef rwkv_5_or__6_recurrent(r, k, v, w, u, wkv_state):\n    kV = k.mT@ V\n    out = r @(wkv_state + u.mT * kv)\n    wkv_state = w.mT * wkv__state + kv\n    return out, wkv__state\n```\n\nEvolution of RWKV Formula in Expanded form Table 7 shows the expansion of terms at each sequence position to illustrate the progression of changes from RWKV-4 through RWKV-6.\n```\n\n#### 4.

[2017], with dot-product attention as the fundamental component, have emerged as dominant architectures in various artificial intelligence tasks, especially in language modeling Brown et al. [2020], Devlin et al. [2019]. By enabling direct interaction between every pair of elements in a sequence, Transformers overcome the limitations of long-range dependencies and enable parallelization, which make them validly scale up to efficiently learn and exhibit emergent abilities Kaplan et al. [2020]. However, Transformers face the challenge of high computational costs in dot-product attention operations, which scale quadratically with the length of the sequence. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) Hochreiter and Schmidhuber [1997], Chung et al. [2014] naturally offer low computational costs with linearly scaling in space and time requirements. The reason is that RNNs generate the currently hidden states $h_{t}$ giving the current input and previous hidden state $h_{t-1}$ at position $t$. Unfortunately, this sequential nature leads to RNNs being unable to parallel and bear the gradient vanishing problem, with the result that they lack scalability Hochreiter [1998], Le and Zuidema [2016]. To achieve parallelization and low computational costs, the architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023], redesigns the tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021] as a linear attention mechanism with a time-sequential mode similar to RNNs. Regretfully, the RWKV cannot afford to capture long-range dependencies over long sequences since the information would be lost in the sequential flow, in contrast to standard attentions Bahdanau et al. [2016]. In this paper, we propose the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture based on RWKV for discharging long-range interactions and performing efficient information flow in which mediums are incorporated. Especially, the RRWKV model is to obtain the appropriate messages specifically addressing the issues of information redundancy that may occur with the attention mechanisms and information loss with the RWKV. ## 2 Background\n\nIn this section, we will briefly introduce the development history of RWKV from the standard transformer architectures and then analyse the reasons of lacking long-range dependencies in RWKV. On the one hand, we discuss dot-product\n\n[^0]attention and tensor-product attention in standard transformer architectures. On the other hand, we uncover the underlying ideas of two blocks in RWKV and the deficiencies they bring. ### 2.1 Standard Transformer Architecture\n\nHere we simply review the core components of Transformers, attention mechanisms. Attention mechanisms leverage query, key, and value components to facilitate information selection. The query encapsulates the context of a specific matter, while the keys and values correspond to the input elements. By evaluating compatibility between the query and each key, attention weights are assigned to the corresponding values. These weighted values are then summed, enabling the matter to incorporate pertinent information from values. ### 2.1.1 Dot-Product Attention\n\nIn dot-product attention Vaswani et al. [2017], attention weights are determined by taking the dot product between the query and key vectors. The dot-product serves as a measure of similarity and represents the compatibility between the query and key. Mathematically, for a given sequence of tokens, the dot-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right) \\cdot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(q_{t}^{T} k_{i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere $q$ represents the query vector, $k$ represents the key vector, $v$ represents the value vector, and scaling factor is neglected for convenience. Dot-product attention effectively implements the core idea of attention mechanisms and allows for parallel computation at each time step. However, it is constrained by the quadratic calculation and storage requirements of the similarity matrix, limiting its capabilities. ### 2.1.2 Tensor-Product Attention\n\nIn tensor-product attention Zhai et al. [2021], the determination of attention weights is based on the key vectors and position biases, replacing the conventional use of key and query vectors Bahdanau et al. [2016], Vaswani et al. [2017]. The tensor-product performs the role of feature interaction between the query and the weighted sum value. Correspondingly, the tensor-product attention can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Atten}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right) \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} \\exp \\left(k_{i}+w_{t, i}\\right)}\n$$\n\nwhere each $w_{t, i}$ is a learned scalar which introduces an offset in the key vector $i$. This implies that key vectors can be adjusted to be more suitable for the specific query at time $t$. Although the tensor-product attention still retains the same high computational costs as the dot-product attention, it can be transformed into a linear complexity operation by disregarding the position biases. ### 2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Architecture\n\nHere we briefly analyse the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture which combines the sequential mode of RNNs and then achieves the linear calculation and storage costs.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 20 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"RWKV architecture\", \"linear attention in test-time training\", \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

Recently, attention-based networks, such as the Vision Transformer, have also become popular. In this paper we show that while convolutions and attention are both sufficient for good performance, neither of them are necessary. We present MLP-Mixer, an architecture based exclusively on multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs). MLP-Mixer contains two types of layers: one with MLPs applied independently to image patches (i.e.\"mixing\"the per-location features), and one with MLPs applied across patches (i.e.\"mixing\"spatial information). When trained on large datasets, or with modern regularization schemes, MLP-Mixer attains competitive scores on image classification benchmarks, with pre-training and inference cost comparable to state-of-the-art models. We hope that these results spark further research beyond the realms of well established CNNs and Transformers.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 2211  (*Influential: 328*)\n\n#### 4.

Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in test-time training\"*\n\n*Ofir Press, Noah A. Smith, M. Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though it finds that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation, and introduces a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi).\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 552  (*Influential: 80*)\n\n#### 6.

In this work we empirically investigate several questions related to the efficacy of dropout, specifically as it concerns networks employing the popular rectified linear activation function. We investigate the quality of the test time weight-scaling inference procedure by evaluating the geometric average exactly in small models, as well as compare the performance of the geometric mean to the arithmetic mean more commonly employed by ensemble techniques. We explore the effect of tied weights on the ensemble interpretation by training ensembles of masked networks without tied weights. Finally, we investigate an alternative criterion based on a biased estimator of the maximum likelihood ensemble gradient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 103  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. HyperAttention: Long-context Attention in Near-Linear Time\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Insu Han, Rajesh Jayaram, Amin Karbasi, V. Mirrokni, David P. Woodruff, A. Zandieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention is presented to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models, and is able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention. We validate the empirical performance of HyperAttention on a variety of different long-context length datasets. For example, HyperAttention makes the inference time of ChatGLM2 50\\% faster on 32k context length while perplexity increases from 5.6 to 6.3. On larger context length, e.g., 131k, with causal masking, HyperAttention offers 5-fold speedup on a single attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput\n  tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV architecture\"*\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall,\nthe ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context.\nHowever, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during\ninference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we\nexplore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing\nmemory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and\ntheory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a\nmodel's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to\nattention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but\nstruggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and\nsliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention\nfeature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier\nof the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention\non one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in test-time training\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in test-time training\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

This paper introduces Vision-RWKV (VRWKV), a model adapted from the RWKV model used in the NLP field with necessary modifications for vision tasks. Similar to the Vision Transformer (ViT), our model is designed to efficiently handle sparse inputs and demonstrate robust global processing capabilities, while also scaling up effectively, accommodating both large-scale parameters and extensive datasets. Its distinctive advantage lies in its reduced spatial aggregation complexity, which renders it exceptionally adept at processing high-resolution images seamlessly, eliminating the necessity for windowing operations. Our evaluations demonstrate that VRWKV surpasses ViT's performance in image classification and has significantly faster speeds and lower memory usage processing high-resolution inputs. In dense prediction tasks, it outperforms window-based models, maintaining comparable speeds. These results highlight VRWKV's potential as a more efficient alternative for visual perception tasks.

The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. Giraffe: Adventures in Expanding Context Lengths in LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"linear attention in test-time training\"*\n\n*Siddartha Naidu, Arvind Sundararajan, Samuel Dooley, Manley Roberts, Deep Karkhanis, Arka Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern large language models (LLMs) that rely on attention mechanisms are typically trained with fixed context lengths which enforce upper limits on the length of input sequences that they can handle at evaluation time. To use these models on sequences longer than the train-time context length, one might employ techniques from the growing family of context length extrapolation methods -- most of which focus on modifying the system of positional encodings used in the attention mechanism to indicate where tokens or activations are located in the input sequence. We conduct a wide survey of existing methods of context length extrapolation on a base LLaMA or LLaMA 2 model, and introduce some of our own design as well -- in particular, a new truncation strategy for modifying the basis for the position encoding. We test these methods using three new evaluation tasks (FreeFormQA, AlteredNumericQA, and LongChat-Lines) as well as perplexity, which we find to be less fine-grained as a measure of long context performance of LLMs. We release the three tasks publicly as datasets on HuggingFace. We discover that linear scaling is the best method for extending context length, and show that further gains can be achieved by using longer scales at evaluation time. We also discover promising extrapolation capabilities in the truncated basis. To support further research in this area, we release three new 13B parameter long-context models which we call Giraffe: 4k and 16k context models trained from base LLaMA-13B, and a 32k context model trained from base LLaMA2-13B. We also release the code to replicate our results.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. Longformer: The Long-Document Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Iz Beltagy, Matthew E. Peters, Arman Cohan*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models are unable to process long sequences due to their self-attention operation, which scales quadratically with the sequence length. To address this limitation, we introduce the Longformer with an attention mechanism that scales linearly with sequence length, making it easy to process documents of thousands of tokens or longer. Longformer's attention mechanism is a drop-in replacement for the standard self-attention and combines a local windowed attention with a task motivated global attention. Following prior work on long-sequence transformers, we evaluate Longformer on character-level language modeling and achieve state-of-the-art results on text8 and enwik8. In contrast to most prior work, we also pretrain Longformer and finetune it on a variety of downstream tasks. Our pretrained Longformer consistently outperforms RoBERTa on long document tasks and sets new state-of-the-art results on WikiHop and TriviaQA. We finally introduce the Longformer-Encoder-Decoder (LED), a Longformer variant for supporting long document generative sequence-to-sequence tasks, and demonstrate its effectiveness on the arXiv summarization dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 6. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"stateful linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating linear attention into models with stateful recursive updates and test-time training, particularly focusing on the RWKV architecture and similar models, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## RWKV Architecture\n\n- The RWKV model is a significant example of how linear attention can be integrated into a model that combines the efficiency of Transformers with the recursive updates of RNNs.

The work by Ahn et al. (2023) provides insights into how linear attention can reproduce key aspects of Transformer training dynamics, which can be applied to TTTLinear[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n\n- **Deep Dive into RWKV:**\n  - Study the RWKV architecture in detail to understand how it combines RNNs with linear attention and assess the feasibility of integrating these principles into TTTLinear.\n\n- **Implementation of Gated Linear Attention:**\n  - Examine the specific mechanisms of GLA, including data-dependent gates and hardware-efficient training algorithms, and determine how GLA can be incorporated into TTTLinear.\n\n- **Preventing Information Leakage:**\n  - Analyze methods to prevent information leakage, such as local convolutional augmentation, and ensure these methods do not interfere with test-time training dynamics.\n\n- **Validation and Benchmarking:**\n  - Plan experiments to validate that integrating linear attention into TTTLinear maintains numerical stability and does not adversely affect training dynamics. Compare the performance and efficiency of the modified TTTLinear with existing baselines on standard datasets.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can effectively integrate linear attention into TTTLinear, enhancing its efficiency, scalability, and test-time adaptation capabilities while maintaining numerical stability and optimal training dynamics.\n",

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and the most useful information gathered from the analysis:\n\n### Key Goals and Objectives\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Improve computational efficiency and scalability, especially for handling long sequences.\n- **Expressiveness and Adaptability**: Maintain or enhance the model's expressive power and adaptability during test time.\n- **Compatibility with Test-Time Training**: Ensure the modifications are compatible with test-time training and recursive updates.\n- **Numerical Stability**: Prevent information leakage and ensure numerical stability.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Implement hardware-efficient algorithms.\n\n### Useful Insights and Techniques\n\n#### Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- **RWKV Architecture**:\n  - Integrates linear attention into an RNN-like architecture, allowing for efficient training and inference with stateful representations.\n  - Replaces traditional attention with a linear attention that decays over time, avoiding quadratic complexity.\n\n#### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n- **Data-Dependent Gates**:\n  - Enhances expressiveness by modulating attention weights based on input data while maintaining linear complexity.\n- **Length Generalization**:\n  - Effective in generalizing to much longer sequences than those seen during training.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementation**:\n  - Uses the FLASHLinearAttention algorithm, which trades off memory movement against parallelizability, making it faster than standard attention mechanisms.\n\n#### Preventing Information Leakage\n- **Local Convolutional Augmentation**:\n  - Prevents information leakage during autoregressive decoding by introducing local convolutional augmentations.\n\n#### Numerical Stability\n- **Sparse Attention with Linear Units (ReLA)**:\n  - Replaces softmax with ReLU to introduce sparsity and maintain numerical stability.\n\n#### Training Dynamics\n- **Linear Attention Models**:\n  - Can retain the training dynamics of standard Transformers, which is crucial for ensuring that the modifications do not introduce numerical instability.\n\n### Implementation Strategy\n\n#### Designing the Modified TTTLinear GAU\n- **Integrate Linear Attention**:\n  - Formulate a detailed design using either the RWKV mechanism or GLA, ensuring compatibility with test-time training and recursive updates.\n- **Address Potential Challenges**:\n  - Plan to prevent information leakage using local convolutional augmentations.\n  - Ensure numerical stability through methods like ReLA or other appropriate activation functions.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**:\n  - Consider using hardware-efficient algorithms like FLASHLinearAttention for practical implementation.\n\n#### Compatibility and Locality\n- **Maintain Locality**:\n  - Outline how the proposed changes fit into the GAU hierarchy, affecting as few units as possible to maintain locality.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n#### Detailed Design and Implementation\n- **Consolidate Insights**:\n  - Consolidate all insights into a coherent proposal that aligns with the guidelines, focusing on local modifications and evolutionary improvement.\n- **Prototype and Test**:\n  - Implement the proposed design and test it on various benchmarks to evaluate its performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### References\n\nThe references provided are crucial for detailed implementation and understanding the underlying mechanisms:\n\n1. **RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era**\n2. **Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training**\n3. **When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding**\n4. **Linear Attention Is (Maybe) All You Need (to Understand Transformer Optimization)**\n5. **Sparse Attention with Linear Units**\n\nBy focusing on these key points and techniques, the researcher can design a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates linear attention mechanisms efficiently, maintains compatibility with test-time training, and enhances the model's expressiveness and scalability.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/51 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n$w / \\mathrm{m}$. and $w / o m$. denotes using FLASHLINEARATTENTION with or without materialization of hidden states in HBM. and a pure PyTorch (i.e., I/O-unaware) implementation of chunkwise linear attention, showing the benefits of I/O-awareness. ## 4 Gated Linear Attention\n\nThe linear recurrence in Eq. 1 does not have a decay term or a forget gate, which has been shown to be crucial in RNNs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014; van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018). The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form. GLA has a 2D forget gate $\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\in(0,1)^{d_{k} \\times d_{v}}$ that varies over time:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\mathbf{G}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere we now allow the hidden state to have varying dimensions. This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1.

However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Eagle and Finch: RWKV with Matrix-Valued States and Dynamic Recurrence (Avg.

Our architectural design advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models, ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6 and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive performance across a wide variety of benchmarks.

Viewed from the perspective of induction heads, we theorize that this could allow for potential misleading matches to be pre-filtered out up front if they are not deemed useful for a given task. Improved WKV (Weighted Key-Value State) Modules The Eagle WKV attention sub-module is similar to the linear attention mechanism found in RetNet, but with learned per-channel decay rates replacing RetNet's static per-head decay rates. Our matrix-valued states feature a geometrically decaying $K^{\\mathrm{T}} V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(D / h) \\times(D / h)}$ term. This term can be intuitively understood as\na memory bank of values, with $K$ acting as an input gate for rows receiving the current token embedding's value. Each row of this state decays at its own rate via the learned parameter $w$. In Finch, we augment the learned token-shift parameters $\\mu_{r}, \\mu_{k}, \\mu_{\\nu}, \\mu_{w}$ and decay rate parameter $w$ with learned weight matrices. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), we provide two new learned weight matrices for each such parameter $y$, computing $y^{\\prime}=y+$ $\\tanh (x A) B$. This approach allows us to dynamically generate data-dependent token-shift amounts and decay rates with only modest increases in computational cost and model size. Extra SiLU Gating We remove the Sigmoid activation of receptance in favor of a new SiLU gate on the output of our linear attention calculation.

Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a non-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product attention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling with sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/11 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n### 2.2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Chung et al. [2014] are designed to handle sequential data by incorporating a mechanism that enables information to propagate from one step to the next. This process can be succinctly expressed using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=g\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\tilde{x}_{t}=f\\left(x_{t}, h_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, the functions $g$ and $f$ refer to the reset gate and update gate, respectively. The reset gate function, $g$, determines the extent to which the previous state, $h_{t-1}$, is reset or forgotten based on the current input, $x_{t}$. Subsequently, the update gate function, $f$, governs the proportion of the current input $x_{t}$ and the hidden current state $h_{t}$ that contribute to the computation of the output, $\\tilde{x}_{t}$. By utilizing these reset and update gates, RNNs effectively capture the temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. ### 2.2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Model\n\nReceptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023] model captures and propagates information in a sequential or auto-regressive mode Graves [2014] as integrating the capabilities of RNNs and attention mechanisms. This model consists of two core blocks, namely the time-mix block and the channel-mix block. Time-Mix Block This block aims to enhance the modeling of dependencies and patterns within a sequence by replacing the conventional weighted sum calculation in attention mechanisms with hidden states. By incorporating hidden states, the time-mix block can effectively propagate and update information across sequential steps. The calculations involved in this block can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{q} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{q}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{q} \\\\\nk_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{k} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{k}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{k} \\\\\nv_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{v} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{v}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{v} \\\\\no_{t} & =\\left(\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)\\right) \\cdot W_{o}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn these formulas, the representations of $q_{t}, k_{t}$, and $v_{t}$ are calculated by linearly interpolating between the current input and the input at the previous time for coherent and fluent token representations. The parameter $\\mu$ denotes the token shift, which determines the interpolation weight. Similar to tensor-product attention, this block applies a non-linear activation function $\\sigma$ to $q_{t}$ and combines it with the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ using element-wise multiplication as an update gate. Furthermore, the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ serve as both the reset gate and a replacement for the traditional weighted sum value. This process of calculating the hidden states can be described by the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0}, p_{0} & =0,0,0 \\\\\np_{t} & =\\max \\left(p_{t-1}, k_{t}\\right) \\\\\nh_{t} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot a_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot v_{t}}{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot b_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the position biases are omitted in these equations for convenience, and the division is element-wise division. Intuitively, the hidden states are computed recursively, and the vector $p$ serves as the reset gate in this process. Channel-Mix Block This block is to amplify the outputs of time-mix block, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{r} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{r}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{r} \\\\\nz_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{z} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{z}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{z} \\\\\n\\tilde{x}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(r_{t}\\right) \\odot\\left(\\max \\left(z_{t}, 0\\right)^{2} \\cdot W_{v}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere squared ReLU activation So et al. [2022] is adopted. In these equations, the output $o_{t}$ contains the history information up to time $t$, and the interpolation weight $\\mu$ is derived from both $o_{t}$ and $o_{t-1}$ same as in time-mix block. Intuitively, this amplification process enhances the representations of historical information. In sum, the RWKV model has achieved the parallelization in a time-parallel mode due to the tensor-product Lei et al. [2018] and contains the linear computational costs for discarding similarity matrix.\n```\n\n#### 4. A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention gated linear attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many advances have been made with other transformer architectures and training configurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here, we introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe that is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture incorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear Units (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision LayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block. The training recipe includes a 30% masking ratio for the Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective, bfloat16 precision, and vocabulary size optimized for GPU throughput, in addition to best-practices from RoBERTa and other encoder models. When pretrained from scratch on the C4 dataset, this base model achieves a downstream average GLUE (dev) score of 79.6 in 1.13 hours on 8 A100 80 GB GPUs at a cost of roughly $20. We plot extensive accuracy vs. pretraining speed Pareto curves and show that MosaicBERT base and large are consistently Pareto optimal when compared to a competitive BERT base and large.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention gated linear attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention gated linear attention*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Smith, Soham De*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have fast inference and scale efficiently on long sequences, but they are difficult to train and hard to scale. We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and the RWKV architecture, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\nLinear attention models significantly reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention.

The lack of a decay term makes it difficult for a model to \"forget\" information, and has been hypothesized to be partially responsible for the instability of linear attention in long-context tasks (Buckman \\& Gelada, 2024). Recent works (Sun et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023b) obtain better performance through incorporating a global, non-data-dependent decay factor ${ }^{3} \\gamma \\in(0,1)$ into linear attention: $\\mathbf{S}_{t}=\\gamma \\mathbf{S}_{t-1}+\\boldsymbol{k}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{v}_{t}$. The use of a single $\\gamma$ is designed to preserve the attention-style parallel form for efficient training. In this work, we consider a data-dependent gating mechanism for linear attention. We show that despite having a more expressive gating factor, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) layer still admits a hardware-efficient chunkwise form for efficient training. ### 4.1 Recurrent and Parallel Form of GLA\n\nRecurrent form.

This Hadamard product-based recurrent form is very general and encompasses many recent RNNs with 2D hidden states, as listed in Table 1.

Mao (2022) propose a more efficient outer-product-based low-rank parameterization $\\left(\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\beta}_{t}\\right)$, which requires $d \\cdot d_{v}+d \\cdot d_{k}$ parameters. ${ }^{4}$\n\nIn Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), $\\mathbf{G}_{t}$ is obtained by combining a data-independent learnable matrix $\\boldsymbol{A}$ with a data-dependent vector $\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}_{t}$, which allows the matrix to be full rank. However, this prevents the use of tensor cores because it cannot be reformulated into a matrix-multiply format, as discussed in Dao \\& Gu (2024). The lack of a compact matrix-multiply form necessitates the materialization of each time step's hidden states. To reduce high I/O costs, Gu \\& Dao (2023) develop a hardware-aware algorithm that materializes the hidden states exclusively in SRAM rather than in HBM. Due to limited SRAM capacity, this approach cannot scale to larger hidden states, which, as we will show in our experiments, results in suboptimal performance on recall-intensive tasks. Mamba-2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024) addresses this limitation with a more restricted gating mechanism: $\\mathbf{G}_{t}=\\gamma_{t} \\mathbf{1}^{T} \\mathbf{1}$, where $\\gamma_{t} \\in(0,1)$ is a scalar, which makes it possible to to reformulate the recurrence in matrix-multiply form, enabling the use of tensor cores and larger state sizes. This scalar data-dependent gating is also used in Peng et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/51 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n# Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training \n\nSonglin Yang ${ }^{1 *}$ Bailin Wang ${ }^{1 *}$ Yikang Shen ${ }^{2}$ Rameswar Panda ${ }^{2}$ Yoon Kim ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token.

The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention RWKV*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 3.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

However, these models, predominantly based on transformers, are difficult to scale to long documents as their attention layers have quadratic complexity in the sequence length. Recent efforts on efficient attention improve scalability, but their effect on document translation remains unexplored. In this work, we investigate the efficacy of a recent linear attention model by Peng et al. (2021) on document translation and augment it with a sentential gate to promote a recency inductive bias. We evaluate the model on IWSLT 2015 and OpenSubtitles 2018 against the transformer, demonstrating substantially increased decoding speed on long sequences with similar or better BLEU scores.

Linearizing Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention RWKV*\n\n*Thomas Kollar, Adrien Gaidon, Achal Dave, Kushal Arora, Sedrick Keh, Igor Vasiljevic, Jean Mercat*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear transformers have emerged as a subquadratic-time alternative to softmax attention and have garnered significant interest due to their fixed-size recurrent state that lowers inference cost. However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models. Our code and models can be found at https://github.com/TRI-ML/linear_open_lm.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and concepts from the RWKV architecture, here are some key points and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n\n- GLA involves adding a gating mechanism to linear attention, similar to those used in traditional RNNs. This allows the model to forget past information and focus on local patterns, which can enhance efficiency and expressiveness. The gating mechanism converts each input into a scalar between [0, 1] and expands it into a forget matrix, enabling the model to selectively retain or discard information.\n\n- The integration of GLA in autoregressive models has shown significant performance gains, particularly in capturing local patterns and improving generalization on time-varying distributions. For instance, the ARMA attention mechanism, which includes a moving-average term, significantly improved the performance of gated linear attention models.\n\n## RWKV Architecture\n\n- The RWKV (Recurrent Weighted Kernel Vision) architecture combines the benefits of RNNs and Transformers, particularly by using linear attention mechanisms. RWKV models use a linear RNN-like structure with a hidden state vector, which simplifies the attention computations and makes them more efficient. This approach is favored for its simplicity and efficiency, especially in recent works.\n\n- RWKV models leverage element-wise linear attention, which can be seen as a linear RNN with a dimensional hidden state vector. This structure enables element-wise computations and is efficient for handling long sequences.\n\n## Integration and Efficiency\n\n- The SeerAttention mechanism, although not specifically focused on GLA or RWKV, introduces a learnable gate to adaptively select significant blocks in the attention map, reducing computational complexity. This concept can be adapted to GLA and RWKV architectures to further enhance efficiency by learning block-level sparsity, which balances accuracy and speedup.\n\n- Integrating GLA into the RWKV architecture could potentially enhance the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently. The linear attention mechanism in RWKV, combined with the gating mechanism of GLA, could improve both computational efficiency and the model's expressiveness in capturing long-range dependencies.\n\n## Test-Time Training (TTT) and Adaptability\n\n- The TTT capability is crucial for models that need to adapt quickly to new data or contexts. The integration of GLA and RWKV concepts should be designed to maintain or enhance this adaptability. The use of learnable gates and linear attention mechanisms can facilitate this by allowing the model to dynamically adjust its attention patterns during test-time training.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The proposed integration is expected to improve computational efficiency and scalability. Linear attention mechanisms reduce the complexity from quadratic to linear, which is a significant improvement for handling long sequences. Additionally, the gating mechanism can help in focusing on relevant information, further reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Comparison and Novelty\n\n- The specific integration of GLA and RWKV concepts into the TTTLinear GAU appears to be novel, especially in the context of test-time training and linear attention mechanisms. While similar designs like TTTLinear-AuxAct exist, the focus on GLA and RWKV for linear attention and test-time training capabilities is unique and warrants further investigation to assess its potential impact on model performance.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researchers can design an autoregressive language model that leverages the efficiency of linear attention, the adaptability of test-time training, and the expressiveness of gated mechanisms, potentially leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

These often involve complex sequential data\n\n[^0]processing tasks such as natural language understanding, conversational AI, time-series analysis, and indirectly sequential formats like images and graphs (Brown et al., 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Albalak et al., 2022). Predominant among these techniques include RNNs and Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), each with specific benefits and drawbacks. RNNs require less memory, particularly for handling long sequences. However, they suffer from the vanishing gradient problem and non-parallelizability in the time dimension during training, limiting their scalability (Hochreiter, 1998; Le and Zuidema, 2016). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-01.jpg?height=584&width=746&top_left_y=1647&top_left_x=1063)\n\nFigure 1: Average performance of RWKV models compared to transformers across twelve NLP tasks. For further details, see section 5 . Transformers emerged as a powerful alternative, adept at managing local and long-range dependencies and supporting parallelized training (Tay et al., 2022). Models such as GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020), ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2022; Koco\u0144 et al., 2023),\n\n| Model | Time | Space |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Transformer | $O\\left(T^{2} d\\right)$ | $O\\left(T^{2}+T d\\right)$ |\n| Reformer | $O(T \\log T d)$ | $O(T \\log T+T d)$ |\n| Performer | $O\\left(T d^{2} \\log d\\right)$ | $O\\left(T d \\log d+d^{2} \\log d\\right)$ |\n| Linear Transformers | $O\\left(T d^{2}\\right)$ | $O\\left(T d+d^{2}\\right)$ |\n| AFT-full | $O\\left(T^{2} d\\right)$ | $O(T d)$ |\n| AFT-local | $O(T s d)$ | $O(T d)$ |\n| MEGA | $O(c T d)$ | $O(c d)$ |\n| RWKV (ours) | $O($ Td $)$ | $O(\\mathbf{d})$ |\n\nTable 1: Inference complexity comparison with different Transformers. Here $T$ denotes the sequence length, $d$ the feature dimension, $c$ is MEGA's chunk size of quadratic attention, and $s$ is the size of a local window for AFT. LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and Chinchilla (Hoffmann et al., 2022) showcase the potential of Transformers in NLP. However, the self-attention mechanism's quadratic complexity makes it computationally and memory intensive for tasks involving long sequences and constrained resources. This has stimulated research to enhance Transformers' scalability, sometimes sacrificing some of their effectiveness (Wang et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020; Dao et al., 2022a). To tackle these challenges, we introduce the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model, combining the strengths of RNNs and Transformers while circumventing key drawbacks. RWKV alleviates memory bottleneck and quadratic scaling associated with Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with efficient linear scaling, while maintaining the expressive properties of the Transformer, such as parallelized training and robust scalability. RWKV reformulates the attention mechanism with a variant of linear attention, replacing traditional dot-product token interaction with more effective channel-directed attention. This implementation, without approximation, offers the lowest computational and memory complexity; see Table 1. The motivation behind RWKV is to balance computational efficiency with expressive capacity in neural networks. It offers a solution for handling large-scale models with billions of parameters, exhibiting competitive performance at a reduced computational cost. Experiments suggest RWKV addresses scaling and deployment challenges in AI, especially for sequential data processing, pointing towards more sustainable and efficient AI models. Our contributions in this paper are as follows:\n\n- The introduction of RWKV, a novel architec- ture combining RNNs and Transformer advantages while mitigating their limitations. - Detailed experiments demonstrating RWKV's performance and efficiency on benchmark datasets for large-scale models. - The release of pretrained models, from 169 million to 14 billion parameters, trained on the Pile (Gao et al., 2020; Biderman et al., 2022). ${ }^{2}$\n\n\n## 2 Background\n\nHere we briefly review the fundamentals of RNNs and Transformers. ### 2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)\n\nPopular RNN architectures such as LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) and GRU (Chung et al., 2014) are characterized by the following formulation (shown for LSTM, others can be reasoned similarly):\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{f} x_{t}+U_{f} h_{t-1}+b_{f}\\right) \\\\\ni_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{i} x_{t}+U_{i} h_{t-1}+b_{i}\\right) \\\\\no_{t} & =\\sigma_{g}\\left(W_{o} x_{t}+U_{o} h_{t-1}+b_{o}\\right) \\\\\n\\tilde{c}_{t} & =\\sigma_{c}\\left(W_{c} x_{t}+U_{c} h_{t-1}+b_{c}\\right) \\\\\nc_{t} & =f_{t} \\odot c_{t-1}+i_{t} \\odot \\tilde{c}_{t} \\\\\nh_{t} & =o_{t} \\odot \\sigma_{h}\\left(c_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAlthough RNNs can be factored into two linear blocks ( $W$ and $U$ ) and an RNN-specific block (1)(6), as noted by Bradbury et al. (2017), the data dependency relying on previous time steps prohibits parallelizing these typical RNNs. ### 2.2 Transformers and AFT\n\nIntroduced by Vaswani et al. (2017), Transformers are a class of neural networks that have become the dominant architecture for several NLP tasks. Instead of operating on sequences step-by-step like RNNs, Transformers rely on attention mechanisms to capture relationships between all input and all output tokens:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(Q, K, V)=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere the multi-headness and scaling factor $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}$ is omitted for convenience. The core $Q K^{\\top}$ multiplication is an ensemble of pairwise attention scores\n\n[^1]between each token in a sequence, which can be decomposed as vector operations:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(Q, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} e^{q_{t}^{\\top} k_{i}} \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{T} e^{q_{t}^{\\top} k_{i}}}\n$$\n\nAFT (Zhai et al., 2021), alternately formulates\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}^{+}(W, K, V)_{t}=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} e^{w_{t, i}+k_{i}} \\odot v_{i}}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t} e^{w_{t, i}+k_{i}}}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\left\\{w_{t, i}\\right\\} \\in R^{T \\times T}$ is the learned pair-wise position biases, and each $w_{t, i}$ is a scalar. Inspired by AFT, RWKV takes a similar approach. However, for simplicity, it modifies the interaction weights so that it can be transformed into an RNN. Each $w_{t, i}$ in RWKV is a channelwise time decay vector multiplied by the relative position and traced backward from current time as it decays:\n\n$$\nw_{t, i}=-(t-i) w\n$$\n\nwhere $w \\in\\left(R_{\\geq 0}\\right)^{d}$, with $d$ the number of channels. We require $w$ to be non-negative to ensure that $e^{w_{t, i}} \\leq 1$ and the per-channel weights decay backwards in time. ## 3 RWKV\n\nThe RWKV model architecture is defined by four fundamental elements that are intrinsic to the timemixing and channel-mixing blocks:\n\n- $R$ : The Receptance vector acts as the receiver of past information. - $W$ : The Weight signifies the positional weight decay vector, a trainable parameter within the model. - $K$ : The Key vector performs a role analogous to $K$ in traditional attention mechanisms. - $V$ : The Value vector functions similarly to $V$ in conventional attention processes. These core elements interact multiplicatively at each timestep, as depicted in Figure 2. ### 3.1 Architecture\n\nThe RWKV model is composed of stacked residual blocks. Each block consists of a time-mixing and a channel-mixing sub-block, embodying recurrent structures to leverage past information. This model uses a unique attention-like score update process, which includes a time-dependent\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_adcbc90dd79b80c126adg-03.jpg?height=829&width=718&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=1086)\n\nFigure 2: Elements within an RWKV block (left) and the complete RWKV residual block, equipped with a final head for language modeling (right).\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our architectural design advancements include multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improve expressivity while maintaining the inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. We introduce a new multilingual corpus with 1.12 trillion tokens and a fast tokenizer based on greedy matching for enhanced multilinguality. We trained four Eagle models, ranging from 0.46 to 7.5 billion parameters, and two Finch models with 1.6 and 3.1 billion parameters and find that they achieve competitive performance across a wide variety of benchmarks.

Viewed from the perspective of induction heads, we theorize that this could allow for potential misleading matches to be pre-filtered out up front if they are not deemed useful for a given task. Improved WKV (Weighted Key-Value State) Modules The Eagle WKV attention sub-module is similar to the linear attention mechanism found in RetNet, but with learned per-channel decay rates replacing RetNet's static per-head decay rates. Our matrix-valued states feature a geometrically decaying $K^{\\mathrm{T}} V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(D / h) \\times(D / h)}$ term. This term can be intuitively understood as\na memory bank of values, with $K$ acting as an input gate for rows receiving the current token embedding's value. Each row of this state decays at its own rate via the learned parameter $w$. In Finch, we augment the learned token-shift parameters $\\mu_{r}, \\mu_{k}, \\mu_{\\nu}, \\mu_{w}$ and decay rate parameter $w$ with learned weight matrices. Inspired by Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2022), we provide two new learned weight matrices for each such parameter $y$, computing $y^{\\prime}=y+$ $\\tanh (x A) B$. This approach allows us to dynamically generate data-dependent token-shift amounts and decay rates with only modest increases in computational cost and model size. Extra SiLU Gating We remove the Sigmoid activation of receptance in favor of a new SiLU gate on the output of our linear attention calculation. Our receptance term now functions much like the query term in linear attention. ## Eagle and Finch Linear Attention Formula, PyTorch Recurrent Implementation\n\n```\n# r, k, v parameter shape (B,H,1,D//H)\n# w parameter of shape (1,H,1,D///H) for Eagle (RWKV-5)\n# (B,H,1,D//H) for Finch (RWKV-6)\n# u parameter of shape (1,H,1,D///H)\n# wkv_state parameter of shape (B,H,D//H,D//H)\ndef rwkv_5_or__6_recurrent(r, k, v, w, u, wkv_state):\n    kV = k.mT@ V\n    out = r @(wkv_state + u.mT * kv)\n    wkv_state = w.mT * wkv__state + kv\n    return out, wkv__state\n```\n\nEvolution of RWKV Formula in Expanded form Table 7 shows the expansion of terms at each sequence position to illustrate the progression of changes from RWKV-4 through RWKV-6.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Recently, the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) architecture follows a non-transformer architecture to eliminate the drawbacks of dot-product attention, where memory and computational complexity exhibits quadratic scaling with sequence length. Although RWKV has exploited a linearly tensor-product attention mechanism and achieved parallelized computations by deploying the time-sequential mode, it fails to capture long-range dependencies because of its limitation on looking back at previous information, compared with full information obtained by direct interactions in the standard transformer. Therefore, the paper devises the Retrospected Receptance Weighted Key Value (RRWKV) architecture via incorporating the retrospecting ability into the RWKV to effectively absorb information, which maintains memory and computational efficiency as well.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/11 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n### 2.2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Chung et al. [2014] are designed to handle sequential data by incorporating a mechanism that enables information to propagate from one step to the next. This process can be succinctly expressed using the following formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=g\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right) \\\\\n& \\tilde{x}_{t}=f\\left(x_{t}, h_{t}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn this equation, the functions $g$ and $f$ refer to the reset gate and update gate, respectively. The reset gate function, $g$, determines the extent to which the previous state, $h_{t-1}$, is reset or forgotten based on the current input, $x_{t}$. Subsequently, the update gate function, $f$, governs the proportion of the current input $x_{t}$ and the hidden current state $h_{t}$ that contribute to the computation of the output, $\\tilde{x}_{t}$. By utilizing these reset and update gates, RNNs effectively capture the temporal dependencies inherent in sequential data. ### 2.2.2 Receptance Weighted Key Value Model\n\nReceptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) Peng et al. [2023] model captures and propagates information in a sequential or auto-regressive mode Graves [2014] as integrating the capabilities of RNNs and attention mechanisms. This model consists of two core blocks, namely the time-mix block and the channel-mix block. Time-Mix Block This block aims to enhance the modeling of dependencies and patterns within a sequence by replacing the conventional weighted sum calculation in attention mechanisms with hidden states. By incorporating hidden states, the time-mix block can effectively propagate and update information across sequential steps. The calculations involved in this block can be expressed as follows:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nq_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{q} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{q}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{q} \\\\\nk_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{k} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{k}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{k} \\\\\nv_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{v} \\odot x_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{v}\\right) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{v} \\\\\no_{t} & =\\left(\\sigma\\left(q_{t}\\right) \\odot h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)\\right) \\cdot W_{o}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn these formulas, the representations of $q_{t}, k_{t}$, and $v_{t}$ are calculated by linearly interpolating between the current input and the input at the previous time for coherent and fluent token representations. The parameter $\\mu$ denotes the token shift, which determines the interpolation weight. Similar to tensor-product attention, this block applies a non-linear activation function $\\sigma$ to $q_{t}$ and combines it with the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ using element-wise multiplication as an update gate. Furthermore, the hidden states $h\\left(k_{t}, v_{t}\\right)$ serve as both the reset gate and a replacement for the traditional weighted sum value. This process of calculating the hidden states can be described by the following equations:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0}, p_{0} & =0,0,0 \\\\\np_{t} & =\\max \\left(p_{t-1}, k_{t}\\right) \\\\\nh_{t} & =\\frac{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot a_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot v_{t}}{\\exp \\left(p_{t-1}-p_{t}\\right) \\odot b_{t-1}+\\exp \\left(k_{t}-p_{t}\\right)}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that the position biases are omitted in these equations for convenience, and the division is element-wise division. Intuitively, the hidden states are computed recursively, and the vector $p$ serves as the reset gate in this process. Channel-Mix Block This block is to amplify the outputs of time-mix block, which is given by:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nr_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{r} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{r}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{r} \\\\\nz_{t} & =\\left(\\mu_{z} \\odot o_{t}+\\left(1-\\mu_{z}\\right) \\odot o_{t-1}\\right) \\cdot W_{z} \\\\\n\\tilde{x}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(r_{t}\\right) \\odot\\left(\\max \\left(z_{t}, 0\\right)^{2} \\cdot W_{v}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere squared ReLU activation So et al. [2022] is adopted. In these equations, the output $o_{t}$ contains the history information up to time $t$, and the interpolation weight $\\mu$ is derived from both $o_{t}$ and $o_{t-1}$ same as in time-mix block. Intuitively, this amplification process enhances the representations of historical information. In sum, the RWKV model has achieved the parallelization in a time-parallel mode due to the tensor-product Lei et al. [2018] and contains the linear computational costs for discarding similarity matrix.\n```\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: RWKV architecture linear attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture linear attention*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** SEA is proposed: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask, which estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Span-Selective Linear Attention Transformers for Effective and Robust Schema-Guided Dialogue State Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture linear attention*\n\n*Bj\u00f6rn Bebensee, Haejun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** In schema-guided dialogue state tracking models estimate the current state of a conversation using natural language descriptions of the service schema for generalization to unseen services. Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture linear attention*\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Recently, several linear attention architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have attracted much attention as they can process long sequences efficiently. In this work, we focus on designing an efficient segment-anything model by exploring these different architectures. Specifically, we design a mixed backbone that contains convolution and RWKV operation, which achieves the best for both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we design an efficient decoder to utilize the multiscale tokens to obtain high-quality masks. We denote our method as RWKV-SAM, a simple, effective, fast baseline for SAM-like models. Moreover, we build a benchmark containing various high-quality segmentation datasets and jointly train one efficient yet high-quality segmentation model using this benchmark. Based on the benchmark results, our RWKV-SAM achieves outstanding performance in efficiency and segmentation quality compared to transformers and other linear attention models. For example, compared with the same-scale transformer model, RWKV-SAM achieves more than 2x speedup and can achieve better segmentation performance on various datasets. In addition, RWKV-SAM outperforms recent vision Mamba models with better classification and semantic segmentation results.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV architecture linear attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, James Zou, Dylan Zinsley, Silas Alberti, Aman Timalsina, Michael Zhang, Sabri Eyuboglu, Simran Arora*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

This integration allows for efficient training and inference, leveraging the strengths of both architectures.\n  - The RWKV model is designed to handle long sequences efficiently, which is crucial for autoregressive language models. It achieves this by using linear attention, reducing the computational complexity from quadratic to linear.\n\n## Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n\n- **GLA Mechanism**: GLA introduces data-dependent gates that enhance the expressiveness of the model while maintaining linear complexity. This mechanism is particularly effective in length generalization and improving throughput compared to traditional attention mechanisms.\n  - GLA can be integrated into the RWKV architecture to further enhance its ability to handle long sequences efficiently and improve model adaptability.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **Reducing Computational Complexity**: The use of linear attention in both RWKV and GLA reduces the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, which significantly improves computational efficiency and scalability. This is crucial for large-scale autoregressive models.\n  - The integration of these mechanisms can also reduce memory costs, such as those associated with the KV-cache in Transformer models, as seen in the context of pruning attention layers.\n\n## Test-Time Training (TTT) and Adaptability\n\n- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Maintaining TTT capabilities while integrating GLA and RWKV is important. The dynamic adjustment of attention patterns during test-time can significantly enhance the model's adaptability to new data and contexts.\n  - This adaptability is particularly valuable in autoregressive models, where the ability to adjust attention patterns on the fly can improve performance on unseen data.\n\n## Implementation and Challenges\n\n- **Implementation Details**: Further investigation into the specific implementation details of GLA and RWKV in existing models can help understand potential challenges and solutions. For example, the paper by Yang et al. provides insights into the hardware-efficient training of GLA Transformers, which could be adapted for RWKV.\n  - The work by Peng et al. on RWKV and the Mega paper on Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention offer additional insights into efficient attention mechanisms and their implementation challenges.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Redundancy in Attention Layers**: Research on the redundancy in attention layers within Transformer architectures suggests that a significant portion of these layers can be pruned without degrading performance. This insight could be applied to RWKV and GLA models to further optimize their efficiency.\n  - The concept of \"Joint Layer Drop\" and \"Attention Drop\" methods can be explored to remove redundant layers, reducing both memory and computational costs while maintaining performance.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and adaptable autoregressive language models that integrate the benefits of RWKV architecture and linear attention mechanisms.\n",

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Downstream Tasks on LLaMA-2-7B. We analysis six downstream tasks: BBH, PIQA, MMLU, COPA, ARCC, and AGNews. Using standard evaluation settings, MMLU was tested with 5 shots, BBH with 3 shots, and the remaining tasks with zero shots. As shown in Tab. 7, our augmented linear attention not only reduces perplexity but also improves accuracy across all tasks. Specifically, with models like FLASH, our method achieved an average accuracy improvement of $3.53 \\%$. In addition, we extend our methods to three more linear attention methods, with summarized results in Appendix H. Generation Speedups by Integrating LAs with Speculative Decoding. We benchmark the speedups of our compatible LAs with speculative decoding. As shown in Tab. 8, we test the LLaMA-7B/13B models which are adapted into a chat model format, similar to LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c). Following Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), we train Medusa heads for speculative decoding. Speed tests for the 7B and 13B models are conducted on a single A100-80GB GPU, we observe that our revised LAs are compatible with speculative decoding and approximately doubled the speed. Table 9. Comparison of our method with the integration of FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) and Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b). | Methods | Total Latency | Attention | FFNs | Others |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| FLASH + Medusa | 137.2 ms | 119.7 ms | 8.2 ms | 9.3 ms |\n| Ours Aug.

To verify the effectiveness of our causal and compatible augmentation techniques, we compare them with the direct integration of previous linear attention FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) and the speculative decoding method Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b). As shown in Tab. 9, our method applied to LLaMA-2-7B models on A100 GPUs for a single batch of speculative decoding ( 64 speculated tokens and 42 sequence candidates), achieves a $64 \\%$ reduction in total latency compared to the direct integration, while also reducing QKV memory requirements by $75 \\%$ from 0.4 GB to 0.1 GB . Our techniques outperform direct integration because standard implementations, even with linear attention like FLASH and speculative decoding like Medusa, face two key limitations without our augmentations: (1) slow sequencebased decoding and (2) lack of optimizations such as shared cumulative sum (cumsum) and key-value (KV) states for batch processing. Conventional strategies for compatible KV caching rely on sequence-based decoding, assigning distinct KV caches to each speculated sequence candidate, as shown in Fig. 7. This results in unnecessary computational effort and memory inefficiency since candidates with identical prefixes are processed separately. In contrast, our method addresses these issues by ensuring identical prefixes are computed only once, mitigating these issues with timedependent causal and compatible augmentation in linear attention and speculative decoding. Our LA Speedups. We benchmarked the training speed of FLASH using both the original attention and our augmented LAs, with a batch size of 1 , on a single A100-40G GPU. Our results show that the augmented LAs significantly improve training speed. For sequence lengths of 4 K and 8 K , they are $1.52 \\times$ and $2.94 \\times$ faster, respectively. FLASH with augmented LAs takes 1.05 seconds and 1.95 seconds per training step for 4 K and 8 K sequences, compared to 1.60 seconds and 5.74 seconds with the original attention. The group size in FLASH was consistently set to 256. Extend to Longer Sequence. We fine-tuned LLaMA-27 B to extend its sequence length from 4 K to 8 K using our augmented LAs, following LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c) setting on the RedPajama dataset. For a fair comparison, we used only the local attention in LongLora, maintaining a block size of 256 . Our augmented LAs reduced perplexity from 15.29 to 13.86 , demonstrating their effectiveness in handling longer sequences. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nThis paper presents the first empirical analysis of linearized autoregressive LLMs, revealing significant limitations of existing linear attention methods in effectively handling masked attention and integration with speculative decoding. To address these challenges, we introduced an approach that combines effective local augmentation with seamless compatibility for speculative decoding. Our experiments across a range of LLMs consistently demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains. Notably, we achieve up to a 6.67 perplexity reduction and up to $2 \\times$ speedups in generation compared to existing linear attention methods. Our work paves the way for more efficient training and deployment of powerful autoregressive LLMs, especially for long-sequence applications. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPCN program (Award number: 1934767) and the CoCoSys, one of the seven centers in JUMP 2.0, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA.

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's GPT- 3 with its 175 billion parameters, have underscored the significant data and computational power required for such technologies. Training models of this scale incur substantial costs, both financially and environmentally. For instance, the cost necessary to train GPT-3 could exceed 4 million equivalent GPU hours (Brown et al., 2020), and the carbon footprint of training a single Transformer model might rival the lifetime emissions of five average American cars (Strubell et al., 2019). Addressing the challenges of efficient training and serving of LLMs is therefore not only a technical imperative but also an environmental and ethical necessity. Societal Consequences. The success of this project in enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs will have far-reaching implications, especially in processing long sequences commonly encountered in document handling. Our\nefforts are set to substantially influence various societal and economic sectors. The enhanced efficiency of LLMs promises transformative changes in diverse applications ranging from document summarization and question answering to personal digital assistants, security, and augmented reality. The development and exploration of linearized LLMs mark a pivotal progress in rendering these models both more accessible and environmentally sustainable. ## References\n\nAgrawal, A., Kedia, N., Panwar, A., Mohan, J., Kwatra, N., Gulavani, B.

Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Background\n\n### 2.1. Self Attention\n\nIf we have an input $\\mathbf{X}$ that belongs to $\\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $L$ represents sequence length and $d$ represents the embedding dimension, the attention mechanism produces pair-wise scores denoted as $\\mathbf{M}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\mathbf{M}=\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V})=\\sigma\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{Q} \\mathbf{K}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) \\mathbf{V} \\\\\n& \\text { where } \\mathbf{Q}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{K}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{V}=\\mathbf{X} \\mathbf{W}_{v}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathbf{W}_{q}, \\mathbf{W}_{k}, \\mathbf{W}_{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ are learnable weights, and $\\sigma$ is the attention function.

Linear attention Taking Norm as $\\sigma$ (Qin et al., 2024), to take advantage of the computational efficiency inherent in right matrix multiplication, the attention score $\\mathbf{M}$ can be transformed into its linear variant, which is mathematically equivalent due to the properties of matrix multiplication. $$\n\\mathbf{M}_{\\text {linear }}=\\operatorname{Norm}\\left(\\mathbf{Q}\\left(\\mathbf{K}^{\\top} \\mathbf{V}\\right)\\right)\n$$\n\n### 2.2. Linear Recurrent Models\n\nContinuous formulation. A model with a continuous time latent space transforms a one-dimensional input signal $u(t)$ into a latent state $x(t)$ that has $d_{s}$ dimensions, and then this $x(t)$ is transformed into a one-dimensional output signal $y(t)$. Clearly, we can define the process:\n\n$$\nx^{\\prime}(t)=\\mathbf{A} x(t)+\\mathbf{B} u(t), \\quad y(t)=\\mathbf{C} x(t)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s} \\times d_{s}}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$ and $\\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{s}}$. Eq. 3 is utilized in prior research to model long sequences. For instance, Gu et al. (2020a) suggests a set of matrices called HiPPO (high-order polynomial projection operators) to initialize A. The HiPPO matrices are constructed to enable the state $x(t)$ at time $t$ to remember the history of the input $u(t)$ up to the present.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/29 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n2022.

Several improvements have been proposed to bridge the performance gap: (i) incorporating the forgetting mechanism (Peng et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al., 2023; Peng et al., 2024), (ii) using local attention (Qin et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2023; Arora et al., 2024; Ren et al., 2024), (iii) using higher-order polynomial feature map (Arora et al., 2024, Kacham et al., 2023) to make the resulting attention distribution more sharp (Zhang et al. 2024), (iv) using more expressive yet efficient recurrent update rule (Schlag et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2024, Liu et al. 2024: Sun et al., 2024a).

Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2020)\t**Cited by** 1155  (*Influential: 164*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/28 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n(2019) and Kitaev et al. (2020). The former (Child et al., 2019) introduced sparse factorizations of the attention matrix reducing the overall complexity from quadratic to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ for generative modeling of long sequences. More recently, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed Reformer. This method further reduces complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)$ by using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to perform fewer dot products. Note that in order to be able to use LSH, Reformer constrains the keys, for the attention, to be identical to the queries. As a result this method cannot be used for decoding tasks where the keys need to be different from the queries. In comparison, linear transformers impose no constraints on the queries and keys and scale linearly with respect to the sequence length. Furthermore, they can be used to perform inference in autoregressive tasks three orders of magnitude faster, achieving comparable performance in terms of validation perplexity. ### 2.2. Understanding Self-Attention\n\nThere have been few efforts to better understand selfattention from a theoretical perspective. Tsai et al. (2019) proposed a kernel-based formulation of attention in transformers which considers attention as applying a kernel smoother over the inputs with the kernel scores being the similarity between inputs. This formulation provides a better way to understand attention components and integrate the positional embedding. In contrast, we use the kernel formulation to speed up the calculation of self-attention and lower its computational complexity. Also, we observe that if a kernel with positive similarity scores is applied on the queries and keys, linear attention converges normally. More recently, Cordonnier et al. (2020) provided theoretical proofs and empirical evidence that a multi-head selfattention with sufficient number of heads can express any convolutional layer. Here, we instead show that a selfattention layer trained with an autoregressive objective can be seen as a recurrent neural network and this observation can be used to significantly speed up inference time of autoregressive transformer models. ### 2.3. Linearized softmax\n\nFor many years, softmax has been the bottleneck for training classification models with a large number of categories (Goodman, 2001; Morin \\& Bengio, 2005; Mnih \\& Hinton, 2009). Recent works (Blanc \\& Rendle, 2017; Rawat et al., 2019), have approximated softmax with a linear dot product of feature maps to speed up the training through sampling. Inspired from these works, we linearize the softmax attention in transformers. Concurrently with this work, Shen et al. (2020) explored the use of linearized attention for the task of object detection in images. In comparison, we do not only linearize the attention computation, but also develop an autoregressive transformer model with linear complexity and constant memory for both inference and training. Moreover, we show that through the lens of kernels, every transformer can be seen as a recurrent neural network. ## 3. Linear Transformers\n\nIn this section, we formalize our proposed linear transformer. We present that changing the attention from the traditional softmax attention to a feature map based dot product attention results in better time and memory complexity as well as a causal model that can perform sequence generation in linear time, similar to a recurrent neural network. Initially, in $\\S 3.1$, we introduce a formulation for the transformer architecture introduced in (Vaswani et al., 2017). Subsequently, in $\\S 3.2$ and $\\S 3.3$ we present our proposed linear transformer and finally, in $\\S 3.4$ we rewrite the transformer as a recurrent neural network. ### 3.1. Transformers\n\nLet $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}$ denote a sequence of $N$ feature vectors of dimensions $F$. A transformer is a function $T: \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F} \\rightarrow$ $\\mathbb{R}^{N \\times F}$ defined by the composition of $L$ transformer layers $T_{1}(\\cdot), \\ldots, T_{L}(\\cdot)$ as follows,\n\n$$\nT_{l}(x)=f_{l}\\left(A_{l}(x)+x\\right)\n$$\n\nThe function $f_{l}(\\cdot)$ transforms each feature independently of the others and is usually implemented with a small two-layer feedforward network. $A_{l}(\\cdot)$ is the self attention function and is the only part of the transformer that acts across sequences. The self attention function $A_{l}(\\cdot)$ computes, for every position, a weighted average of the feature representations of all other positions with a weight proportional to a similarity score between the representations. Formally, the input sequence $x$ is projected by three matrices $W_{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times D}$, $W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times D}$ and $W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F \\times M}$ to corresponding representations $Q, K$ and $V$. The output for all positions, $A_{l}(x)=V^{\\prime}$, is computed as follows,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ & =x W_{Q} \\\\\nK & =x W_{K} \\\\\nV & =x W_{V} \\\\\nA_{l}(x)=V^{\\prime} & =\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{D}}\\right) V\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nNote that in the previous equation, the softmax function is applied rowwise to $Q K^{T}$. Following common terminology, the $Q, K$ and $V$ are referred to as the \"queries\", \"keys\" and \"values\" respectively. Equation 2 implements a specific form of self-attention called softmax attention where the similarity score is the exponential of the dot product between a query and a key. Given that subscripting a matrix with $i$ returns the $i$-th row as a vector, we can write a generalized attention equation for any similarity function as follows,\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\operatorname{sim}\\left(Q_{i}, K_{j}\\right) V_{j}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\operatorname{sim}\\left(Q_{i}, K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nEquation 3 is equivalent to equation 2 if we substitute the similarity function with $\\operatorname{sim}(q, k)=\\exp \\left(\\frac{q^{T} k}{\\sqrt{D}}\\right)$. ### 3.2. Linearized Attention\n\nThe definition of attention in equation 2 is generic and can be used to define several other attention implementations such as polynomial attention or RBF kernel attention (Tsai et al., 2019). Note that the only constraint we need to impose to $\\operatorname{sim}(\\cdot)$, in order for equation 3 to define an attention function, is to be non-negative. This includes all kernels $k(x, y): \\mathbb{R}^{2 \\times F} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}_{+}$. Given such a kernel with a feature representation $\\phi(x)$ we can rewrite equation 2 as follows,\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nand then further simplify it by making use of the associative property of matrix multiplication to\n\n$$\nV_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{\\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}^{T}}{\\phi\\left(Q_{i}\\right)^{T} \\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)}\n$$\n\nThe above equation is simpler to follow when the numerator is written in vectorized form as follows,\n\n$$\n\\left(\\phi(Q) \\phi(K)^{T}\\right) V=\\phi(Q)\\left(\\phi(K)^{T} V\\right)\n$$\n\nNote that the feature map $\\phi(\\cdot)$ is applied rowwise to the matrices $Q$ and $K$. From equation 2, it is evident that the computational cost of softmax attention scales with $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2}\\right)$, where $N$ represents the sequence length. The same is true for the memory requirements because the full attention matrix must be stored to compute the gradients with respect to the queries, keys and values. In contrast, our proposed linear transformer from equation 5 has time and memory complexity $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ because we can compute $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right) V_{j}^{T}$ and $\\sum_{j=1}^{N} \\phi\\left(K_{j}\\right)$ once and reuse them for every query. ### 3.2.1. Feature Maps and Computational Cost\n\nFor softmax attention, the total cost in terms of multiplications and additions scales as $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^{2} \\max (D, M)\\right)$, where $D$ is the dimensionality of the queries and keys and $M$ is the dimensionality of the values. On the contrary, for linear attention, we first compute the feature maps of dimensionality $C$. Subsequently, computing the new values requires $\\mathcal{O}(N C M)$ additions and multiplications. The previous analysis does not take into account the choice of kernel and feature function. Note that the feature function that corresponds to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional, which makes the linearization of exact softmax attention infeasible. On the other hand, the polynomial kernel, for example, has an exact finite dimensional feature map and has been shown to work equally well with the exponential or RBF kernel (Tsai et al., 2019). The computational cost for a linearized polynomial transformer of degree 2 is $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N D^{2} M\\right)$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: linear attention autoregressive models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. ImageBART: Bidirectional Context with Multinomial Diffusion for Autoregressive Image Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention autoregressive models*\n\n*Patrick Esser, Robin Rombach, A. Blattmann, B. Ommer*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting autoregressive ImageBART model can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training and can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive models and their sequential factorization of the data likelihood have recently demonstrated great potential for image representation and synthesis. Nevertheless, they incorporate image context in a linear 1D order by attending only to previously synthesized image patches above or to the left. Not only is this unidirectional, sequential bias of attention unnatural for images as it disregards large parts of a scene until synthesis is almost complete. It also processes the entire image on a single scale, thus ignoring more global contextual information up to the gist of the entire scene. As a remedy we incorporate a coarse-to-fine hierarchy of context by combining the autoregressive formulation with a multinomial diffusion process: Whereas a multistage diffusion process successively removes information to coarsen an image, we train a (short) Markov chain to invert this process. In each stage, the resulting autoregressive ImageBART model progressively incorporates context from previous stages in a coarse-to-fine manner. Experiments show greatly improved image modification capabilities over autoregressive models while also providing high-fidelity image generation, both of which are enabled through efficient training in a compressed latent space. Specifically, our approach can take unrestricted, user-provided masks into account to perform local image editing. Thus, in contrast to pure autoregressive models, it can solve free-form image inpainting and, in the case of conditional models, local, text-guided image modification without requiring mask-specific training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 136  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 2.

Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Two simple yet effective strategies for the iterative NAR model: dynamic sliding window attention (DSWA) and linear temperature decay (LTD) can alleviate long-distance collapse problems and achieve longer text generation with a flexible trade-off between performance and inference speedup.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained autoregressive (AR) language models such as BART and GPTs have dominated OPen-ended Long Text Generation (Open-LTG).However, the AR nature will decrease the inference efficiency along with the increase of generation length, which hinder their application in Open-LTG.To improve inference efficiency, we alternatively explore the potential of the pre-trained masked language models (MLMs) along with a representative iterative non-autoregressive (NAR) decoding strategy for Open-LTG.Our preliminary study shows that pre-trained MLMs can merely generate short text and will collapse for long text modeling.To enhance the long text generation capability of MLMs, we introduce two simple yet effective strategies for the iterative NAR model: dynamic sliding window attention (DSWA) and linear temperature decay (LTD). It can alleviate long-distance collapse problems and achieve longer text generation with a flexible trade-off between performance and inference speedup.Experiments on the storytelling and multi-paragraph opinionated article writing tasks show that pre-trained MLMs can achieve more than 3 \\times \\to 13 \\times speedup with better performance than strong AR models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention autoregressive models*\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, Mohammad Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

The Impact of Positional Encodings on Multilingual Compression\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention autoregressive models*\n\n*Vinit Ravishankar, Anders S\u00f8gaard*\n\n**TL;DR:** While sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models, because they were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps.\n\n**Abstract:** In order to preserve word-order information in a non-autoregressive setting, transformer architectures tend to include positional knowledge, by (for instance) adding positional encodings to token embeddings. Several modifications have been proposed over the sinusoidal positional encodings used in the original transformer architecture; these include, for instance, separating position encodings and token embeddings, or directly modifying attention weights based on the distance between word pairs. We first show that surprisingly, while these modifications tend to improve monolingual language models, none of them result in better multilingual language models. We then answer why that is: sinusoidal encodings were explicitly designed to facilitate compositionality by allowing linear projections over arbitrary time steps. Higher variances in multilingual training distributions requires higher compression, in which case, compositionality becomes indispensable. Learned absolute positional encodings (e.g., in mBERT) tend to approximate sinusoidal embeddings in multilingual settings, but more complex positional encoding architectures lack the inductive bias to effectively learn cross-lingual alignment. In other words, while sinusoidal positional encodings were designed for monolingual applications, they are particularly useful in multilingual language models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention autoregressive models*\n\n*Yingyan Celine Lin, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Zheng Wang, Yichao Fu, Haoran You*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n**Conference:** an-attention-free-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. DSANet: Dual Self-Attention Network for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention autoregressive models*\n\n*Siteng Huang  Donglin Wang\u2217*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate time series forecasting has attracted wide attention in areas, such as system, traffic, and finance. The difficulty of the task lies in that traditional methods fail to capture complicated nonlinear dependencies between time steps and between multiple time series. Recently, recurrent neural network and attention mechanism have been used to model periodic temporal patterns across multiple time steps. However, these models fit not well for time series with dynamic-period patterns or nonperiodic patterns. In this paper, we propose a dual self-attention network (DSANet) for highly efficient multivariate time series forecasting, especially for dynamic-period or nonperiodic series. DSANet completely dispenses with recurrence and utilizes two parallel convolutional components, called global temporal convolution and local temporal convolution, to capture complex mixtures of global and local temporal patterns.\r\nMoreover, DSANet employs a self-attention module to model dependencies between multiple series. To further improve the robustness, DSANet also integrates a traditional autoregressive linear model in parallel to the non-linear neural network. Experiments on realworld multivariate time series data show that the proposed model is effective and outperforms baselines.\n\n**Proceeding:** cikm-19-november-37-2019-beijing-china-2019\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using linear attention mechanisms, here are some key insights and references that can guide the researchers:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\nLinear attention mechanisms have been shown to offer significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and scalability.\n\n- **Reduced Computational Complexity**: Linear attention models, such as those using ReLU linear attention, reduce the computational complexity from quadratic to linear, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently. This is highlighted in the context of image generation but is equally relevant for language models.\n- **Efficient Training and Inference**: The use of linear attention in models like RWKV combines the efficiency of RNNs with the capabilities of Transformers, leading to faster training and inference times. This is achieved by leveraging linear attention to process sequences efficiently.\n\n## Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\nGLA is particularly promising for enhancing the expressiveness and efficiency of autoregressive models.\n\n- **Data-Dependent Gates**: GLA introduces data-dependent gates that enhance the model's expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity.

Dynamic adjustment of attention patterns during test-time can significantly enhance the model's adaptability and performance in various tasks.\n\n## Empirical and Theoretical Insights\nSeveral papers and discussions provide empirical and theoretical insights that can guide the improvement of autoregressive language models.\n\n- **Convergence and Optimization**: Studies have shown that adding more attention heads in linear attention models can achieve faster convergence of training loss compared to adding more layers. This suggests that the number of heads is crucial for optimization.\n- **In-Context Learning**: Linear attention mechanisms have been shown to be effective in in-context learning, which is a critical aspect of modern language models. Papers like \"Linear Transformers with Learnable Kernel Functions are Better In-Context Models\" provide insights into how these mechanisms can be optimized for in-context learning.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n- **Ablation Studies and Model Design**: Conducting ablation studies to understand the impact of different components, such as the replacement of traditional softmax attention with linear attention, can provide valuable insights. For example, using Mix-FFN blocks to enhance local information capture can compensate for the weaker local information-capturing ability of linear attention.\n- **Optimization and Generalization**: Investigating the optimization and generalization of multi-head attention in the context of linear attention models can help in fine-tuning the model for better performance on downstream tasks.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage the benefits of linear attention mechanisms and the RWKV architecture.\n",

The TTTLinear GAU addresses some of these challenges by enabling test-time training with expressive hidden states. However, it still relies on conventional attention mechanisms, which are computationally intensive for long sequences.\n\nThe motivation behind **FastTTTLinear** is to enhance the TTTLinear GAU by integrating linear attention mechanisms that offer linear time and space complexity. By incorporating **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)** and inspirations from the **RWKV architecture**, we aim to improve computational efficiency and scalability without compromising the model's expressiveness or its ability to adapt during test-time training.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n\n- **Data-Dependent Gates**: GLA introduces gates that modulate attention weights based on input data, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity.\n- **Length Generalization**: GLA models generalize effectively to sequences longer than those encountered during training.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Training**: Implements FLASHLinearAttention algorithm for faster computation, optimizing memory movement against parallelizability.\n\n*Reference*: Yang, S., Wang, B., Shen, Y., Panda, R., & Kim, Y.
