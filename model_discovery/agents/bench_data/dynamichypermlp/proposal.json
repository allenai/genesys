Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3. A comprehensive comparison of the cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ of HyperMixer and Transformers. (Sections: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6)\n4. An ablation demonstrating that HyperMixer learns attention patterns similar to Transformers. (Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.78)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/30 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.06031, 2016.

Biological credit assignment through dynamic inversion of feedforward networks\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Feedforward Networks*\n\n*William F. Podlaski, C. Machens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that feedforward network transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics, and derives this dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the forward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random feedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning depends on changes in synaptic connections deep inside the brain. In multilayer networks, these changes are triggered by error signals fed back from the output, generally through a stepwise inversion of the feedforward processing steps. The gold standard for this process -- backpropagation -- works well in artificial neural networks, but is biologically implausible. Several recent proposals have emerged to address this problem, but many of these biologically-plausible schemes are based on learning an independent set of feedback connections. This complicates the assignment of errors to each synapse by making it dependent upon a second learning problem, and by fitting inversions rather than guaranteeing them. Here, we show that feedforward network transformations can be effectively inverted through dynamics. We derive this dynamic inversion from the perspective of feedback control, where the forward transformation is reused and dynamically interacts with fixed or random feedback to propagate error signals during the backward pass. Importantly, this scheme does not rely upon a second learning problem for feedback because accurate inversion is guaranteed through the network dynamics. We map these dynamics onto generic feedforward networks, and show that the resulting algorithm performs well on several supervised and unsupervised datasets. We also link this dynamic inversion to Gauss-Newton optimization, suggesting a biologically-plausible approximation to second-order learning. Overall, our work introduces an alternative perspective on credit assignment in the brain, and proposes a special role for temporal dynamics and feedback control during learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

A common approach to combatting such biological heterogeneity involves averaging over large redundant networks of $N$ neurons resulting in coding errors that decrease classically as $1/\\sqrt{N}$. Recent work demonstrated a novel mechanism whereby recurrent spiking networks could efficiently encode dynamic stimuli, achieving a superclassical scaling in which coding errors decrease as $1/N$. This specific mechanism involved two key ideas: predictive coding, and a tight balance, or cancellation between strong feedforward inputs and strong recurrent feedback. However, the theoretical principles governing the efficacy of balanced predictive coding and its robustness to noise, synaptic weight heterogeneity and communication delays remain poorly understood. To discover such principles, we introduce an analytically tractable model of balanced predictive coding, in which the degree of balance and the degree of weight disorder can be dissociated unlike in previous balanced network models, and we develop a mean field theory of coding accuracy. Overall, our work provides and solves a general theoretical framework for dissecting the differential contributions neural noise, synaptic disorder, chaos, synaptic delays, and balance to the fidelity of predictive neural codes, reveals the fundamental role that balance plays in achieving superclassical scaling, and unifies previously disparate models in theoretical neuroscience.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

In this work, we make an attempt along this line by reformulating the training procedure from the trajectory optimization perspective. We first show that most widely-used algorithms for training DNNs can be linked to the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP), a celebrated second-order trajectory optimization algorithm rooted in the Approximate Dynamic Programming. In this vein, we propose a new variant of DDP that can accept batch optimization for training feedforward networks, while integrating naturally with the recent progress in curvature approximation. The resulting algorithm features layer-wise feedback policies which improve convergence rate and reduce sensitivity to hyper-parameter over existing methods. We show that the algorithm is competitive against state-ofthe-art first and second order methods.

Here, we explore the use of HyperNetworks to generate hyper-prompts: we propose HyperPrompt, a novel architecture for prompt-based task-conditioning of self-attention in Transformers. The hyper-prompts are end-to-end learnable via generation by a HyperNetwork. HyperPrompt allows the network to learn task-specific feature maps where the hyper-prompts serve as task global memories for the queries to attend to, at the same time enabling flexible information sharing among tasks.

Distilling Morphology-Conditioned Hypernetworks for Efficient Universal Morphology Control\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks in Transformers*\n\n*Zheng Xiong, Risto Vuorio, Jacob Beck, Matthieu Zimmer, Kun Shao, Shimon Whiteson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis attributes the efficiency advantage of HyperDistill at inference time to knowledge decoupling, i.e., the ability to decouple inter-task and intra-task knowledge, a general principle that could also be applied to improve inference efficiency in other domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning a universal policy across different robot morphologies can significantly improve learning efficiency and enable zero-shot generalization to unseen morphologies. However, learning a highly performant universal policy requires sophisticated architectures like transformers (TF) that have larger memory and computational cost than simpler multi-layer perceptrons (MLP). To achieve both good performance like TF and high efficiency like MLP at inference time, we propose HyperDistill, which consists of: (1) A morphology-conditioned hypernetwork (HN) that generates robot-wise MLP policies, and (2) A policy distillation approach that is essential for successful training. We show that on UNIMAL, a benchmark with hundreds of diverse morphologies, HyperDistill performs as well as a universal TF teacher policy on both training and unseen test robots, but reduces model size by 6-14 times, and computational cost by 67-160 times in different environments. Our analysis attributes the efficiency advantage of HyperDistill at inference time to knowledge decoupling, i.e., the ability to decouple inter-task and intra-task knowledge, a general principle that could also be applied to improve inference efficiency in other domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Stochastic Adaptive Activation Function\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Activation Functions*\n\n*Kyungsu Lee, Jaeseung Yang, Haeyun Lee, J. Y. Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed activation function mathematically exhibits a more generalized form of Swish activation function, and thus it is denoted as Adaptive SwisH (ASH), which can provide the benefits of more accurate prediction and earlier convergence in many deep learning applications.\n\n**Abstract:** The simulation of human neurons and neurotransmission mechanisms has been realized in deep neural networks based on the theoretical implementations of activation functions. However, recent studies have reported that the threshold potential of neurons exhibits different values according to the locations and types of individual neurons, and that the activation functions have limitations in terms of representing this variability. Therefore, this study proposes a simple yet effective activation function that facilitates different thresholds and adaptive activations according to the positions of units and the contexts of inputs. Furthermore, the proposed activation function mathematically exhibits a more generalized form of Swish activation function, and thus we denoted it as Adaptive SwisH (ASH). ASH highlights informative features that exhibit large values in the top percentiles in an input, whereas it rectifies low values. Most importantly, ASH exhibits trainable, adaptive, and context-aware properties compared to other activation functions. Furthermore, ASH represents general formula of the previously studied activation function and provides a reasonable mathematical background for the superior performance. To validate the effectiveness and robustness of ASH, we implemented ASH into many deep learning models for various tasks, including classification, detection, segmentation, and image generation. Experimental analysis demonstrates that our activation function can provide the benefits of more accurate prediction and earlier convergence in many deep learning applications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

With this adaptive activation function, we are able to improve upon deep neural network architectures composed of static rectified linear units, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CIFAR-10 (7.51%), CIFAR-100 (30.83%), and a benchmark from high-energy physics involving Higgs boson decay modes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 466  (*Influential: 44*)\n\n#### 8. Polyhedron Attention Module: Learning Adaptive-order Interactions\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Activation Functions*\n\n*Tan Zhu, Fei Dou, Xinyu Wang, Jin Lu, Jinbo Bi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) is proposed to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning feature interactions can be the key for multivariate predictive modeling. ReLU-activated neural networks create piecewise linear prediction models. Other nonlinear activation functions lead to models with only high-order feature interactions, thus lacking of interpretability. Recent methods incorporate candidate polynomial terms of fixed orders into deep learning, which is subject to the issue of combinatorial explosion, or learn the orders that are difficult to adapt to different regions of the feature space. We propose a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece. PAM is interpretable to identify important interactions in predicting a target. Theoretic analysis shows that PAM has stronger expression capability than ReLU-activated networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior classification performance of PAM on massive datasets of the click-through rate prediction and PAM can learn meaningful interaction effects in a medical problem.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Comparing Dynamics: Deep Neural Networks versus Glassy Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Feedforward Networks*\n\n*M. Geiger, M. Baity-Jesi, Y. LeCun, S. Spigler, C. Cammarota, M. Wyart, G. Ben Arous, L. Sagun, G. Biroli*\n\n**Abstract:** We analyze numerically the training dynamics of deep neural networks (DNN) by\nusing methods developed in statistical physics of glassy systems. The two main\nissues we address are (1) the complexity of the loss landscape and of the\ndynamics within it, and (2) to what extent DNNs share similarities with glassy\nsystems. Our findings, obtained for different architectures and datasets,\nsuggest that during the training process the dynamics slows down because of an\nincreasingly large number of flat directions. At large times, when the loss is\napproaching zero, the system diffuses at the bottom of the landscape. Despite\nsome similarities with the dynamics of mean-field glassy systems, in\nparticular, the absence of barrier crossing, we find distinctive dynamical\nbehaviors in the two cases, showing that the statistical properties of the\ncorresponding loss and energy landscapes are different. In contrast, when the\nnetwork is under-parametrized we observe a typical glassy behavior, thus\nsuggesting the existence of different phases depending on whether the network\nis under-parametrized or over-parametrized.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2018\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. DANA: Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture for Multivariate Sensor Data\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Feedforward Networks*\n\n*Hamed Haddadi, Andrea Cavallaro, Richard G. Clegg, Mohammad Malekzadeh*\n\n**Abstract:** Motion sensors embedded in wearable and mobile devices allow for dynamic selection of sensor streams and sampling rates, enabling several applications, such as power management and data-sharing control. While deep neural networks (DNNs) achieve competitive accuracy in sensor data classification, DNNs generally process incoming data from a fixed set of sensors with a fixed sampling rate, and changes in the dimensions of their inputs cause considerable accuracy loss, unnecessary computations, or failure in operation. We introduce a dimension-adaptive pooling (DAP) layer that makes DNNs flexible and more robust to changes in sensor availability and in sampling rate. DAP operates on convolutional filter maps of variable dimensions and produces an input of fixed dimensions suitable for feedforward and recurrent layers. We also propose a dimension-adaptive training (DAT) procedure for enabling DNNs that use DAP to better generalize over the set of feasible data dimensions at inference time. DAT comprises the random selection of dimensions during the forward passes and optimization with accumulated gradients of several backward passes. Combining DAP and DAT, we show how to transform non-adaptive DNNs into a Dimension-Adaptive Neural Architecture (DANA), while keeping the same number of parameters. Compared to existing approaches, our solution provides better classification accuracy over the range of possible data dimensions at inference time and does not require up-sampling or imputation, thus reducing unnecessary computations. Experiments on seven datasets (four benchmark real-world datasets for human activity recognition and three synthetic datasets) show that DANA prevents significant losses in classification accuracy of the state-of-the-art DNNs and, compared to baselines, it better captures correlated patterns in sensor data under dynamic sensor availability and varying sampling rates.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks in Transformers*\n\n*James Henderson, Mostafa Dehghani, Sebastian Ruder, Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks in Transformers*\n\n*Jie Fu, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Boris Knyazev, Xinyu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks. We provide the codes in https://github.com/Blackzxy/LoGAH .\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-25\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Deep Kronecker neural networks: A general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation functions\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Activation Functions*\n\n*George Em Karniadakis, Kenji Kawaguchi, Yeonjong Shin, Ameya D. Jagtap*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new type of neural networks, Kronecker neural networks (KNNs), that form a general framework for neural networks with adaptive activation functions. KNNs employ the Kronecker product, which provides an efficient way of constructing a very wide network while keeping the number of parameters low. Our theoretical analysis reveals that under suitable conditions, KNNs induce a faster decay of the loss than that by the feed-forward networks. This is also empirically verified through a set of computational examples. Furthermore, under certain technical assumptions, we establish global convergence of gradient descent for KNNs. As a specific case, we propose the Rowdy activation function that is designed to get rid of any saturation region by injecting sinusoidal fluctuations, which include trainable parameters. The proposed Rowdy activation function can be employed in any neural network architecture like feed-forward neural networks, Recurrent neural networks, Convolutional neural networks etc. The effectiveness of KNNs with Rowdy activation is demonstrated through various computational experiments including function approximation using feed-forward neural networks, solution inference of partial differential equations using the physics-informed neural networks, and standard deep learning benchmark problems using convolutional and fully-connected neural networks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate HyperNetworks or dynamic parameter generation into the MLP blocks of Transformers, such as the `SwiGluMLP` GAU, here are some key points and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n### HyperNetworks\n- The concept of HyperNetworks, where a smaller network generates the weights for a larger network, is highly relevant.

Summary of Analysis\n\nAfter reviewing the new search results, it is evident that integrating **HyperNetworks** into the `SwiGluMLP` GAU is a promising direction for enhancing the model's expressiveness and adaptability. The concept has been successfully applied in models like **HyperMixer**, which dynamically generates MLP weights using hypernetworks within an MLP-based architecture, achieving performance on par with Transformers at a lower computational cost. Additionally, research on parameter-efficient multi-task learning using shared hypernetworks and prompt-based task conditioning supports the feasibility of this approach. These insights suggest that modifying the `SwiGluMLP` to include dynamic weight generation via hypernetworks could improve performance on language modeling tasks while maintaining efficiency.\n\n## 2.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

The target value is the average height in each pair of shapes. An example input is shown in Figure 5a. To solve the task well, for each position, the model must attend to other positions with the same shape. Models We compare the token mixing layer of HyperMixer to three other models: i) None does not model token interactions. All predictions are thus only made based on local information. This model should thus fail. ii) MLPMixer does model token interactions. Still, since its token mixing weights are position-specific, each position has to learn to recognize each shape, which we expect to be difficult, especially with little data. iii) Selfattention can be considered the upper bound, as it models the interaction between every two positions explicitly. Results Figure 5b shows the mean squared error on the test examples depending on the number of training examples. As expected, None fails on this task. While all other models are able to solve the task with enough training data, MLPMixer is considerably less data-efficient than the other two models, requiring 5-10 times more data to reach the same performance. This is expected, since in contrast to HyperMixer and self-attention, MLPMixer's token mixing module is not positioninvariant. HyperMixer and self-attention reach approximately the same performance when training on 100k examples. However, HyperMixer is more\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-08.jpg?height=1491&width=1577&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=240)\n\nFigure 5: Results and pseudo-attention maps on the synthetic task (Fleuret, 2019). data-efficient than self-attention, which we attribute to the simpler model architecture. We can measure the interactions between two tokens by computing the gradient of an output token with respect to an input token (pseudo-attention). Figures 5d and 5c show the pseudo-attention maps of HyperMixer in comparison to attention. We observe that the pseudo-attention weights of HyperMixer and attention are similar. This indicates that HyperMixer indeed learns an attention-like function. In contrast, we find these patterns to be weaker in MLPMixer (Figure 6, appendix). ## 5 Discussion\n\nIn the following, we first discuss the merits of our proposed model, which are the core contributions of our paper. We then discuss the scope of our analysis. ### 5.1 Impact\n\nBest all-MLP model HyperMixer was designed as an MLP-based architecture with similar inductive biases as Transformers, which are beneficial for natural language understanding. Our hypothesis (H1) is that this leads to improvements over other MLP-based methods. Our experimental results support this hypothesis, as we find HyperMixer to outperform all MLP-based baselines on all datasets (Section 4.3). Low cost model The main motivation for an MLP-based architecture is the efficiency benefits induced by its simplicity. Therefore, we hypothesized (H2) that HyperMixer would reduce the cost\n$\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ to obtain an AI result $R$. This hypothesis is supported by our experiments. While HyperMixer yields results that are on par with Transformer's results, it reduces the cost of all three cost factors: i) The cost of processing a single example (E) is lower, particularly for long inputs due to its linear complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of self-attention (Section 4.4). ii) The number of required training examples (D) is reduced, as HyperMixer's relative performance improvement is larger in the low-resource scenario (Section 4.5). iii) HyperMixer requires less hyperparameter tuning than Transformers to reach good results, which is demonstrated by HyperMixer's higher expected relative improvements at low tuning budgets (Section 4.6). Attention-like model Finally, our experiments on a synthetic task indicate that HyperMixer can learn very similar attention patterns as the selfattention mechanism in Transformers (Section 4.7), supporting hypothesis H3. While MLPMixer can also learn similar patterns given enough training data, we believe that it is the introduction of adequate biases that allows HyperMixer to learn these patterns efficiently. These biases were chosen based on an analysis of Transformer's success by Henderson (2020). HyperMixer's own success hence supports that analysis. In summary, in our study, HyperMixer is the bestperforming MLP-based architecture, and shows comparable performance and behavior as selfattention at substantially lower cost. HyperMixer can thus be considered a low cost alternative to Transformers. ### 5.2 Scope\n\nSmall resource scenario It is important to note that our study is limited to the small resource scenario: Our models are small, not pretrained on large general-purpose corpora, and trained on datasets with fewer than 1 million examples. It is unclear if our results will also hold on larger scale. For example, while gMLP and FNet perform poorly in the low-resource scenario as demonstrated in our experiments, both models are able to narrow the gap to Transformer-based models as the resources for pretraining increase (Liu et al., 2021; Lee-Thorp et al., 2021). We hypothesize that with enough resources, these models are able to overcome their shortcomings in terms of inductive biases. However, there is no reason to believe that\nHyperMixer, being equipped with useful inductive biases, wouldn't perform on par with Transformers in high-resource scenarios while retaining its lower overall cost. Quite the contrary, HyperMixer's linear complexity in sequence length perhaps makes it more appropriate for large-scale pretraining on long contexts than vanilla Transformers. Versatility One of the most impressive qualities of Transformers is their versatility: Not only are they now the standard architecture for all NLP tasks, but over the years they have also become ubiquitous in a wide range of applications domains outside of NLP. Of course, the present study cannot determine whether HyperMixer is as versatile as Transformers. However, subsequent studies have shown that HyperMixer has uses in speech recognition (Mai et al., 2023) and neural combinatorial optimization (Drakulic et al., 2023). Still, some modeling advancements are needed. For example, HyperMixing is not yet applicable for decoder models that make use of causal masking. As decoderonly language models have become widely studied, this constitutes promising future work. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWhile large pretrained Transformer language models have led to impressive progress, they require so much resources that many research labs are excluded from participation, leading to calls for Green AI. We have proposed an MLP-based method, HyperMixer, that, in contrast to previous MLP-based methods, is equipped with the same inductive biases that made Transformers so successful for natural language understanding. While it performs on par with Transformers, it incurs substantially lower cost in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning. Hence, we believe our study demonstrates the merits of MLP-based models for natural language understanding as an alternative to attention-based models, and we hope that the community pursues this direction further. Avenues for future work include large-scale pretraining, evaluation on a wider range of tasks and domains, and the model's adaptation to text generation. ## Limitations\n\nMany limitations of our study are already discussed in Section 5.2, however, we repeat and add to them explicitly here. Small resource scenario Our study investigates MLP-based architectures for text classification tasks and finds competitive performance with vanilla Transformers while having lower cost in terms of the Green AI equation. However, the scope of our findings is naturally limited to the testing scenario, which is low-resource: Our models are relatively small, not pretrained on large generalpurpose corpora, and trained on datasets with fewer than 1 million examples. We may not say with certainty that our results will also hold on larger scale. For the sake of hypothesis-driven research we consider it more valuable to run many controlled small-scale experiments rather than few large-scale experiments. Nonetheless, scaling up should certainly be part of future research directions, as this is essential for optimal task performance. Limitation to English pairwise sentence classification tasks Since token mixing is the independent variable in our study, we put our main focus on English sentence-pair classification tasks with textual input only, which we presume (and provide some evidence for) to be most useful to assess differences between token mixing models. Of course, vanilla Transformers are very flexible in the sense that, over the course of many studies, they have been shown to be very effective for a wide range of tasks, languages and data modalities. Whether or not the proposed HyperMixer model possesses similar flexibility cannot be answered in this study. The HyperMixer encoder arguably possesses similar inductive biases as Transformers. We thus expect it to be straight-forward to apply to tasks that are also solved well by Transformer encoders (e.g., span classification). For tasks such as language modeling, which involve a Transformer decoder, significant modeling advancements are required to obtain a HyperMixer equivalent. We consider this a very promising direction for future work. Limitation to MLP-based baselines Similar to a trend in the computer vision community, our study investigates the suitability of MLP-based architectures for NLP. Due to their conceptual simplicity, these models promise to be easier to train, potentially leading to reduced Green AI costs. To this end we compare our proposed HyperMixer model to a range of other MLP-based models, and Transformers. Apart from FNet and Linear Transformers, which are efficient Transformer alternatives, we do not attempt an exhaustive comparison to non-MLP-based efficient NLP models. Hence, the scope of our claims does not extend to all efficient Transformer models. However, these models are of course very relevant to this study, as they are targeted towards one of the factors of Green AI cost (single forward pass complexity). Therefore, we regard a comprehensive comparison as valuable future work. ## Acknowledgements\n\nFlorian Mai was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under the project LAOS, grant number 200021_178862.

All models have 6 layers with token embedding size $d=256$ and hidden size $d^{\\prime}=512$. For MLPMixer and gMLP we set the size of the token mixing modules to $N=250$ and $N=100$, respectively. These lengths are chosen to match the number of parameters of the other models $(11 \\mathrm{M})$. The hidden layer size is set to 512 in all models. We use dropout at the input to each layer with a probability of 0.1 . For all models, including the ablations, we first tune the learning rate of Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) using a logarithmically spaced grid of 7 values $\\alpha \\in$ $\\{0.001,0.0005,0.0002,0.0001,0.00005,0.00002$, $0.00001\\}$ on the validation set. For our baselines, we then evaluate 10 different seeds and report the mean accuracy and standard deviation on the validation set. On the test set, we only report the results of the model yielding the best results on the validation set, as the GLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2018) has a hidden test set with limited access. Ablations are evaluated on the validation set with a single seed. ## B. 3 Time per Example\n\nDue to the lack of reliable software to measure FOPs in PyTorch, we calculate these numbers manually. Our process is described in Appendix D.

We have a dataset made of 1 D sequences that contain two rectangular and two triangular shapes. Each of these shapes has a different height taken at random in the input sequence. The output sequence has the same shapes in the same positions, but the heights of triangular shapes should be the mean of the two triangular shapes in the input sequence. Similarly, the height of the rectangular shapes in the output sequence is the mean of the height of the two rectangular shapes in the input sequence. So the model should be able to see across the sequence and compute the mean of the two different shapes to succeed at the task. All the models considered for this task have a similar structure: they consist of a particular layer (MLPMixer, HyperMixer, or Attention) surrounded by two pairs of 1D-convolutional layers with kernels of size five and a symmetric zero-padding of size two so that the output shape is constant. We made an ablation to ensure that this layer was mandatory by changing it with another similar 1D convolutional layer, which corresponds to None in the figure 5b. Before visualizing the pseudo-attention maps, all models were trained on 25,000 training examples. We use input-gradients (Simonyan et al., 2014) to evaluate whether models could \u00ab attend \u00bb to the different shapes. This method computes the gradient of the output sequence with respect to the input sequence, giving the corresponding saliency map, which can then be recombined into a pseudo-attention matrix where the $i$-th column corresponds to the saliency maps of the $i$-th out- put token. A large value in the $(i, j)$ entries of the pseudo-attention matrix means that the output token $i$ strongly depends on the input $j$, and we can thus compare it to an attention matrix 6 a . Figure 6 represents the pseudo-attention matrices for the different models. We can notice that it indeed approximates the true attention matrix 6 a and that the model with no special layer cannot attend to the correct part of the sequence, as expected. Finally, we can see that the pseudo-attention of the Mixer layer is not as peaked as the one corresponding to the Attention or HyperMixer layer. ## C Further Results\n\n## C. 1 Validation Set Results\n\nIn Table 3, we show the best scores on the validation set that we obtained from the grid search (using a fixed seed), alongside the learning rate that yielded that score. In Section 4.3, we reported the test set results of all models when using the best-performing seed. In Table 4, we show test set results when using the median seed. ## C. 2 Ablations\n\nWe first describe the ablation models before we discuss their results. Feature Mixing Only The most simplistic MLP architecture is one that doesn't use token mixing, i.e., the token mixing module is set to the identity function. The outputs at the last layer are aggregated via average pooling before plugged into the linear classifier. This allows a baseline where the token interactions are not modeled. Therefore, this architecture serves as a control for how important token mixing is in any given task. Token Mixing Only A simplistic single layer MLP architecture ablation. This model consists of a variable dimension MLP where the weights are generated using a hypernetwork which only allows for location interaction. This model is included to argue that the best simple model requires both location and feature mixing to efficiently model textual inputs. Shared Weight-Vector A simple way to obtain a variable size location-mixing MLP is by weightsharing. Concretely, we use a single learnable weight vector $w_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime}}$, which we copy $N$ times to create a weight matrix $W_{1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d^{\\prime}}$.

(2020) challenges the current pursuit for higher accuracy at the cost of larger computation with the notion of \"Green $\\mathrm{AI}^{2}$. Moreover, Strubell et al. (2019) estimated the monetary and environmental cost of large model pretraining. Apart from being problematic environmentally, they argue that the monetary cost of pretraining is too high to be widely accessible for most researchers. In a research community that focuses on task performance, low resourced researchers would be disadvantaged. Therefore, metrics that take the cost of reaching a result are important to consider (Schwartz et al., 2020). The metric $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H$, is proposed and discussed in Section 1. However, reporting a single metric $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ is often ambiguous. Therefore, in our experiments, we consider the factors $E, D$, and $H$. To measure the computational cost per example $E$, Schwartz et al. (2020) propose a count of the floating point operations (FPOs) required. In our experiments, we adopt this metric and further include wall-clock time for a practical application. The component $D$ evaluates the quantity of training data needed to reach a given accuracy or the performance of a model in a low-resource scenario (Hedderich et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2021). Finally, the component $H$ measures the cost associated with hyperparameter tuning. This is reported using expected validation performance introduced by Dodge et al. $(2019,2021)$, which computes the validation performance one would yield in expectation after $k$ hyperparameter trials of random search (Bergstra and Bengio, 2012). Current literature does not focus on all facets of Green AI as formalized as $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$. Typically, improving efficiency involves making existing models more accessible. For example, improving accessibility through model distillation (Sanh et al., 2019) or adapter modules (Houlsby et al., 2019). Another avenue involves reducing the computational complexity, with examples: prompttuning (Schick and Sch\u00fctze, 2020), self-attention in Transformers (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020; Katharopoulos et al., 2020, et cetera). The latter approach is similar to our work. However, they focus the processing time of a single example $E$ and do not consider the other facets of Green AI. In our paper, we focus on MLP-based approaches, which we argue will have improvements in all facets of Green AI due to their simplicity. ## A. 2 MLP-based Models\n\nThe vision domain has seen promising results with purely MLP-based models (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), however, they lack the desired inductive biases for NLP. Some desirable properties for modeling language include: i) position invariance, which is important for generalization, ii) adaptive size for variable-length inputs, iii) a global receptive field, which allows interactions to not be limited to small token neighborhoods, iv) learnabilty allowing for universal applicablility to various tasks, and v) $d y$ namicity which implies that output is conditioned on the input. MLP-based models are typically not used for NLP as including the inductive biases of position invariance, adaptive size and global receptive field are non-trivial for MLPs. Several methods try to overcome the lack of adaptivity to size by introducing shifting operations and local windows. Yu et al. (2022) and Lian et al. (2022) uses spatial shifting to pass the information of adjacent tokens through an MLP. (Tang et al., 2021) uses a circular shifting operator. However, the position invariance is violated because positional information is required in the decision of which tokens are included in the neighborhood. The aggregation of local information itself is done via a (relative) position-specific MLP. Global interactions are modeled only through the inclusion of enough layers or through a hierarchical layout ( Yu et al., 2022; Guo et al., 2021). For vision tasks it can be useful to exploit the fact that 2 D images consist of two axes. Tatsunami and Taki (2021) make use of this fact by integrating a respective inductive bias. (Tu et al., 2022) achieve linear complexity by applying a gMLP (Liu et al., 2021) to only a single axis. A global receptive field in MLP-based models is achieved through token mixing and a weighted summation of the inputs, similar to self-attention. This allows for interaction between tokens. Liu et al. (2021) propose the model gMLP, where the mixing weights are determined by a fixed learnable interaction matrix between positions. However, this comes at the cost of violating position-invariance, size adaptivity, and dynamicity. DynaMixer (Wang et al., 2022) enables dynamicity by estimating the\nmixing weights from the concatenation of the inputs via a linear layer. This is efficient due to a dimensionality reduction step, but the concatenation still implies position-dependence and fixed-sized inputs. (Lee-Thorp et al., 2021) proposes the model FNet to use static Fourier transformations to model token interactions. This model made significant improvements in computation cost, although the functions lack learnability and are position dependent. ## A. 3 Hypernetworks\n\nA hypernetwork uses a network to generate the weights for another, often larger, network (Ha et al., 2016). Tay et al. (2021) leveraged task-conditioned hypernetworks for the GLUE benchmark. They achieved paralleled performance to the state-ofthe-art at the time, whilst being more parameter efficient. Karimi Mahabadi et al. (2021) applied hypernetworks to Transformers to allow for parameter sharing in multitask learning. Their results showed parameter efficiencies and improved out of domain generation. Zhmoginov et al. (2022) combine hypernetworks and transformers in the vision domain for few shot generalization. LambdaNets are strongly related to our work, as they generate linear functions from context, in a similar capacity to a hypernetwork (Bello, 2021). Their model is similar to the standard attention mechanism where the weights of three matrices $Q, K, V$ are learned. In contrast, HyperMixer uses the inputs to create non-linear transformations by generating an MLP. Features are combined based on their locations - a comparison can be found in Appendix E. Combining MLPMixer and hypernetworks allows for an efficient and simple MLP-based model to have all the necessary inductive biases for NLP. The MLPMixer provides a simple token interaction backbone. By deploying hypernetworks to build the weights of the token mixing MLP, the missing inductive biases of position invariance and size adaptation are obtained. ## B Experimental Details\n\n## B. 1 General Information\n\nImplementation We implemented all models within the same general framework based on PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019). An implementation of the layer is available at https://github.com/idiap/hypermixing. For tokenization, we use the pretrained tokenizer from\nBERT-Base (Devlin et al., 2019). Datasets are downloaded directly from HuggingFace Datasets (Lhoest et al., 2021). As such, they are directly downloaded by our training script. We apply no further preprocessing. For computing expected validation performance, we use the public implementation by Dodge et al. (2019). We run our experiments on single-GPU servers available to us as part of a computation grid, ranging between GeForce GTX Titan X and RTX 3090. Apart from Transformers on SNLI and MNLI, which take about 4 hours on slower GPUs, all experiments finished within 3 hours.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n4. Inference/generation results on 2 H 100 GPUs using tensor parallelism. All numbers taken with a batch size of 1 . Competing models were evaluated using vLLM (Kwon et al., 2023). language modeling capabilities of transformers but without this limitation. If this is possible it would enable significantly larger context lengths and much more efficient generation in terms of both FLOPs and memory required to store the KV cache. One line of work aiming to tackle this problem has been utilizing state-space models (Gu et al., 2021a, 2020, 2021b). State space models utilize a linear dynamical system approach to model language. Such a dynamical system maintains a constant size 'memory' which is maintained throughout the sequence which must encode all the information needed to predict the next token. Unlike RNNs however due to the linearity of the dynamics, SSMs can be written and computed as a convolution or a parallel scan enabling efficient forwarding in a long sequence like a transformer which enables training at scale. The key limitation of SSMs is the restricted form that the sequence mixing can take which enables efficient computation, as well as the compression of all information into a fixed size memory. This renders the expressive power of SSMs less than transformers in theory although it is unclear to what extent natural language requires the full expressive powers that transformers give. While early SSM models performed significantly worse than transformers recent models such as Mamba, and S6 have claimed to perform and scale on par, as have other SSM adjacent architecture such as Griffin (De et al., 2024), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023, 2024), and RetNets (Sun et al., 2023). These models are typically more expressive because they possess selective (input-dependent) gating and control of their internal dynamics, similar to the input dependence of the query, key and value vectors in a transformer. Recent work however has highlighted potential deficiencies of pure SSMs at in context learning and other algorithmic tasks and several groups have found that hybridizing SSMs with attention gives performance on par or exceeding transformers cite. While most of this work adds many attention layers, with Zamba we pose and show evidence for an interesting hypothesis - that one attention layer is all you need. ## B. Annealing\n\nWhile earlier works may have utilized a two-phase annealing schedule, but not disclosed it, the first work that openly dis- cussed in detail a two-phase schedule was miniCPM (Hu et al., 2024). They describe performing a first slow learning rate decay over the majority of pretraining data, followed by a more rapid decay over high-quality datasets, including instruct data. Since then, several other recently released models have explicitly or elliptically discussed annealing phases. These include Nemotron (Parmar et al., 2024b) and JetMoE (Shen et al., 2024), both claiming that annealing significantly improved model quality. After Zamba's initial release, OLMo 1.7 (AI2, 2024) also claimed to have performed annealing, which significantly improves the results on MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021), and utilized a linear scheduler based on a number of higher-quality dataset, such as wikipedia and flan-instruct. Zamba follows a similar approach, but utilizes a different dataset mix, as well as a faster exponential decay schedule and a learning-rate rewarmup from zero. ## C. Open checkpoints\n\nWhile releasing models with full checkpoints during training is rare, there are a number of works that have done so. The Pythia suite (Biderman et al., 2023) pioneered this approach and has been instrumental in many works on interpretability and training dynamics. However, trained for scientific purposes, Pythia models attain far from state of the art performance. Several more recent works also aim to open and democratize LLM pretraining by offering checkpoints and training details. These include OLMo (Groeneveld et al., 2024), who provide detailed training code and checkpoints for a 7B parameter model, and LLM360 (Liu et al., 2023), who provide descriptions of training and open-checkpoints models based on the Llama architecture. Additionally, for study of pure Mamba architectures, Zyphra released open checkpoints of a small 370m pure Mamba model trained on the Pile dataset (Zyphra, 2024). ## V. DISCUSSION\n\nIn this technical report, we introduce Zamba, a 7B opensource SSM highly competitive with leading models. We thus demonstrate conclusively the scalability of SSM architectures to this scale. Moreover, we utilize a novel architecture using\na shared global attention block which obtains the benefits of hybrid SSM-attention architectures while minimizing the parameters dedicated to attention. Moreover, we describe the two-phase training regime Zamba underwent and release both phase 1 (pretrained) and final (annealed) models. Zamba was trained on a relatively small budget of approximately $\\$ 200 \\mathrm{k}$ and a team of 7 researchers over the course of a month and approaches leading models in performance, thus demonstrating that approaching the state-of-the-art in LLM pretraining does not necessarily require vast budgets or teams and is not restricted only to a few leading companies. It is an interesting question what the source of the remaining gap between Zamba and the leading models at this scale is. The Zamba model trained until the end of phase 1 achieves Llama2 levels of performance from only 1 T tokens, while Llama2 was trained on at least 2 T tokens. This difference could arise from dataset differences, although given that Zamba's dataset is simply comprised of deduplicated open web datasets, it would be unlikely for Zamba's dataset to be significantly superior in quality to Llama2. It is also possible that our architecture gives us significant advantages over the Llama transformer architecture and indeed, despite claims that Mamba models struggle with ICL (Park et al., 2024), even our base model performs comparably to Llama2 here on MMLU, an evaluation metric which is known to require significant ICL to perform well. It is thus possible that even a single attention layer is enough to reach transformer parity on ICL. There is then the question of how to close the gap between Zamba and the leading open-weight models such as Mistral, Gemma, and Llama3. It is likely that some fraction of this gap is caused by a large disparity in the number of pretraining tokens. Our model is trained on only 1 T tokens vs 8 T for Gemma, 15T for Llama3, and an unknown (but likely similarly large) quantity for Mistral. Like others, and in accordance with the Chinchilla scaling laws, we observe continuing increases in performance (on a log scale) even towards the end of training, implying that our model has not plateaued in loss and could usefully be trained on many more tokens. Pretraining dataset quality is likely also a significant factor given that for our dataset, while utilizing existing well-known web datasets, we performed only straightforward filtering and deduplication, while there are many techniques for significantly improved dataset preparation available in the literature (Xie et al., 2024; Tirumala et al., 2024; Maini et al., 2024). We see significant improvements on many evaluation scores during the annealing phase, providing an independent replication of the claims of miniCPM (Hu et al., 2024). Given the significant jumps between base pretrained models such as Llama1, Llama2, and OLMo with relatively well-known datasets, and leading models in the 7B range such as Mistral and Gemma, it is likely that the augmentation of web data with synthetic, instruct, or other high quality data-sources played a key part in the performance of these models. This could either be during pretraining itself, as argued for by the phi series of models (Li et al., 2023; Abdin et al., 2024), or in an annealing phase similar to miniCPM and the one we performed. Empirically, we see that Zamba's annealing phase closes about half or more of the gap from Llama2 to state-ofthe-art models especially on more reasoning-like evaluations such as MMLU (Hendrycks et al., 2021) and ARC (Clark et al., 2018). It is possible that an improved annealing phase on significantly more synthetic data, or pretraining on significantly more tokens may close this gap. While several recent works have claimed to perform annealing, relatively little has yet been published on the exact methods used for this or the performance of the base model before annealing began. We demonstrate that annealing on high quality data can significantly improve a model from approximately a Llama2 level base to closing the gap with leading models. Understanding the extent to which this performance improvement is real and enhances the model's true capabilities or whether it is simply training the model to respond in a more evaluation-friendly manner remains to be elucidated. Moreover, many questions remain open such as the optimal annealing schedule, the optimal replay fraction of original pretraining data, and the optimal composition of the annealing datasets. We hope that by releasing our base model, and all annealing checkpoints, we can help the academic community begin answering these questions. With Zamba, by both validating the performance of Mamba at scale and by pioneering a novel architecture beyond that, we have also taken a step towards moving away from the standard transformer architecture for training state-of-the-art models. We believe that architectural innovations are relatively understudied given the success of the scaling paradigm. However, as the cost of training state-of-the-art models increases, and as the benefits of scaling data at the small scale become increasingly marginal, the possibility of constant gains from improved architectures and pretraining paradigms vs logarithmic ones from additional data become increasingly important in pushing forward the frontier in performance for smaller model size brackets. Finally, with Zamba, we make available all checkpoints during both the pretraining and annealing phase (one every 2500 steps) for scientific study. We believe that many scientific questions of deep interest for understanding the learning dynamics of such models can only be approached by studying the evolution of model weights during training and few academic groups have the budget or expertise to train models close to the state of the art. As such, we encourage other groups who train models at the frontier to consider making available and open the checkpoints of their models as well. ## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\n\nPaolo - Contributed to core infrastructure.

This is crucial for scaling the hypernetworks to larger models without excessive computational overhead.\n\n## Training Stability and Implementation\n\n- **Training Techniques**: The analysis notes the importance of advanced optimization methods, normalization techniques, and regularization to ensure training stability. References such as those on dynamic convolution and adaptive activation functions can provide insights into how to stabilize the training process.\n\n## Practical Implementation\n\n- **HyperMixer Implementation**: A deep dive into the HyperMixer architecture and its training procedures will be essential. Understanding how the hypernetwork generates MLP weights and how this can be adapted to the `SwiGluMLP` is a key next step.\n\n## Empirical Results and Compatibility\n\n- **Empirical Studies**: Gathering more empirical studies on the impact of dynamic MLPs in language models will help in validating the approach. Ensuring compatibility with the existing GAU structure and evaluating how the dynamic MLP fits within the overall model architecture is also crucial.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Adapt HyperMixer Concept**:\n   - Integrate the hypernetwork concept from HyperMixer into the `SwiGluMLP` to dynamically generate MLP weights, enhancing the model's expressiveness and adaptability.\n\n2. **Ensure Parameter Efficiency**:\n   - Use shared hypernetworks to generate weights, following the approach in Mahabadi et al., to maintain parameter efficiency and scalability.\n\n3. **Scalable HyperNetwork Designs**:\n   - Implement low-rank or efficient hypernetwork designs, such as LoGAH, to mitigate potential computational overhead when scaling to larger models.\n\n4. **Focus on Training Stability**:\n   - Employ advanced optimization methods, normalization techniques, and regularization to ensure stable training of the dynamic `SwiGluMLP`.\n\n5. **Prototype Development and Testing**:\n   - Develop a prototype of the dynamic `SwiGluMLP` with hypernetwork integration and conduct experiments to compare its performance with the baseline `SwiGluMLP` and other GAUs.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient novel LM block that leverages the strengths of hypernetworks to outperform existing state-of-the-art models.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

Summary of Analysis\n\nAfter reviewing the new search results, it is evident that integrating **HyperNetworks** into the `SwiGluMLP` GAU is a promising direction for enhancing the model's expressiveness and adaptability. The concept has been successfully applied in models like **HyperMixer**, which dynamically generates MLP weights using hypernetworks within an MLP-based architecture, achieving performance on par with Transformers at a lower computational cost. Additionally, research on parameter-efficient multi-task learning using shared hypernetworks and prompt-based task conditioning supports the feasibility of this approach. These insights suggest that modifying the `SwiGluMLP` to include dynamic weight generation via hypernetworks could improve performance on language modeling tasks while maintaining efficiency.\n\n## 2.

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3.

In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/47 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nHinton, G.

Hypernetwork-based Meta-Learning for Low-Rank Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Lightweight HyperNetwork Designs*\n\n*Woojin Cho, Kookjin Lee, Donsub Rim, Noseong Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** A lightweight low-rank PINNs containing only hundreds of model parameters and an associated hypernetwork-based meta-learning algorithm, which allows efficient approximation of solutions of PDEs for varying ranges of Pde input parameters, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** In various engineering and applied science applications, repetitive numerical simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) for varying input parameters are often required (e.g., aircraft shape optimization over many design parameters) and solvers are required to perform rapid execution. In this study, we suggest a path that potentially opens up a possibility for physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), emerging deep-learning-based solvers, to be considered as one such solver. Although PINNs have pioneered a proper integration of deep-learning and scientific computing, they require repetitive time-consuming training of neural networks, which is not suitable for many-query scenarios. To address this issue, we propose a lightweight low-rank PINNs containing only hundreds of model parameters and an associated hypernetwork-based meta-learning algorithm, which allows efficient approximation of solutions of PDEs for varying ranges of PDE input parameters. Moreover, we show that the proposed method is effective in overcoming a challenging issue, known as\"failure modes\"of PINNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. EfficientFormer: Vision Transformers at MobileNet Speed\n\n*From Search Query: Lightweight HyperNetwork Designs*\n\n*Yanyu Li, Geng Yuan, Yang Wen, Eric Hu, Georgios Evangelidis, S. Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Jian Ren*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proves that properly designed transformers can reach extremely low latency on mobile devices while maintaining high performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) have shown rapid progress in computer vision tasks, achieving promising results on various benchmarks. However, due to the massive number of parameters and model design, \\textit{e.g.}, attention mechanism, ViT-based models are generally times slower than lightweight convolutional networks. Therefore, the deployment of ViT for real-time applications is particularly challenging, especially on resource-constrained hardware such as mobile devices. Recent efforts try to reduce the computation complexity of ViT through network architecture search or hybrid design with MobileNet block, yet the inference speed is still unsatisfactory. This leads to an important question: can transformers run as fast as MobileNet while obtaining high performance? To answer this, we first revisit the network architecture and operators used in ViT-based models and identify inefficient designs. Then we introduce a dimension-consistent pure transformer (without MobileNet blocks) as a design paradigm. Finally, we perform latency-driven slimming to get a series of final models dubbed EfficientFormer. Extensive experiments show the superiority of EfficientFormer in performance and speed on mobile devices. Our fastest model, EfficientFormer-L1, achieves $79.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with only $1.6$ ms inference latency on iPhone 12 (compiled with CoreML), which runs as fast as MobileNetV2$\\times 1.4$ ($1.6$ ms, $74.7\\%$ top-1), and our largest model, EfficientFormer-L7, obtains $83.3\\%$ accuracy with only $7.0$ ms latency.

In this work, we analyze the limitations of the Point Transformer and propose our powerful and efficient Point Transformer V2 model with novel designs that overcome the limitations of previous work. In particular, we first propose group vector attention, which is more effective than the previous version of vector attention. Inheriting the advantages of both learnable weight encoding and multi-head attention, we present a highly effective implementation of grouped vector attention with a novel grouped weight encoding layer. We also strengthen the position information for attention by an additional position encoding multiplier. Furthermore, we design novel and lightweight partition-based pooling methods which enable better spatial alignment and more efficient sampling. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves better performance than its predecessor and achieves state-of-the-art on several challenging 3D point cloud understanding benchmarks, including 3D point cloud segmentation on ScanNet v2 and S3DIS and 3D point cloud classification on ModelNet40.

However, not much has been done on the front of investigating the effect of scaling properties of different inductive biases and model architectures. Do model architectures scale differently? If so, how does inductive bias affect scaling behaviour? How does this influence upstream (pretraining) and downstream (transfer)? This paper conducts a systematic study of scaling behaviour of ten diverse model architectures such as Transformers, Switch Transformers, Universal Transformers, Dynamic convolutions, Performers, and recently proposed MLP-Mixers. Via extensive experiments, we show that (1) architecture is an indeed an important consideration when performing scaling and (2) the best performing model can fluctuate at different scales.

In these situations, what is immediately available to vehicles is often only human operators. Empowering autonomous driving agents with the ability to navigate in a continuous and dynamic environment and to communicate with humans through sensorimotor-grounded dialogue becomes critical. To this end, we introduce Dialogue On the ROad To Handle Irregular Events (DOROTHIE), a novel interactive simulation platform that enables the creation of unexpected situations on the fly to support empirical studies on situated communication with autonomous driving agents. Based on this platform, we created the Situated Dialogue Navigation (SDN), a navigation benchmark of 183 trials with a total of 8415 utterances, around 18.7 hours of control streams, and 2.9 hours of trimmed audio. SDN is developed to evaluate the agent's ability to predict dialogue moves from humans as well as generate its own dialogue moves and physical navigation actions. We further developed a transformer-based baseline model for these SDN tasks. Our empirical results indicate that language guided-navigation in a highly dynamic environment is an extremely difficult task for end-to-end models. These results will provide insight towards future work on robust autonomous driving agents. The DOROTHIE platform, SDN benchmark, and code for the baseline model are available at https://github.com/sled-group/DOROTHIE.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6.

Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks, and demonstrates that this model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based architectures are the model of choice for natural language understanding, but they come at a significant cost, as they have quadratic complexity in the input length, require a lot of training data, and can be difficult to tune. In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Delta-STN: Efficient Bilevel Optimization for Neural Networks using Structured Response Jacobians\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability in HyperNetworks*\n\n*Roger Grosse, Juhan Bae*\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperparameter optimization of neural networks can be elegantly formulated as a bilevel optimization problem. While research on bilevel optimization of neural networks has been dominated by implicit differentiation and unrolling, hypernetworks such as Self-Tuning Networks (STNs) have recently gained traction due to their ability to amortize the optimization of the inner objective. In this paper, we diagnose several subtle pathologies in the training of STNs. Based on these observations, we propose the $\\Delta$-STN, an improved hypernetwork architecture which stabilizes training and optimizes hyperparameters much more efficiently than STNs. The key idea is to focus on accurately approximating the best-response Jacobian rather than the full best-response function; we achieve this by reparameterizing the hypernetwork and linearizing the network around the current parameters. We demonstrate empirically that our $\\Delta$-STN can tune regularization hyperparameters (e.g. weight decay, dropout, number of cutout holes) with higher accuracy, faster convergence, and improved stability compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations Improve Hypernetwork Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability in HyperNetworks*\n\n*Adrian Dalca, John Guttag, Jose Javier Gonzalez Ortiz*\n\n**Abstract:** Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 3.

The aim of PyXtal FF is to\npromote the application of atomistic simulations by providing several choices\nof structural descriptors and machine learning regressions in one platform.\nBased on the given choice of structural descriptors (including the\natom-centered symmetry functions, embedded atom density, SO4 bispectrum, and\nsmooth SO3 power spectrum), PyXtal FF can train the MLPs with either the\ngeneralized linear regression or neural networks model, by simultaneously\nminimizing the errors of energy/forces/stress tensors in comparison with the\ndata from the ab-initio simulation.

RoseNNa: A performant, portable library for neural network inference with application to computational fluid dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic MLPs in Language Models*\n\n*Spencer H. Bryngelson, Ajay Bati*\n\n**Abstract:** The rise of neural network-based machine learning ushered in high-level libraries, including TensorFlow and PyTorch, to support their functionality. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) researchers have benefited from this trend and produced powerful neural networks that promise shorter simulation times. For example, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent-based (RNN) architectures can represent sub-grid physical effects, like turbulence. Implementing neural networks in CFD solvers is challenging because the programming languages used for machine learning and CFD are mostly non-overlapping, We present the roseNNa library, which bridges the gap between neural network inference and CFD. RoseNNa is a non-invasive, lightweight (1000 lines), and performant tool for neural network inference, with focus on the smaller networks used to augment PDE solvers, like those of CFD, which are typically written in C/C++ or Fortran. RoseNNa accomplishes this by automatically converting trained models from typical neural network training packages into a high-performance Fortran library with C and Fortran APIs. This reduces the effort needed to access trained neural networks and maintains performance in the PDE solvers that CFD researchers build and rely upon. Results show that RoseNNa reliably outperforms PyTorch (Python) and libtorch (C++) on MLPs and LSTM RNNs with less than 100 hidden layers and 100 neurons per layer, even after removing the overhead cost of API calls. Speedups range from a factor of about 10 and 2 faster than these established libraries for the smaller and larger ends of the neural network size ranges tested.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating hypernetworks into the `SwiGluMLP` architecture to enhance model expressiveness, efficiency, and performance, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Key Goals and Objectives\n- **Integrate HyperNetworks**: The primary goal is to incorporate hypernetworks into the `SwiGluMLP` architecture to dynamically generate MLP weights, enhancing the model's expressiveness and adaptability.\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: Maintain or improve computational efficiency and model performance.\n- **Training Stability**: Ensure stable training processes despite the dynamic weight generation.\n- **Scalability**: Design the hypernetworks to be lightweight and scalable.\n\n## Useful References and Insights\n\n### HyperMixer\n- **Dynamic Weight Generation**: HyperMixer dynamically generates MLP weights using hypernetworks, achieving performance comparable to Transformers while being more data-efficient and computationally efficient.\n- **Implementation Details**: Studying the specific architectural choices and training procedures of HyperMixer can guide the adaptation to `SwiGluMLP`.\n\n### Training Stability and Optimization\n- **Normalization and Regularization**: Techniques such as normalization layers (e.g., LayerNorm), proper initialization, and regularization strategies are crucial for stabilizing training when using dynamic weight generation.\n- **Advanced Optimization Algorithms**: Researching methods like gradient descent on max-margin solutions can provide insights into optimizing the training process.\n\n### Lightweight and Scalable HyperNetworks\n- **Shared HyperNetworks**: Implementing shared hypernetworks can generate parameters efficiently, maintaining scalability and performance.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/36 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nTo show this, we consider a toy problem with 1 d sequences composed of shape pairs of different heights as described in Fleuret (2019). The target value is the average height in each pair of shapes. An example input is shown in Figure 5a. To solve the task well, for each position, the model must attend to other positions with the same shape. Models We compare the token mixing layer of HyperMixer to three other models: i) None does not model token interactions. All predictions are thus only made based on local information. This model should thus fail. ii) MLPMixer does model token interactions. Still, since its token mixing weights are position-specific, each position has to learn to recognize each shape, which we expect to be difficult, especially with little data. iii) Selfattention can be considered the upper bound, as it models the interaction between every two positions explicitly. Results Figure 5b shows the mean squared error on the test examples depending on the number of training examples. As expected, None fails on this task. While all other models are able to solve the task with enough training data, MLPMixer is considerably less data-efficient than the other two models, requiring 5-10 times more data to reach the same performance. This is expected, since in contrast to HyperMixer and self-attention, MLPMixer's token mixing module is not positioninvariant. HyperMixer and self-attention reach approximately the same performance when training on 100k examples. However, HyperMixer is more\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-08.jpg?height=1491&width=1577&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=240)\n\nFigure 5: Results and pseudo-attention maps on the synthetic task (Fleuret, 2019). data-efficient than self-attention, which we attribute to the simpler model architecture. We can measure the interactions between two tokens by computing the gradient of an output token with respect to an input token (pseudo-attention). Figures 5d and 5c show the pseudo-attention maps of HyperMixer in comparison to attention. We observe that the pseudo-attention weights of HyperMixer and attention are similar. This indicates that HyperMixer indeed learns an attention-like function. In contrast, we find these patterns to be weaker in MLPMixer (Figure 6, appendix). ## 5 Discussion\n\nIn the following, we first discuss the merits of our proposed model, which are the core contributions of our paper. We then discuss the scope of our analysis. ### 5.1 Impact\n\nBest all-MLP model HyperMixer was designed as an MLP-based architecture with similar inductive biases as Transformers, which are beneficial for natural language understanding. Our hypothesis (H1) is that this leads to improvements over other MLP-based methods. Our experimental results support this hypothesis, as we find HyperMixer to outperform all MLP-based baselines on all datasets (Section 4.3). Low cost model The main motivation for an MLP-based architecture is the efficiency benefits induced by its simplicity. Therefore, we hypothesized (H2) that HyperMixer would reduce the cost\n$\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ to obtain an AI result $R$. This hypothesis is supported by our experiments. While HyperMixer yields results that are on par with Transformer's results, it reduces the cost of all three cost factors: i) The cost of processing a single example (E) is lower, particularly for long inputs due to its linear complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of self-attention (Section 4.4). ii) The number of required training examples (D) is reduced, as HyperMixer's relative performance improvement is larger in the low-resource scenario (Section 4.5). iii) HyperMixer requires less hyperparameter tuning than Transformers to reach good results, which is demonstrated by HyperMixer's higher expected relative improvements at low tuning budgets (Section 4.6). Attention-like model Finally, our experiments on a synthetic task indicate that HyperMixer can learn very similar attention patterns as the selfattention mechanism in Transformers (Section 4.7), supporting hypothesis H3. While MLPMixer can also learn similar patterns given enough training data, we believe that it is the introduction of adequate biases that allows HyperMixer to learn these patterns efficiently. These biases were chosen based on an analysis of Transformer's success by Henderson (2020). HyperMixer's own success hence supports that analysis. In summary, in our study, HyperMixer is the bestperforming MLP-based architecture, and shows comparable performance and behavior as selfattention at substantially lower cost. HyperMixer can thus be considered a low cost alternative to Transformers. ### 5.2 Scope\n\nSmall resource scenario It is important to note that our study is limited to the small resource scenario: Our models are small, not pretrained on large general-purpose corpora, and trained on datasets with fewer than 1 million examples. It is unclear if our results will also hold on larger scale. For example, while gMLP and FNet perform poorly in the low-resource scenario as demonstrated in our experiments, both models are able to narrow the gap to Transformer-based models as the resources for pretraining increase (Liu et al., 2021; Lee-Thorp et al., 2021). We hypothesize that with enough resources, these models are able to overcome their shortcomings in terms of inductive biases. However, there is no reason to believe that\nHyperMixer, being equipped with useful inductive biases, wouldn't perform on par with Transformers in high-resource scenarios while retaining its lower overall cost. Quite the contrary, HyperMixer's linear complexity in sequence length perhaps makes it more appropriate for large-scale pretraining on long contexts than vanilla Transformers. Versatility One of the most impressive qualities of Transformers is their versatility: Not only are they now the standard architecture for all NLP tasks, but over the years they have also become ubiquitous in a wide range of applications domains outside of NLP. Of course, the present study cannot determine whether HyperMixer is as versatile as Transformers. However, subsequent studies have shown that HyperMixer has uses in speech recognition (Mai et al., 2023) and neural combinatorial optimization (Drakulic et al., 2023). Still, some modeling advancements are needed. For example, HyperMixing is not yet applicable for decoder models that make use of causal masking. As decoderonly language models have become widely studied, this constitutes promising future work. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWhile large pretrained Transformer language models have led to impressive progress, they require so much resources that many research labs are excluded from participation, leading to calls for Green AI. We have proposed an MLP-based method, HyperMixer, that, in contrast to previous MLP-based methods, is equipped with the same inductive biases that made Transformers so successful for natural language understanding. While it performs on par with Transformers, it incurs substantially lower cost in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning. Hence, we believe our study demonstrates the merits of MLP-based models for natural language understanding as an alternative to attention-based models, and we hope that the community pursues this direction further. Avenues for future work include large-scale pretraining, evaluation on a wider range of tasks and domains, and the model's adaptation to text generation. ## Limitations\n\nMany limitations of our study are already discussed in Section 5.2, however, we repeat and add to them explicitly here. Small resource scenario Our study investigates MLP-based architectures for text classification tasks and finds competitive performance with vanilla Transformers while having lower cost in terms of the Green AI equation. However, the scope of our findings is naturally limited to the testing scenario, which is low-resource: Our models are relatively small, not pretrained on large generalpurpose corpora, and trained on datasets with fewer than 1 million examples. We may not say with certainty that our results will also hold on larger scale. For the sake of hypothesis-driven research we consider it more valuable to run many controlled small-scale experiments rather than few large-scale experiments. Nonetheless, scaling up should certainly be part of future research directions, as this is essential for optimal task performance. Limitation to English pairwise sentence classification tasks Since token mixing is the independent variable in our study, we put our main focus on English sentence-pair classification tasks with textual input only, which we presume (and provide some evidence for) to be most useful to assess differences between token mixing models. Of course, vanilla Transformers are very flexible in the sense that, over the course of many studies, they have been shown to be very effective for a wide range of tasks, languages and data modalities. Whether or not the proposed HyperMixer model possesses similar flexibility cannot be answered in this study. The HyperMixer encoder arguably possesses similar inductive biases as Transformers. We thus expect it to be straight-forward to apply to tasks that are also solved well by Transformer encoders (e.g., span classification). For tasks such as language modeling, which involve a Transformer decoder, significant modeling advancements are required to obtain a HyperMixer equivalent. We consider this a very promising direction for future work. Limitation to MLP-based baselines Similar to a trend in the computer vision community, our study investigates the suitability of MLP-based architectures for NLP. Due to their conceptual simplicity, these models promise to be easier to train, potentially leading to reduced Green AI costs. To this end we compare our proposed HyperMixer model to a range of other MLP-based models, and Transformers. Apart from FNet and Linear Transformers, which are efficient Transformer alternatives, we do not attempt an exhaustive comparison to non-MLP-based efficient NLP models. Hence, the scope of our claims does not extend to all efficient Transformer models. However, these models are of course very relevant to this study, as they are targeted towards one of the factors of Green AI cost (single forward pass complexity). Therefore, we regard a comprehensive comparison as valuable future work. ## Acknowledgements\n\nFlorian Mai was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation under the project LAOS, grant number 200021_178862.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3. A comprehensive comparison of the cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ of HyperMixer and Transformers. (Sections: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6)\n4. An ablation demonstrating that HyperMixer learns attention patterns similar to Transformers. (Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Besides, we use torch.compile to accelerate both Transformer++ and DCFormer++. Results As shown in Table 6, The training overheads are generally larger than the inference overheads, and both decrease as the model scales. These overheads, though larger than the theoretical estimates in Table 2 and not negligible, are acceptable considering the performance gain, especially at larger scales. The overheads are mainly due to the I/O bottleneck caused by the series of operations on the attention matrices introduced by Compose, which are I/O bound instead of compute bound. Currently we implement training in pure JAX and inference in pure PyTorch without writing any custom kernels. We believe there is room for acceleration using FlashAttention-like tiling and kernel fusion techniques (Dao et al., 2022) and leave it for future work. ### 4.5. Image Classification\n\nBesides decoder-only transformer or language modeling, we apply DCMHA to Vision Transformer (ViT, an encoder-only transformer) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for image classification on the Imagined-1k dataset (ILSVRC-2012). Implementation and experimental settings are based on the Big Vision code base ${ }^{8}$. We use ViT-S/16 as the baseline model and equip it with DCMHA to obtain DCViT-S/16. We also compare with a 1.7x larger model ViT-M/16 (Table 7). We report top-1 and top-5 accuracy results in Table 8. DCViTS/16 outperforms ViT-S/16, on par with ViT-M/16 (though the accuracy differences at Epoch 300 between the three models are relatively small). Table 7.

We add each (groups of) component(s) separately to Transformer++ to study its effect and report the perplexity results in Table 9. Dynamic vs Static While static composition (static proj., Branch 1 in Figure 2 (b), also equivalent to Talking-Heads Attention (Shazeer et al., 2020)) is effective, the dynamic composition used by DCFormer++ (dyn. proj. + gate) improves much more, getting very close to +all Config, showing the critical role of dynamicity in increasing expressive power. Among dynamic composition components, low-rank projection (Branch 2 and 4 ) is more effective than gating (Branch 3 and 5), showing the importance of cross-head sharing. Query-wise vs Key-wise When acting alone, both querywise (Branch 2 and 3) and key-wise (Branch 4 and 5) compositions work surprisingly well, showing that query-wise and key-wise branches can work independently with little interaction between them, and that there may be some overlaps in their functions. Pre-compose vs Post-compose When acting alone, postcompose on attention weights is significantly more effective than pre-compose on attention scores, presumably because attention weights have a more direct impact on the final output of DCMHA module. This also reveals the shortages of existing works that only consider attention score composition (Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020). Impact of ranks There is slight performance gain when increasing the dynamic project rank $R$ from 1 to 2 , but further increasing the rank has no positive effect, validating the choice of $R=2$ in our work. Tradeoffs We explore two performance-efficiency tradeoffs that can further improve the efficiency of DCMHA: 1) in-\nTable 10. Performance and speed trade-offs for different speedup configs and models.(QW: Query-Wise, *: default config, ^ : querywise config in Table 9)\n\n| Local:Global Attn. | $1: 1^{*}$ | $3: 1$ | $7: 1$ | $1: 1 \\mathrm{QW}^{\\wedge}$ | $3: 1 \\mathrm{QW}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Pile Validation ppl |  |  |  |  |  |\n| DCFM++ 405M | 10.83 | 10.78 | 10.83 | 10.89 | 10.92 |\n| DCPythia-6.9B | 8.17 | 8.00 | 8.04 | 7.98 | 8.03 |\n| (1/10 steps) |  |  |  |  |  |\n\ncreasing the ratio of local:global attention layers and 2) only using query-wise composition. We train two models across scales (DCFormer++ 405M and DCPythia-6.9B) with different configs to quantify their impact on performance by measuring Pile validation ppl as shown in Table 10. For DCPythia-6.9B, we train only 13 K steps to save compute cost. We use Transformer++/DCFormer++ 6.9B in Table 6 to study the impact on training and inference efficiency. For inference speed we compare DCFormer++6.9B with two Transformer++6.9B baselines: one with all global attn and one with the same local:global attn ratio as DCFormer++. It can be observed from the table that increasing the local:global attn ratio from 1:1 to 7:1 improves training and inference efficiency without hurting performance. Only using query-wise composition also improves efficiency while slight degrading performance. The two approaches can also be combined, offering a spectrum of trade-offs. Specifically, combining $3: 1$ local:global attn with query-wise composition increases DCFormer++ 6.9B's training throughput ratio from $83.1 \\%$ to $92.5 \\%$, increases inference speed ratio from $94.5 \\% / 88.7 \\%$ to $103.3 \\% / 93.5 \\%$, while the ppl is slightly worse than the default DCFormer but still significantly better than the Transformer baseline. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nWe introduce a dynamic head composition mechanism to improve the MHA module of Transformers. Experimental results show that DCFormer is effective, efficient and scalable, significantly outperforming strong Transformer baselines, especially on the important language modeling task for foundation models. In the future, we would like to apply the idea of dynamic head composition to more architectures and domains, and to do more interpretability studies on DCMHA to gain a deeper understanding of its working mechanism. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Google Cloud for providing the compute for model training, and to Shun Wang for his technical support and help in troubleshooting TPU resource allocation and training. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents work on improving Transformer architecture by dynamically composing multi-head attention, which can boost performance of large language models with slight overhead.\n```\n\n#### 3. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/43 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 5484-5495, 2021.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Hanzhu Chen, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** COFT is proposed, a novelarse-to-Fine highligh\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts, leading to a superior performance over $30\\% in the F1 score metric.\n\n**Abstract:** Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on the knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over $30\\%$ in the F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 4. Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 6778  (*Influential: 1056*)\n\n#### 6. Stability Analysis and Generalization Bounds of Adversarial Training\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Jiancong Xiao, Yanbo Fan, Ruoyu Sun, Jue Wang, Zhimin Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are derived on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss and suggests that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\ep Silon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\ep silon T)$.\n\n**Abstract:** In adversarial machine learning, deep neural networks can fit the adversarial examples on the training dataset but have poor generalization ability on the test set. This phenomenon is called robust overfitting, and it can be observed when adversarially training neural nets on common datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In this paper, we study the robust overfitting issue of adversarial training by using tools from uniform stability. One major challenge is that the outer function (as a maximization of the inner function) is nonsmooth, so the standard technique (e.g., hardt et al., 2016) cannot be applied. Our approach is to consider $\\eta$-approximate smoothness: we show that the outer function satisfies this modified smoothness assumption with $\\eta$ being a constant related to the adversarial perturbation $\\epsilon$. Based on this, we derive stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss.

Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population\nmodels to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge\nof the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which\nrequires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this\nknowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit\nthe effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges,\nwe first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR\nadaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation\nperformance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting\n0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next\npropose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly\nindividualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of\natypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort\nand individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to\nout-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER\nreduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06T16:39:00Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-02T19:51:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Example-based Hypernetworks for Out-of-Distribution Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Tomer Volk, Eyal Ben-David, Ohad Amosy, Gal Chechik, Roi Reichart*\n\n**Abstract:** As Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms continually achieve new\nmilestones, out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge.\nThis paper addresses the issue of multi-source adaptation for unfamiliar\ndomains: We leverage labeled data from multiple source domains to generalize to\nunknown target domains at training. Our innovative framework employs\nexample-based Hypernetwork adaptation: a T5 encoder-decoder initially generates\na unique signature from an input example, embedding it within the source\ndomains' semantic space. This signature is subsequently utilized by a\nHypernetwork to generate the task classifier's weights. We evaluated our method\nacross two tasks - sentiment classification and natural language inference - in\n29 adaptation scenarios, where it outpaced established algorithms. In an\nadvanced version, the signature also enriches the input example's\nrepresentation. We also compare our finetuned architecture to few-shot GPT-3,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in essential use cases. To our knowledge, this\nmarks the first application of Hypernetworks to the adaptation for unknown\ndomains.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-27T11:10:10Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-18T19:30:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Methods of improving LLM training stability\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Oleg Rybakov, Mike Chrzanowski, Peter Dykas, Jinze Xue, Ben Lanir*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research\ntopic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for Multi-Style Controllable Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dongyeop Kang, Ryan Koo, Karin de Langis*\n\n**Abstract:** Textual style expresses a diverse set of information, including interpersonal dynamics (e.g., formality) and the author's emotions or attitudes (e.g., disgust). An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how best to combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style rewards, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect to style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Conditional Generative Models for Simulation of EMG During Naturalistic Movements\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dario Farina, Xiangyang Zhu, Xinjun Sheng, Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier, Kostiantyn Maksymenko, Alexander Kenneth Clarke, Shihan Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerical models of electromyographic (EMG) signals have provided a huge contribution to our fundamental understanding of human neurophysiology and remain a central pillar of motor neuroscience and the development of human-machine interfaces. However, whilst modern biophysical simulations based on finite element methods are highly accurate, they are extremely computationally expensive and thus are generally limited to modelling static systems such as isometrically contracting limbs. As a solution to this problem, we propose a transfer learning approach, in which a conditional generative model is trained to mimic the output of an advanced numerical model. To this end, we present BioMime, a conditional generative neural network trained adversarially to generate motor unit activation potential waveforms under a wide variety of volume conductor parameters. We demonstrate the ability of such a model to predictively interpolate between a much smaller number of numerical model's outputs with a high accuracy. Consequently, the computational load is dramatically reduced, which allows the rapid simulation of EMG signals during truly dynamic and naturalistic movements.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. HyperNetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*David Ha, Andrew Dai, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Abstract:** This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also\nknown as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.\nHypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in\nnature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a\nphenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in\nevolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and\nthus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful\nfor deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where\nhypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.\nOur main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM\nand achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling\ntasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and\nneural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for\nrecurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to\nconvolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition\ntasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer\nlearnable parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian*\n\n**Abstract:** Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data disparities across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ from any client observed during training.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. The Stability-Efficiency Dilemma: Investigating Sequence Length Warmup for Training GPT Models\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have demonstrated great success in pre-training large-scale autoregressive language models on massive GPUs. To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively. Experiments replicating GPT-3 model (125M) show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 40x larger learning rate, and retains 99% of the zero-shot accuracy on 11 tasks using 10x less data and 17x less time compared to the original GPT-3 training recipe, while the baseline diverges under the same settings and only retain 95% of accuracy under lower learning rate.\n\n**Conference:** curriculum-learning-a-regularization-method-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. Improving Training Stability for Multitask Ranking Models in Recommender Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Ed H. Chi, Lichan Hong, Xinyang Yi, Li Wei, Justin Gilmer, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Daryl Chang, Yoel Drori, Jiaxi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recommender systems play an important role in many content platforms. While most recommendation research is dedicated to designing better models to improve user experience, we found that research on stabilizing the training for such models is severely under-explored. As recommendation models become larger and more sophisticated, they are more susceptible to training instability issues, i.e., loss divergence, which can make the model unusable, waste significant resources and block model developments. In this paper, we share our findings and best practices we learned for improving the training stability of a real-world multitask ranking model for YouTube recommendations. We show some properties of the model that lead to unstable training and conjecture on the causes. Furthermore, based on our observations of training dynamics near the point of training instability, we hypothesize why existing solutions would fail, and propose a new algorithm to mitigate the limitations of existing solutions. Our experiments on YouTube production dataset show the proposed algorithm can significantly improve training stability while not compromising convergence, comparing with several commonly used baseline methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using HyperNetworks for dynamic weight generation, focusing on training stability and computational efficiency, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Dynamic Weight Generation with HyperNetworks\n\n- **HyperNetworks** can dynamically generate weights for neural networks based on the input data, which can enhance the expressiveness and adaptability of the model.

For ease of understanding, we provide pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. While the queries, keys, and values in HyperMixing need not be the same, we will\n\n[^1]assume they are identical in the following formulation. HyperMixing relies on the use of hypernetworks, which are used to generate the weights $\\mathbf{W}_{1}, \\mathbf{W}_{2}$ of TM-MLP (Equation 1) dynamically as a function of the input. Let $\\mathbf{x}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, j \\leq N$, where $N$ is the (variable) dimension of the input, represent token $j$ (i.e., query, key, and value). $\\mathbf{W}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{2}$ are generated by parameterized functions $h_{1}, h_{2}: \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d^{\\prime}}$. Theoretically, $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ could be any function, including sophisticated networks that consider non-linear interactions between tokens, such as the attention mechanism.

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2.

(Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Mogrifier LSTM (Avg. Score: 0.11)\n\n*Zihan Li, Fang Bai, Hongfu Zuo, Y. Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** Batteries (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods and is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Lithium-ion battery health and remaining useful life (RUL) are essential indicators for reliable operation. Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/23 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pages 1334-1345, 2018.

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nGalanti, T. and Wolf, L.

These networks rely heavily on the dot product attention operator, which computes the similarity between two points by taking their inner product. However, the inner product does not explicitly model the complex structural properties of real world datasets, such as hierarchies between data points. To remedy this, we introduce cone attention, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones. Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones, which intuitively measures the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it improves task-level performance over dot product attention and other baselines, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters. Our results suggest that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/31 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2103.02143, 2021.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Hanzhu Chen, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** COFT is proposed, a novelarse-to-Fine highligh\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts, leading to a superior performance over $30\\% in the F1 score metric.\n\n**Abstract:** Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on the knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over $30\\%$ in the F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population\nmodels to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge\nof the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which\nrequires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this\nknowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit\nthe effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges,\nwe first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR\nadaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation\nperformance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting\n0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next\npropose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly\nindividualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of\natypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort\nand individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to\nout-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER\nreduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06T16:39:00Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-02T19:51:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian*\n\n**Abstract:** Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data disparities across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ from any client observed during training.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for Multi-Style Controllable Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dongyeop Kang, Ryan Koo, Karin de Langis*\n\n**Abstract:** Textual style expresses a diverse set of information, including interpersonal dynamics (e.g., formality) and the author's emotions or attitudes (e.g., disgust). An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how best to combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style rewards, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect to style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Conditional Generative Models for Simulation of EMG During Naturalistic Movements\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dario Farina, Xiangyang Zhu, Xinjun Sheng, Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier, Kostiantyn Maksymenko, Alexander Kenneth Clarke, Shihan Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerical models of electromyographic (EMG) signals have provided a huge contribution to our fundamental understanding of human neurophysiology and remain a central pillar of motor neuroscience and the development of human-machine interfaces. However, whilst modern biophysical simulations based on finite element methods are highly accurate, they are extremely computationally expensive and thus are generally limited to modelling static systems such as isometrically contracting limbs. As a solution to this problem, we propose a transfer learning approach, in which a conditional generative model is trained to mimic the output of an advanced numerical model. To this end, we present BioMime, a conditional generative neural network trained adversarially to generate motor unit activation potential waveforms under a wide variety of volume conductor parameters. We demonstrate the ability of such a model to predictively interpolate between a much smaller number of numerical model's outputs with a high accuracy. Consequently, the computational load is dramatically reduced, which allows the rapid simulation of EMG signals during truly dynamic and naturalistic movements.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using HyperNetworks, dynamic weight generation, and the SwiGluMLP architecture, here are some key points and relevant information from the available sources:\n\n## Integration of HyperNetworks\n\n- HyperNetworks have been used to generate weights for other neural networks, which can enhance the adaptability and expressiveness of the model. In the context of language models, HyperNetworks can be integrated into MLP layers to dynamically generate weights, allowing the model to adapt to different input contexts and tasks.\n\n## Dynamic Weight Generation\n\n- Dynamic weight generation via HyperNetworks can significantly impact model expressiveness and adaptability. This approach allows the model to adjust its weights based on the input, which can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive models where the context changes with each token prediction. Research has shown that such dynamic weight generation can improve performance in various tasks by enabling the model to learn more flexible and context-dependent representations.\n\n## Training Stability\n\n- Ensuring training stability with dynamically generated weights is crucial. Techniques such as Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP) can help stabilize the training process. MIP involves parameterizing the weights in a way that maintains their magnitude, which can prevent exploding or vanishing gradients and improve the overall stability of the model.\n\n- Normalization strategies, such as RMSNorm, can also be effective in stabilizing the training process. These normalization techniques help in controlling the scale of the weights and activations, which is particularly important when dealing with dynamic weight generation.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n- The integration of HyperNetworks can introduce additional computational overhead due to the need to generate weights dynamically. To mitigate this, strategies such as low-rank approximations or efficient weight generation methods can be employed. For instance, using a shared MLP across all layers with only layer-dependent biases, as seen in the Movie Gen model, can reduce the number of parameters and improve efficiency.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Models\n\n- The proposed DynamicHyperMLP, which integrates HyperNetworks into the SwiGluMLP architecture, offers a unique approach compared to static MLPs or other dynamic mechanisms. This integration can potentially provide better adaptability and expressiveness compared to traditional static weight models. It is important to compare this approach with existing models like Transformers and other dynamic weight generation methods to identify its unique contributions and advantages.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Scalability and Parallelism**: When designing the model, ensuring that it can scale efficiently is crucial. The use of full bi-directional attention instead of causal attention, as in the Movie Gen Video model, can be beneficial for parallelization, although it may require adjustments to maintain the autoregressive nature of the model.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The choice of hyperparameters, such as the dimension of the feed-forward network (FFN), the number of attention heads, and the activation function, can significantly impact the performance of the model. Empirical tuning and comparison with existing models can help in identifying the optimal hyperparameters.\n\nBy integrating HyperNetworks into the SwiGluMLP architecture, the model can leverage dynamic weight generation to enhance its expressiveness and adaptability. Ensuring training stability through techniques like MIP and normalization, and optimizing computational efficiency through low-rank approximations or shared MLPs, are key steps in achieving a robust and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",

For ease of understanding, we provide pseudo-code in Algorithm 1. While the queries, keys, and values in HyperMixing need not be the same, we will\n\n[^1]assume they are identical in the following formulation. HyperMixing relies on the use of hypernetworks, which are used to generate the weights $\\mathbf{W}_{1}, \\mathbf{W}_{2}$ of TM-MLP (Equation 1) dynamically as a function of the input. Let $\\mathbf{x}_{j} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}, j \\leq N$, where $N$ is the (variable) dimension of the input, represent token $j$ (i.e., query, key, and value). $\\mathbf{W}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{W}_{2}$ are generated by parameterized functions $h_{1}, h_{2}: \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d^{\\prime}}$. Theoretically, $h_{1}$ and $h_{2}$ could be any function, including sophisticated networks that consider non-linear interactions between tokens, such as the attention mechanism. However, this would defeat the purpose of our model, which is simplicity. Therefore, we choose to generate the rows of the weight matrices from each token independently via another MLP. Concretely, a hypernetwork function can be defined as\n\\[\n\nh_{i}(\\mathbf{x})=\\left($$\n\\begin{array}{c}\n\\operatorname{MLP}^{\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{1}+\\mathbf{p}_{1}\\right) \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\n\\operatorname{MLP}^{\\mathbf{W}_{\\mathrm{i}}}\\left(\\mathbf{x}_{N}+\\mathbf{p}_{N}\\right)\n\\end{array}\n$$\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d^{\\prime}}\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{MLP}^{\\mathbf{W}_{1}}, \\mathrm{MLP}^{\\mathbf{W}_{2}}: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d^{\\prime}}$ are themselves multi-layer perceptrons with GELU nonlinearity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/36 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nIn the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures.

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3. A comprehensive comparison of the cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ of HyperMixer and Transformers. (Sections: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6)\n4. An ablation demonstrating that HyperMixer learns attention patterns similar to Transformers. (Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Score: 0.03)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Besides, we use torch.compile to accelerate both Transformer++ and DCFormer++. Results As shown in Table 6, The training overheads are generally larger than the inference overheads, and both decrease as the model scales. These overheads, though larger than the theoretical estimates in Table 2 and not negligible, are acceptable considering the performance gain, especially at larger scales. The overheads are mainly due to the I/O bottleneck caused by the series of operations on the attention matrices introduced by Compose, which are I/O bound instead of compute bound. Currently we implement training in pure JAX and inference in pure PyTorch without writing any custom kernels. We believe there is room for acceleration using FlashAttention-like tiling and kernel fusion techniques (Dao et al., 2022) and leave it for future work. ### 4.5. Image Classification\n\nBesides decoder-only transformer or language modeling, we apply DCMHA to Vision Transformer (ViT, an encoder-only transformer) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for image classification on the Imagined-1k dataset (ILSVRC-2012). Implementation and experimental settings are based on the Big Vision code base ${ }^{8}$. We use ViT-S/16 as the baseline model and equip it with DCMHA to obtain DCViT-S/16. We also compare with a 1.7x larger model ViT-M/16 (Table 7). We report top-1 and top-5 accuracy results in Table 8. DCViTS/16 outperforms ViT-S/16, on par with ViT-M/16 (though the accuracy differences at Epoch 300 between the three models are relatively small). Table 7.

We add each (groups of) component(s) separately to Transformer++ to study its effect and report the perplexity results in Table 9. Dynamic vs Static While static composition (static proj., Branch 1 in Figure 2 (b), also equivalent to Talking-Heads Attention (Shazeer et al., 2020)) is effective, the dynamic composition used by DCFormer++ (dyn. proj. + gate) improves much more, getting very close to +all Config, showing the critical role of dynamicity in increasing expressive power. Among dynamic composition components, low-rank projection (Branch 2 and 4 ) is more effective than gating (Branch 3 and 5), showing the importance of cross-head sharing. Query-wise vs Key-wise When acting alone, both querywise (Branch 2 and 3) and key-wise (Branch 4 and 5) compositions work surprisingly well, showing that query-wise and key-wise branches can work independently with little interaction between them, and that there may be some overlaps in their functions. Pre-compose vs Post-compose When acting alone, postcompose on attention weights is significantly more effective than pre-compose on attention scores, presumably because attention weights have a more direct impact on the final output of DCMHA module. This also reveals the shortages of existing works that only consider attention score composition (Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020). Impact of ranks There is slight performance gain when increasing the dynamic project rank $R$ from 1 to 2 , but further increasing the rank has no positive effect, validating the choice of $R=2$ in our work. Tradeoffs We explore two performance-efficiency tradeoffs that can further improve the efficiency of DCMHA: 1) in-\nTable 10. Performance and speed trade-offs for different speedup configs and models.(QW: Query-Wise, *: default config, ^ : querywise config in Table 9)\n\n| Local:Global Attn. | $1: 1^{*}$ | $3: 1$ | $7: 1$ | $1: 1 \\mathrm{QW}^{\\wedge}$ | $3: 1 \\mathrm{QW}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Pile Validation ppl |  |  |  |  |  |\n| DCFM++ 405M | 10.83 | 10.78 | 10.83 | 10.89 | 10.92 |\n| DCPythia-6.9B | 8.17 | 8.00 | 8.04 | 7.98 | 8.03 |\n| (1/10 steps) |  |  |  |  |  |\n\ncreasing the ratio of local:global attention layers and 2) only using query-wise composition. We train two models across scales (DCFormer++ 405M and DCPythia-6.9B) with different configs to quantify their impact on performance by measuring Pile validation ppl as shown in Table 10. For DCPythia-6.9B, we train only 13 K steps to save compute cost. We use Transformer++/DCFormer++ 6.9B in Table 6 to study the impact on training and inference efficiency. For inference speed we compare DCFormer++6.9B with two Transformer++6.9B baselines: one with all global attn and one with the same local:global attn ratio as DCFormer++. It can be observed from the table that increasing the local:global attn ratio from 1:1 to 7:1 improves training and inference efficiency without hurting performance. Only using query-wise composition also improves efficiency while slight degrading performance. The two approaches can also be combined, offering a spectrum of trade-offs. Specifically, combining $3: 1$ local:global attn with query-wise composition increases DCFormer++ 6.9B's training throughput ratio from $83.1 \\%$ to $92.5 \\%$, increases inference speed ratio from $94.5 \\% / 88.7 \\%$ to $103.3 \\% / 93.5 \\%$, while the ppl is slightly worse than the default DCFormer but still significantly better than the Transformer baseline. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nWe introduce a dynamic head composition mechanism to improve the MHA module of Transformers. Experimental results show that DCFormer is effective, efficient and scalable, significantly outperforming strong Transformer baselines, especially on the important language modeling task for foundation models. In the future, we would like to apply the idea of dynamic head composition to more architectures and domains, and to do more interpretability studies on DCMHA to gain a deeper understanding of its working mechanism. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Google Cloud for providing the compute for model training, and to Shun Wang for his technical support and help in troubleshooting TPU resource allocation and training. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents work on improving Transformer architecture by dynamically composing multi-head attention, which can boost performance of large language models with slight overhead.\n```\n\n#### 4. SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization (Avg.

However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\n2}$ | $\\mathbf{8 3 . 6}$ |\n\n### 5.4.

We first explore the impact of the simplified linear attention (SLA) module and progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN) on different backbones. As shown in Table 6, utilizing our simplified linear attention (SLA) brings consistent improvement for efficiency. For DeiT and PVT, our SLA obtains significant latency reduction and a few accuracy drop. Moreover, Swin transformers equipped with our SLA achieve quite comparable accuracy with that of original ones but with lower latency. In addition, the latency could be further reduced by replacing LayerNorm by our proposed progressive re-parameterized BatchNorm (PRepBN). This strategy hardly affects the accuracy and even recover the accuracy of model like DeiT and PVT. Combining these two strategies, the latency is reduced by 5.6 ms when the accuracy is improved by $0.2 \\%$ for DeiT-T. Moreover, our method obtains similar accuracy and harvests 2.2 ms and 2.4 ms latency reduction for Swin-T and Swin-S models. Ablation study for PRepBN.

To avoid the variance shift (Li et al., 2019) caused by droppath, which will influence the performance of BatchNorm, we simply set the droppath rate to 0 on DeiT-T model. As shown in Table 7, applying progressive strategy on a BatchNorm-based DeiTT model brings $1.2 \\%$ accuracy gain. We further utilize our RepBN in the model and the accuracy increases to $73.6 \\%$. These results demonstrate that both our proposed progressive strategy and re-parameterized BatchNorm (RepBN) are beneficial for training a pure BatchNorm-based transformer. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we investigates the computational bottleneck modules of transformer and propose novel strategies including progressive Re-parameterized BatchNorm and simplified linear attention to obtain efficient transformer architectures. Our method progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm during training to obtain lossless accuracy, while leveraging the efficiency advantages of BatchNorm during inference. Additionally, we devise a simplified linear attention mechanism that attains comparable performance with other linear attention methods but with less computational cost. Through extensive experiments for both computer vision and language modeling tasks, we showcase that our method achieves stronger performance with respect to accuracy and efficiency than prior methods and sheds light into the design of efficient transformer.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Tero Karras, Timo Aila, S. Laine, J. Lehtinen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new training methodology for generative adversarial networks is described, starting from a low resolution, and adding new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses, allowing for images of unprecedented quality.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 6778  (*Influential: 1056*)\n\n#### 3. Stability Analysis and Generalization Bounds of Adversarial Training\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Jiancong Xiao, Yanbo Fan, Ruoyu Sun, Jue Wang, Zhimin Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are derived on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss and suggests that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\ep Silon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\ep silon T)$.\n\n**Abstract:** In adversarial machine learning, deep neural networks can fit the adversarial examples on the training dataset but have poor generalization ability on the test set. This phenomenon is called robust overfitting, and it can be observed when adversarially training neural nets on common datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In this paper, we study the robust overfitting issue of adversarial training by using tools from uniform stability. One major challenge is that the outer function (as a maximization of the inner function) is nonsmooth, so the standard technique (e.g., hardt et al., 2016) cannot be applied. Our approach is to consider $\\eta$-approximate smoothness: we show that the outer function satisfies this modified smoothness assumption with $\\eta$ being a constant related to the adversarial perturbation $\\epsilon$. Based on this, we derive stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss. Our results suggest that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\epsilon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon T)$. This phenomenon is also observed in practice. Additionally, we show that a few popular techniques for adversarial training (e.g., early stopping, cyclic learning rate, and stochastic weight averaging) are stability-promoting in theory.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

Merging Experts into One: Improving Computational Efficiency of Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Shwai He, Run-Ze Fan, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Tianyi Zhou, D. Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates the superiority of selecting multiple experts and proposes a computation-efficient approach called merging Experts into One (MEO), which reduces the computation cost to that of a single expert.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling the size of language models usually leads to remarkable advancements in NLP tasks. But it often comes with a price of growing computational cost. Although a sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) can reduce the cost by activating a small subset of parameters (e.g., one expert) for each input, its computation escalates significantly if increasing the number of activated experts, limiting its practical utility. Can we retain the advantages of adding more experts without substantially increasing the computational costs? In this paper, we first demonstrate the superiority of selecting multiple experts and then propose a computation-efficient approach called \\textbf{\\texttt{Merging Experts into One}} (MEO), which reduces the computation cost to that of a single expert. Extensive experiments show that MEO significantly improves computational efficiency, e.g., FLOPS drops from 72.0G of vanilla MoE to 28.6G (MEO). Moreover, we propose a token-level attention block that further enhances the efficiency and performance of token-level MEO, e.g., 83.3\\% (MEO) vs. 82.6\\% (vanilla MoE) average score on the GLUE benchmark.

Random Exploration in Bayesian Optimization: Order-Optimal Regret and Computational Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Sudeep Salgia, Sattar Vakili, Qing Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithm based on random exploration with domain shrinking and establish its order-optimal regret guarantees under both noise-free and noisy settings is developed and enjoys a computational advantage over prevailing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider Bayesian optimization using Gaussian Process models, also referred to as kernel-based bandit optimization. We study the methodology of exploring the domain using random samples drawn from a distribution. We show that this random exploration approach achieves the optimal error rates. Our analysis is based on novel concentration bounds in an infinite dimensional Hilbert space established in this work, which may be of independent interest. We further develop an algorithm based on random exploration with domain shrinking and establish its order-optimal regret guarantees under both noise-free and noisy settings. In the noise-free setting, our analysis closes the existing gap in regret performance and thereby resolves a COLT open problem. The proposed algorithm also enjoys a computational advantage over prevailing methods due to the random exploration that obviates the expensive optimization of a non-convex acquisition function for choosing the query points at each iteration.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Improving Computational Efficiency in Visual Reinforcement Learning via Stored Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Lili Chen, Kimin Lee, A. Srinivas, P. Abbeel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stored Embeddings for Efficient Reinforcement Learning (SEER) is presented, a simple modification of existing off-policy RL methods to address computational and memory requirements of convolutional neural networks and experience replay.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL) have led to impressive success in complex tasks from visual observations. Experience replay improves sample-efficiency by reusing experiences from the past, and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) process high-dimensional inputs effectively. However, such techniques demand high memory and computational bandwidth. In this paper, we present Stored Embeddings for Efficient Reinforcement Learning (SEER), a simple modification of existing off-policy RL methods, to address these computational and memory requirements. To reduce the computational overhead of gradient updates in CNNs, we freeze the lower layers of CNN encoders early in training due to early convergence of their parameters. Additionally, we reduce memory requirements by storing the low-dimensional latent vectors for experience replay instead of high-dimensional images, enabling an adaptive increase in the replay buffer capacity, a useful technique in constrained-memory settings. In our experiments, we show that SEER does not degrade the performance of RL agents while significantly saving computation and memory across a diverse set of DeepMind Control environments and Atari games.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population\nmodels to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge\nof the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which\nrequires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this\nknowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit\nthe effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges,\nwe first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR\nadaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation\nperformance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting\n0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next\npropose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly\nindividualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of\natypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort\nand individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to\nout-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER\nreduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06T16:39:00Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-02T19:51:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Example-based Hypernetworks for Out-of-Distribution Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Tomer Volk, Eyal Ben-David, Ohad Amosy, Gal Chechik, Roi Reichart*\n\n**Abstract:** As Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms continually achieve new\nmilestones, out-of-distribution generalization remains a significant challenge.\nThis paper addresses the issue of multi-source adaptation for unfamiliar\ndomains: We leverage labeled data from multiple source domains to generalize to\nunknown target domains at training. Our innovative framework employs\nexample-based Hypernetwork adaptation: a T5 encoder-decoder initially generates\na unique signature from an input example, embedding it within the source\ndomains' semantic space. This signature is subsequently utilized by a\nHypernetwork to generate the task classifier's weights. We evaluated our method\nacross two tasks - sentiment classification and natural language inference - in\n29 adaptation scenarios, where it outpaced established algorithms. In an\nadvanced version, the signature also enriches the input example's\nrepresentation. We also compare our finetuned architecture to few-shot GPT-3,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in essential use cases. To our knowledge, this\nmarks the first application of Hypernetworks to the adaptation for unknown\ndomains.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-27T11:10:10Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-18T19:30:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Methods of improving LLM training stability\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Oleg Rybakov, Mike Chrzanowski, Peter Dykas, Jinze Xue, Ben Lanir*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research\ntopic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. PairConnect: A Compute-Efficient MLP Alternative to Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Zhaozhuo Xu, Minghao Yan, Junyan Zhang, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have demonstrated superior performance in natural language\nprocessing. The dot product self-attention in Transformer allows us to model\ninteractions between words. However, this modeling comes with significant\ncomputational overhead. In this work, we revisit the memory-compute trade-off\nassociated with Transformer, particularly multi-head attention, and show a\nmemory-heavy but significantly more compute-efficient alternative to\nTransformer. Our proposal, denoted as PairConnect, a multilayer perceptron\n(MLP), models the pairwise interaction between words by explicit pairwise word\nembeddings. As a result, PairConnect substitutes self dot product with a simple\nembedding lookup. We show mathematically that despite being an MLP, our\ncompute-efficient PairConnect is strictly more expressive than Transformer. Our\nexperiment on language modeling tasks suggests that PairConnect could achieve\ncomparable results with Transformer while reducing the computational cost\nassociated with inference significantly.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-15T15:39:45Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-15T15:39:45Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

In\nthis paper, we provide the winning solution to the NeurIPS 2019 MicroNet\nChallenge in the language modeling track. Compared to the baseline language\nmodel provided by the MicroNet Challenge, our model is 90 times more\nparameter-efficient and 36 times more computation-efficient while achieving the\nrequired test perplexity of 35 on the Wikitext-103 dataset.

HyperNetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*David Ha, Andrew Dai, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Abstract:** This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also\nknown as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.\nHypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in\nnature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a\nphenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in\nevolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and\nthus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful\nfor deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where\nhypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.\nOur main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM\nand achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling\ntasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and\nneural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for\nrecurrent networks.

Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian*\n\n**Abstract:** Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data disparities across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ from any client observed during training.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Stability-Efficiency Dilemma: Investigating Sequence Length Warmup for Training GPT Models\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have demonstrated great success in pre-training large-scale autoregressive language models on massive GPUs. To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively. Experiments replicating GPT-3 model (125M) show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 40x larger learning rate, and retains 99% of the zero-shot accuracy on 11 tasks using 10x less data and 17x less time compared to the original GPT-3 training recipe, while the baseline diverges under the same settings and only retain 95% of accuracy under lower learning rate.\n\n**Conference:** curriculum-learning-a-regularization-method-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-13\n\n\n\n#### 4. Improving Training Stability for Multitask Ranking Models in Recommender Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Ed H. Chi, Lichan Hong, Xinyang Yi, Li Wei, Justin Gilmer, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Daryl Chang, Yoel Drori, Jiaxi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recommender systems play an important role in many content platforms. While most recommendation research is dedicated to designing better models to improve user experience, we found that research on stabilizing the training for such models is severely under-explored. As recommendation models become larger and more sophisticated, they are more susceptible to training instability issues, i.e., loss divergence, which can make the model unusable, waste significant resources and block model developments. In this paper, we share our findings and best practices we learned for improving the training stability of a real-world multitask ranking model for YouTube recommendations. We show some properties of the model that lead to unstable training and conjecture on the causes. Furthermore, based on our observations of training dynamics near the point of training instability, we hypothesize why existing solutions would fail, and propose a new algorithm to mitigate the limitations of existing solutions. Our experiments on YouTube production dataset show the proposed algorithm can significantly improve training stability while not compromising convergence, comparing with several commonly used baseline methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. SqueezeBERT: What can computer vision teach NLP about efficient neural networks?\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Forrest N. Iandola, Ravi Krishna, Kurt W. Keutzer, Albert E. Shaw*\n\n**Abstract:** Humans read and write hundreds of billions of messages every day. Further, due to the availability of large datasets, large computing systems, and better neural network models, natural language processing (NLP) technology has made significant strides in understanding, proofreading, and organizing these messages. Thus, there is a significant opportunity to deploy NLP in myriad applications to help web users, social networks, and businesses. In particular, we consider smartphones and other mobile devices as crucial platforms for deploying NLP models at scale. However, today's highly-accurate NLP neural network models such as BERT and RoBERTa are extremely computationally expensive, with BERT-base taking 1.7 seconds to classify a text snippet on a Pixel 3 smartphone. In this work, we observe that methods such as grouped convolutions have yielded significant speedups for computer vision networks, but many of these techniques have not been adopted by NLP neural network designers. We demonstrate how to replace several operations in self-attention layers with grouped convolutions, and we use this technique in a novel network architecture called SqueezeBERT, which runs 4.3x faster than BERT-base on the Pixel 3 while achieving competitive accuracy on the GLUE test set. The SqueezeBERT code will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-sustainlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-19\n\n\n\n#### 6. Sample and Computation Redistribution for Efficient Face Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Computational Efficiency*\n\n*Stefanos Zafeiriou, Alexandros Lattas, Jiankang Deng, Jia Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Although tremendous strides have been made in uncontrolled face detection, efficient face detection with a low computation cost as well as high precision remains an open challenge. In this paper, we point out that training data sampling and computation distribution strategies are the keys to efficient and accurate face detection. Motivated by these observations, we introduce two simple but effective methods (1) Sample Redistribution (SR), which augments training samples for the most needed stages, based on the statistics of benchmark datasets; and (2) Computation Redistribution (CR), which reallocates the computation between the backbone, neck and head of the model, based on a meticulously defined search methodology. Extensive experiments conducted on WIDER FACE demonstrate the state-of-the-art efficiency-accuracy trade-off for the proposed \\scrfd family across a wide range of compute regimes. In particular, \\scrfdf{34} outperforms the best competitor, TinaFace, by $3.86\\%$ (AP at hard set) while being more than \\emph{3$\\times$ faster} on GPUs with VGA-resolution images. We also release our code to facilitate future research.\n\n**Conference:** sample-and-computation-redistribution-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using HyperNetworks, focusing on training stability, computational efficiency, and dynamic weight generation, here are some key points and strategies that can be considered:\n\n## Dynamic Weight Generation\n- HyperNetworks can dynamically generate weights for the main network based on the input context, which is particularly beneficial in autoregressive models where the context changes with each token prediction. This approach has been shown to enhance expressiveness and adaptability in models like HyperMixer, which uses HyperNetworks to form token mixing MLPs, achieving results comparable to Transformers at lower costs.\n\n## Training Stability\n- To ensure stable training, techniques such as Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP) and normalization strategies like RMSNorm are crucial. These methods help maintain the magnitude of weights, preventing issues with gradients and exploding or vanishing gradients. Normalization strategies can stabilize the training process by keeping the weights within a manageable range.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n- While HyperNetworks introduce additional computational steps, several strategies can mitigate this overhead:\n  - **Low-Rank Approximations**: Using low-rank approximations for the weight matrices generated by HyperNetworks can reduce computational complexity without significantly compromising performance.\n  - **Shared MLPs**: Employing shared MLPs across different layers or tasks can also help in reducing the computational overhead associated with HyperNetworks.\n  - **Efficient Weight Generation**: Methods like using a hypernetwork to generate parameters for another neural network, as seen in conditional diffusion models, can be optimized to ensure efficient weight generation. This involves conditioning the generation process on specific tasks to produce optimized parameters.\n\n## Empirical Results and Case Studies\n- Studies have shown that HyperNetworks can be effective in multi-task learning scenarios. For example, shared HyperNetworks can generate adapter parameters for multiple tasks, improving multi-task learning efficiency.

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3. A comprehensive comparison of the cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ of HyperMixer and Transformers. (Sections: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6)\n4. An ablation demonstrating that HyperMixer learns attention patterns similar to Transformers. (Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.42)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/38 (Score: 0.42)*\n\n```\n5 \\%}$ | $151 / 164$ | $133 \\times \\mathbf{8 7 . 9 \\%} / 81.1 \\%$ |\n| 6.9B | 201 | $167 \\times \\mathbf{8 3 . 1 \\%}$ | $83.2 / 88.7$ | $78.6 \\times \\mathbf{9 4 . 5 \\%} / 88.7 \\%$ |\n| 13B | 203 | $171 \\times \\mathbf{8 4 . 4 \\%}$ | $45.5 / 48.1$ | $43.3 \\times \\mathbf{9 5 . 1 \\%} / 89.9 \\%$ |\n| 33B | 84 | $75 \\times \\mathbf{8 9 . 2 \\%}$ | $19.9 / 21.0$ | $18.9 \\times \\mathbf{9 4 . 8 \\%} / 89.7 \\%$ |\n\nble by the row plus column decomposition (Section 3.1) because query-wise and key-wise computation are independent. Besides, we use torch.compile to accelerate both Transformer++ and DCFormer++. Results As shown in Table 6, The training overheads are generally larger than the inference overheads, and both decrease as the model scales. These overheads, though larger than the theoretical estimates in Table 2 and not negligible, are acceptable considering the performance gain, especially at larger scales. The overheads are mainly due to the I/O bottleneck caused by the series of operations on the attention matrices introduced by Compose, which are I/O bound instead of compute bound. Currently we implement training in pure JAX and inference in pure PyTorch without writing any custom kernels. We believe there is room for acceleration using FlashAttention-like tiling and kernel fusion techniques (Dao et al., 2022) and leave it for future work. ### 4.5. Image Classification\n\nBesides decoder-only transformer or language modeling, we apply DCMHA to Vision Transformer (ViT, an encoder-only transformer) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020) for image classification on the Imagined-1k dataset (ILSVRC-2012). Implementation and experimental settings are based on the Big Vision code base ${ }^{8}$. We use ViT-S/16 as the baseline model and equip it with DCMHA to obtain DCViT-S/16. We also compare with a 1.7x larger model ViT-M/16 (Table 7). We report top-1 and top-5 accuracy results in Table 8. DCViTS/16 outperforms ViT-S/16, on par with ViT-M/16 (though the accuracy differences at Epoch 300 between the three models are relatively small). Table 7.

We add each (groups of) component(s) separately to Transformer++ to study its effect and report the perplexity results in Table 9. Dynamic vs Static While static composition (static proj., Branch 1 in Figure 2 (b), also equivalent to Talking-Heads Attention (Shazeer et al., 2020)) is effective, the dynamic composition used by DCFormer++ (dyn. proj. + gate) improves much more, getting very close to +all Config, showing the critical role of dynamicity in increasing expressive power. Among dynamic composition components, low-rank projection (Branch 2 and 4 ) is more effective than gating (Branch 3 and 5), showing the importance of cross-head sharing. Query-wise vs Key-wise When acting alone, both querywise (Branch 2 and 3) and key-wise (Branch 4 and 5) compositions work surprisingly well, showing that query-wise and key-wise branches can work independently with little interaction between them, and that there may be some overlaps in their functions. Pre-compose vs Post-compose When acting alone, postcompose on attention weights is significantly more effective than pre-compose on attention scores, presumably because attention weights have a more direct impact on the final output of DCMHA module. This also reveals the shortages of existing works that only consider attention score composition (Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020). Impact of ranks There is slight performance gain when increasing the dynamic project rank $R$ from 1 to 2 , but further increasing the rank has no positive effect, validating the choice of $R=2$ in our work. Tradeoffs We explore two performance-efficiency tradeoffs that can further improve the efficiency of DCMHA: 1) in-\nTable 10. Performance and speed trade-offs for different speedup configs and models.(QW: Query-Wise, *: default config, ^ : querywise config in Table 9)\n\n| Local:Global Attn. | $1: 1^{*}$ | $3: 1$ | $7: 1$ | $1: 1 \\mathrm{QW}^{\\wedge}$ | $3: 1 \\mathrm{QW}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Pile Validation ppl |  |  |  |  |  |\n| DCFM++ 405M | 10.83 | 10.78 | 10.83 | 10.89 | 10.92 |\n| DCPythia-6.9B | 8.17 | 8.00 | 8.04 | 7.98 | 8.03 |\n| (1/10 steps) |  |  |  |  |  |\n\ncreasing the ratio of local:global attention layers and 2) only using query-wise composition. We train two models across scales (DCFormer++ 405M and DCPythia-6.9B) with different configs to quantify their impact on performance by measuring Pile validation ppl as shown in Table 10. For DCPythia-6.9B, we train only 13 K steps to save compute cost. We use Transformer++/DCFormer++ 6.9B in Table 6 to study the impact on training and inference efficiency. For inference speed we compare DCFormer++6.9B with two Transformer++6.9B baselines: one with all global attn and one with the same local:global attn ratio as DCFormer++. It can be observed from the table that increasing the local:global attn ratio from 1:1 to 7:1 improves training and inference efficiency without hurting performance. Only using query-wise composition also improves efficiency while slight degrading performance. The two approaches can also be combined, offering a spectrum of trade-offs. Specifically, combining $3: 1$ local:global attn with query-wise composition increases DCFormer++ 6.9B's training throughput ratio from $83.1 \\%$ to $92.5 \\%$, increases inference speed ratio from $94.5 \\% / 88.7 \\%$ to $103.3 \\% / 93.5 \\%$, while the ppl is slightly worse than the default DCFormer but still significantly better than the Transformer baseline. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nWe introduce a dynamic head composition mechanism to improve the MHA module of Transformers. Experimental results show that DCFormer is effective, efficient and scalable, significantly outperforming strong Transformer baselines, especially on the important language modeling task for foundation models. In the future, we would like to apply the idea of dynamic head composition to more architectures and domains, and to do more interpretability studies on DCMHA to gain a deeper understanding of its working mechanism. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe are grateful to Google Cloud for providing the compute for model training, and to Shun Wang for his technical support and help in troubleshooting TPU resource allocation and training. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents work on improving Transformer architecture by dynamically composing multi-head attention, which can boost performance of large language models with slight overhead.\n```\n\n#### 3. SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/43 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2021 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. 5484-5495, 2021.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Coarse-to-Fine Highlighting: Reducing Knowledge Hallucination in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Qitan Lv, Jie Wang, Hanzhu Chen, Bin Li, Yongdong Zhang, Feng Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** COFT is proposed, a novelarse-to-Fine highligh\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts, leading to a superior performance over $30\\% in the F1 score metric.\n\n**Abstract:** Generation of plausible but incorrect factual information, often termed hallucination, has attracted significant research interest. Retrieval-augmented language model (RALM) -- which enhances models with up-to-date knowledge -- emerges as a promising method to reduce hallucination. However, existing RALMs may instead exacerbate hallucination when retrieving lengthy contexts. To address this challenge, we propose COFT, a novel \\textbf{CO}arse-to-\\textbf{F}ine highligh\\textbf{T}ing method to focus on different granularity-level key texts, thereby avoiding getting lost in lengthy contexts. Specifically, COFT consists of three components: \\textit{recaller}, \\textit{scorer}, and \\textit{selector}. First, \\textit{recaller} applies a knowledge graph to extract potential key entities in a given context. Second, \\textit{scorer} measures the importance of each entity by calculating its contextual weight. Finally, \\textit{selector} selects high contextual weight entities with a dynamic threshold algorithm and highlights the corresponding paragraphs, sentences, or words in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments on the knowledge hallucination benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of COFT, leading to a superior performance over $30\\%$ in the F1 score metric. Moreover, COFT also exhibits remarkable versatility across various long-form tasks, such as reading comprehension and question answering.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Our approach uses a 4D dynamic Neural Radiance Field (NeRF), which is optimized for scene appearance, density, and motion consistency by querying a Text-to-Video (T2V) diffusion-based model. The dynamic video output generated from the provided text can be viewed from any camera location and angle, and can be composited into any 3D environment. MAV3D does not require any 3D or 4D data and the T2V model is trained only on Text-Image pairs and unlabeled videos. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach using comprehensive quantitative and qualitative experiments and show an improvement over previously established internal baselines. To the best of our knowledge, our method is the first to generate 3D dynamic scenes given a text description.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 4. Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Tero Karras, Timo Aila, S. Laine, J. Lehtinen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new training methodology for generative adversarial networks is described, starting from a low resolution, and adding new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses, allowing for images of unprecedented quality.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a new training methodology for generative adversarial networks. The key idea is to grow both the generator and discriminator progressively: starting from a low resolution, we add new layers that model increasingly fine details as training progresses. This both speeds the training up and greatly stabilizes it, allowing us to produce images of unprecedented quality, e.g., CelebA images at 1024^2. We also propose a simple way to increase the variation in generated images, and achieve a record inception score of 8.80 in unsupervised CIFAR10. Additionally, we describe several implementation details that are important for discouraging unhealthy competition between the generator and discriminator. Finally, we suggest a new metric for evaluating GAN results, both in terms of image quality and variation. As an additional contribution, we construct a higher-quality version of the CelebA dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 6778  (*Influential: 1056*)\n\n#### 6. Stability Analysis and Generalization Bounds of Adversarial Training\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Jiancong Xiao, Yanbo Fan, Ruoyu Sun, Jue Wang, Zhimin Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are derived on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss and suggests that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\ep Silon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\ep silon T)$.\n\n**Abstract:** In adversarial machine learning, deep neural networks can fit the adversarial examples on the training dataset but have poor generalization ability on the test set. This phenomenon is called robust overfitting, and it can be observed when adversarially training neural nets on common datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In this paper, we study the robust overfitting issue of adversarial training by using tools from uniform stability. One major challenge is that the outer function (as a maximization of the inner function) is nonsmooth, so the standard technique (e.g., hardt et al., 2016) cannot be applied. Our approach is to consider $\\eta$-approximate smoothness: we show that the outer function satisfies this modified smoothness assumption with $\\eta$ being a constant related to the adversarial perturbation $\\epsilon$. Based on this, we derive stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss. Our results suggest that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\epsilon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon T)$. This phenomenon is also observed in practice. Additionally, we show that a few popular techniques for adversarial training (e.g., early stopping, cyclic learning rate, and stochastic weight averaging) are stability-promoting in theory.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7.

Hypernetworks for Personalizing ASR to Atypical Speech\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Max M\u00fcller-Eberstein, Dianna Yee, Karren Yang, Gautam Varma Mantena, Colin Lea*\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) for personalizing automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) has recently shown promise for adapting general population\nmodels to atypical speech. However, these approaches assume a priori knowledge\nof the atypical speech disorder being adapted for -- the diagnosis of which\nrequires expert knowledge that is not always available. Even given this\nknowledge, data scarcity and high inter/intra-speaker variability further limit\nthe effectiveness of traditional fine-tuning. To circumvent these challenges,\nwe first identify the minimal set of model parameters required for ASR\nadaptation. Our analysis of each individual parameter's effect on adaptation\nperformance allows us to reduce Word Error Rate (WER) by half while adapting\n0.03% of all weights. Alleviating the need for cohort-specific models, we next\npropose the novel use of a meta-learned hypernetwork to generate highly\nindividualized, utterance-level adaptations on-the-fly for a diverse set of\natypical speech characteristics. Evaluating adaptation at the global, cohort\nand individual-level, we show that hypernetworks generalize better to\nout-of-distribution speakers, while maintaining an overall relative WER\nreduction of 75.2% using 0.1% of the full parameter budget.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-06T16:39:00Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-02T19:51:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Our innovative framework employs\nexample-based Hypernetwork adaptation: a T5 encoder-decoder initially generates\na unique signature from an input example, embedding it within the source\ndomains' semantic space. This signature is subsequently utilized by a\nHypernetwork to generate the task classifier's weights. We evaluated our method\nacross two tasks - sentiment classification and natural language inference - in\n29 adaptation scenarios, where it outpaced established algorithms. In an\nadvanced version, the signature also enriches the input example's\nrepresentation. We also compare our finetuned architecture to few-shot GPT-3,\ndemonstrating its effectiveness in essential use cases.

Methods of improving LLM training stability\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Oleg Rybakov, Mike Chrzanowski, Peter Dykas, Jinze Xue, Ben Lanir*\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability of large language models(LLMs) is an important research\ntopic. Reproducing training instabilities can be costly, so we use a small\nlanguage model with 830M parameters and experiment with higher learning rates\nto force models to diverge. One of the sources of training instability is the\ngrowth of logits in attention layers. We extend the focus of the previous work\nand look not only at the magnitude of the logits but at all outputs of linear\nlayers in the Transformer block. We observe that with a high learning rate the\nL2 norm of all linear layer outputs can grow with each training step and the\nmodel diverges. Specifically we observe that QKV, Proj and FC2 layers have the\nlargest growth of the output magnitude. This prompts us to explore several\noptions: 1) apply layer normalization not only after QK layers but also after\nProj and FC2 layers too; 2) apply layer normalization after the QKV layer (and\nremove pre normalization). 3) apply QK layer normalization together with\nsoftmax capping. We show that with the last two methods we can increase\nlearning rate by 1.5x (without model divergence) in comparison to an approach\nbased on QK layer normalization only. Also we observe significant perplexity\nimprovements for all three methods in comparison to the baseline model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T04:27:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Dynamic Multi-Reward Weighting for Multi-Style Controllable Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dongyeop Kang, Ryan Koo, Karin de Langis*\n\n**Abstract:** Textual style expresses a diverse set of information, including interpersonal dynamics (e.g., formality) and the author's emotions or attitudes (e.g., disgust). An open question is how language models can be explicitly controlled so that they weave together target styles when generating text: for example, to produce text that is both negative and non-toxic. One approach to such controlled generation is multi-objective reinforcement learning (RL), but how best to combine multiple objectives in a reward function is an open question. In this paper, we investigate various formulations of multi-style rewards, including calibrated outputs from discriminators and dynamic weighting by discriminator gradient magnitudes. We find that our proposed dynamic weighting outperforms static weighting approaches with respect to style control while maintaining linguistic quality, and we explore its effectiveness in 2- and 3-style control.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Conditional Generative Models for Simulation of EMG During Naturalistic Movements\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Weight Generation*\n\n*Dario Farina, Xiangyang Zhu, Xinjun Sheng, Samuel Deslauriers-Gauthier, Kostiantyn Maksymenko, Alexander Kenneth Clarke, Shihan Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerical models of electromyographic (EMG) signals have provided a huge contribution to our fundamental understanding of human neurophysiology and remain a central pillar of motor neuroscience and the development of human-machine interfaces. However, whilst modern biophysical simulations based on finite element methods are highly accurate, they are extremely computationally expensive and thus are generally limited to modelling static systems such as isometrically contracting limbs. As a solution to this problem, we propose a transfer learning approach, in which a conditional generative model is trained to mimic the output of an advanced numerical model. To this end, we present BioMime, a conditional generative neural network trained adversarially to generate motor unit activation potential waveforms under a wide variety of volume conductor parameters. We demonstrate the ability of such a model to predictively interpolate between a much smaller number of numerical model's outputs with a high accuracy. Consequently, the computational load is dramatically reduced, which allows the rapid simulation of EMG signals during truly dynamic and naturalistic movements.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. HyperNetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*David Ha, Andrew Dai, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**Abstract:** This work explores hypernetworks: an approach of using a one network, also\nknown as a hypernetwork, to generate the weights for another network.\nHypernetworks provide an abstraction that is similar to what is found in\nnature: the relationship between a genotype - the hypernetwork - and a\nphenotype - the main network. Though they are also reminiscent of HyperNEAT in\nevolution, our hypernetworks are trained end-to-end with backpropagation and\nthus are usually faster. The focus of this work is to make hypernetworks useful\nfor deep convolutional networks and long recurrent networks, where\nhypernetworks can be viewed as relaxed form of weight-sharing across layers.\nOur main result is that hypernetworks can generate non-shared weights for LSTM\nand achieve near state-of-the-art results on a variety of sequence modelling\ntasks including character-level language modelling, handwriting generation and\nneural machine translation, challenging the weight-sharing paradigm for\nrecurrent networks. Our results also show that hypernetworks applied to\nconvolutional networks still achieve respectable results for image recognition\ntasks compared to state-of-the-art baseline models while requiring fewer\nlearnable parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. Personalized Federated Learning using Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: HyperNetworks*\n\n*Gal Chechik, Ethan Fetaya, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian*\n\n**Abstract:** Personalized federated learning is tasked with training machine learning models for multiple clients, each with its own data distribution. The goal is to train personalized models in a collaborative way while accounting for data disparities across clients and reducing communication costs. We propose a novel approach to this problem using hypernetworks, termed pFedHN for personalized Federated HyperNetworks. In this approach, a central hypernetwork model is trained to generate a set of models, one model for each client. This architecture provides effective parameter sharing across clients, while maintaining the capacity to generate unique and diverse personal models. Furthermore, since hypernetwork parameters are never transmitted, this approach decouples the communication cost from the trainable model size. We test pFedHN empirically in several personalized federated learning challenges and find that it outperforms previous methods. Finally, since hypernetworks share information across clients we show that pFedHN can generalize better to new clients whose distributions differ from any client observed during training.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-08\n\n\n\n#### 5. The Stability-Efficiency Dilemma: Investigating Sequence Length Warmup for Training GPT Models\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have demonstrated great success in pre-training large-scale autoregressive language models on massive GPUs. To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively. Experiments replicating GPT-3 model (125M) show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 40x larger learning rate, and retains 99% of the zero-shot accuracy on 11 tasks using 10x less data and 17x less time compared to the original GPT-3 training recipe, while the baseline diverges under the same settings and only retain 95% of accuracy under lower learning rate.\n\n**Conference:** curriculum-learning-a-regularization-method-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. Improving Training Stability for Multitask Ranking Models in Recommender Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Training Stability*\n\n*Ed H. Chi, Lichan Hong, Xinyang Yi, Li Wei, Justin Gilmer, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Daryl Chang, Yoel Drori, Jiaxi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recommender systems play an important role in many content platforms. While most recommendation research is dedicated to designing better models to improve user experience, we found that research on stabilizing the training for such models is severely under-explored. As recommendation models become larger and more sophisticated, they are more susceptible to training instability issues, i.e., loss divergence, which can make the model unusable, waste significant resources and block model developments. In this paper, we share our findings and best practices we learned for improving the training stability of a real-world multitask ranking model for YouTube recommendations. We show some properties of the model that lead to unstable training and conjecture on the causes. Furthermore, based on our observations of training dynamics near the point of training instability, we hypothesize why existing solutions would fail, and propose a new algorithm to mitigate the limitations of existing solutions. Our experiments on YouTube production dataset show the proposed algorithm can significantly improve training stability while not compromising convergence, comparing with several commonly used baseline methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using HyperNetworks for dynamic weight generation, focusing on training stability and computational efficiency, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Dynamic Weight Generation\n\n- **HyperNetworks** can dynamically generate weights for the MLP layers in language models, enhancing their expressiveness and adaptability. This approach is similar to what is described in the context of **HyperMixer**, where HyperNetworks are used to form token mixing MLPs, achieving results comparable to Transformers but at a lower computational cost[3,.\n\n- In the context of **Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers**, shared HyperNetworks can generate adapter parameters for multiple tasks, demonstrating their adaptability and parameter efficiency. This can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive models where the context changes with each token prediction[3,.\n\n## Training Stability\n\n- To ensure training stability when using dynamically generated weights, techniques such as **Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP)** and normalization strategies like **RMSNorm** are crucial. These methods help maintain the magnitude of weights, preventing gradient issues and stabilizing the training process[3,.\n\n- The paper on **Methods of improving LLM training stability** discusses various techniques, including applying layer normalization after QK layers and using softmax capping, which can be applied to HyperNetwork-based models to enhance stability[3,.\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n- While HyperNetworks introduce additional computational steps, strategies like **low-rank approximations** or using **shared MLPs** can help mitigate this overhead. For example, the **HyperMixer** approach achieves efficiency by dynamically forming token mixing MLPs without significantly increasing computational costs[3,.\n\n- The concept of **hypernetworks** as used in **Latent Weight Diffusion (LWD)** for robotic tasks also highlights the efficiency of generating weights dynamically. LWD uses a diffusion denoising model within a latent space to learn the distribution of policies, allowing for smaller policy networks during inference and fewer diffusion model queries. This efficiency can be translated to language models by ensuring that the weight generation process does not overly complicate the model architecture.\n\n## Recent Advancements and Empirical Results\n\n- **Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta)** introduces self-morphable architectures that dynamically adapt their structure without retraining, using Implicit Neural Representations (INR) as hypernetworks. This approach ensures smooth performance across different configurations and can be a powerful enabler for developing flexible and scalable AI models. While not specifically focused on language models, the principles of dynamic adaptation and efficiency can be applied to improve autoregressive language models.\n\n- **TapeAgents**, a framework for agent development and optimization, includes features like debugging, fine-tuning, and prompt-tuning, which can be integrated with HyperNetwork-based models to optimize their performance and stability. This framework demonstrates how adaptive and efficient models can be optimized for various tasks, which is relevant for autoregressive language models.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- Further research should focus on the specific impact of HyperNetworks on training stability and computational efficiency in different language model architectures. This includes exploring more case studies and empirical results that demonstrate the benefits of HyperNetworks in language models.\n- Investigating how recent advancements in dynamic weight generation, such as those in **NeuMeta** and **LWD**, can be applied to autoregressive language models to enhance their adaptability, expressiveness, and efficiency.\n- Comparing the performance of HyperNetwork-based models with existing models like Transformers to highlight their unique contributions and potential improvements.\n",

However, traditional MLPs have fixed weights that do not adapt to the input context, limiting the model's expressiveness and ability to capture complex patterns in language data.\n\nThe **SwiGluMLP** GAU in the seed design uses static linear transformations followed by activation functions. While effective, this static nature may not fully capture the diverse and context-dependent patterns inherent in language tasks.\n\nTo address this limitation, we propose **DynamicHyperMLP**, which integrates **HyperNetworks** into the SwiGluMLP GAU to enable dynamic weight generation conditioned on the input data. This integration aims to enhance the model's expressiveness and adaptability without significantly increasing computational complexity, ultimately improving performance on language modeling and downstream tasks.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### HyperNetworks\n\n*Ha, D., Dai, A., & Le, Q.

However, with efficient design (e.g., low-rank approximations), this overhead can be minimized.\n- **Training Stability**: Dynamic weight generation can lead to training instability. Techniques like Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP) and normalization are necessary to stabilize training.\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Careful architectural design is required to integrate HyperNetworks without disrupting the overall model structure.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection SwiGluMLP```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nIntegrate a HyperNetwork into the SwiGluMLP GAU to enable dynamic generation of the MLP weights based on the input embeddings. The HyperNetwork will generate the weights for the Up Projection and Down Projection layers.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. HyperNetwork Design\n\n- **HyperNetwork for Up Projection (\\( \\text{HyperUp} \\))**:\n  - Input: Aggregated representation of \\( X \\).\n  - Output: Weights \\( W_{\\text{Up}} \\) for the Up Projection layer.\n\n- **HyperNetwork for Down Projection (\\( \\text{HyperDown} \\))**:\n  - Input: Aggregated representation of \\( X \\).\n  - Output: Weights \\( W_{\\text{Down}} \\) for the Down Projection layer.\n\n#### 2. Input Representation for HyperNetwork\n\n- Use a pooling mechanism (e.g., mean pooling) to aggregate \\( X \\) across the sequence length dimension:\n  \\[\n  \\bar{X} = \\frac{1}{L} \\sum_{i=1}^{L} X[:, i, :]\n  \\]\n- Alternatively, use a learnable token or attention mechanism to produce a context vector.\n\n#### 3. HyperNetwork Architecture\n\n- **Structure**: Use a small MLP with non-linear activation functions to generate the weights.\n- **Parameterization**:\n  - **Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP)**: Implement MIP to stabilize training by ensuring the output weights have a normalized magnitude.\n  - **Weight Generation**:\n    \\[\n    W_{\\text{Up}} = \\text{Normalize}(\\text{MLP}_{\\text{Up}}(\\bar{X}))\n    \\]\n    \\[\n    W_{\\text{Down}} = \\text{Normalize}(\\text{MLP}_{\\text{Down}}(\\bar{X}))\n    \\]\n  - **Normalization**: Apply techniques like weight normalization or LayerNorm to the generated weights.\n\n#### 4. Modified SwiGluMLP Computation\n\n- **Gate Projection**: Remain as a static linear projection.\n- **Up Projection**:\n  \\[\n  U = \\sigma(\\text{GateProj}(X)) \\odot (X W_{\\text{Up}})\n  \\]\n- **Down Projection**:\n  \\[\n  Y = U W_{\\text{Down}}\n  \\]\n  \n#### 5. Training Stability Techniques\n\n- **Normalization Layers**: Apply LayerNorm to the outputs of the HyperNetworks.\n- **Regularization**: Use dropout and weight decay to prevent overfitting.\n- **Initialization**: Carefully initialize the HyperNetwork parameters to ensure stable gradients.\n\n#### 6. Efficiency Considerations\n\n- **Low-Rank Approximations**: Design the HyperNetworks to output low-rank weight matrices to reduce computational overhead.\n- **Parameter Sharing**: Share HyperNetwork parameters across layers or time steps where appropriate.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified SwiGluMLP\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom model_discovery.model.utils.modules import GAUBase\n\nclass DynamicHyperMLP(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    DynamicHyperMLP: Integrating HyperNetworks into SwiGluMLP for dynamic weight generation.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict, \n                 device=None, dtype=None, intermediate_size=None, hypernet_hidden_size=None, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        \n        self.hidden_size = embed_dim\n        self.intermediate_size = intermediate_size if intermediate_size is not None else int(embed_dim * 2.5)\n        \n        # Gate Projection (Static)\n        self.gate_proj = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.intermediate_size, bias=False, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # HyperNetworks for Up and Down Projections\n        hypernet_hidden_size = hypernet_hidden_size or self.hidden_size // 2\n        \n        # HyperNetwork for Up Projection\n        self.hyper_up = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, hypernet_hidden_size, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.GELU(),\n            nn.Linear(hypernet_hidden_size, self.hidden_size * self.intermediate_size, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.Tanh()  # MIP to stabilize outputs\n        )\n        \n        # HyperNetwork for Down Projection\n        self.hyper_down = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, hypernet_hidden_size, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.GELU(),\n            nn.Linear(hypernet_hidden_size, self.intermediate_size * self.hidden_size, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.Tanh()  # MIP to stabilize outputs\n        )\n        \n        # Normalization layers for generated weights\n        self.up_weight_norm = nn.LayerNorm([self.hidden_size, self.intermediate_size], **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.down_weight_norm = nn.LayerNorm([self.intermediate_size, self.hidden_size], **self.factory_kwargs)\n        \n        # Activation function\n        self.act_fn = nn.GELU()\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # X shape: (B, L, D)\n        B, L, D = X.size()\n        \n        # Aggregate input embeddings\n        X_pooled = X.mean(dim=1)  # Shape: (B, D)\n        \n        # Generate weights dynamically\n        W_up = self.hyper_up(X_pooled)  # Shape: (B, D * intermediate_size)\n        W_down = self.hyper_down(X_pooled)  # Shape: (B, intermediate_size * D)\n        \n        # Reshape weights\n        W_up = W_up.view(B, D, self.intermediate_size)\n        W_down = W_down.view(B, self.intermediate_size, D)\n        \n        # Normalize weights\n        W_up = self.up_weight_norm(W_up)\n        W_down = self.down_weight_norm(W_down)\n        \n        # Static gate projection\n        G = self.gate_proj(X)  # Shape: (B, L, intermediate_size)\n        \n        # Activation\n        G = self.act_fn(G)\n        \n        # Dynamic Up Projection\n        # Perform batch-wise matrix multiplication\n        U = torch.einsum('bld,bdh->blh', X, W_up)  # Shape: (B, L, intermediate_size)\n        \n        # Element-wise multiplication with gate\n        U = G * U  # Shape: (B, L, intermediate_size)\n        \n        # Dynamic Down Projection\n        Y = torch.einsum('blh,bhd->bld', U, W_down)  # Shape: (B, L, D)\n        \n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Modify the SwiGluMLP Class**\n\n   -
