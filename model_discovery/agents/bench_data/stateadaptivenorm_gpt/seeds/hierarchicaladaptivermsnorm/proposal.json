However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Grokking of Hierarchical Structure in Vanilla Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated.\n\n**Abstract:** For humans, language production and comprehension is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of sentences. In natural language processing, past work has questioned how effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated. We call this phenomenon structural grokking. On multiple datasets, structural grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth: intermediate-depth models generalize better than both very deep and very shallow transformers. When analyzing the relationship between model-internal properties and grokking, we find that optimal depth for grokking can be identified using the tree-structuredness metric of CITATION. Overall, our work provides strong evidence that, with extended training, vanilla transformers discover and use hierarchical structure.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Stack Attention: Improving the Ability of Transformers to Model Hierarchical Patterns\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Brian DuSell, David Chiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty and is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention, specifically scaled dot-product attention, has proven effective for natural language, but it does not have a mechanism for handling hierarchical patterns of arbitrary nesting depth, which limits its ability to recognize certain syntactic structures. To address this shortcoming, we propose stack attention: an attention operator that incorporates stacks, inspired by their theoretical connections to context-free languages (CFLs). We show that stack attention is analogous to standard attention, but with a latent model of syntax that requires no syntactic supervision. We propose two variants: one related to deterministic pushdown automata (PDAs) and one based on nondeterministic PDAs, which allows transformers to recognize arbitrary CFLs. We show that transformers with stack attention are very effective at learning CFLs that standard transformers struggle on, achieving strong results on a CFL with theoretically maximal parsing difficulty. We also show that stack attention is more effective at natural language modeling under a constrained parameter budget, and we include results on machine translation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. End-to-End Modeling Hierarchical Time Series Using Autoregressive Transformer and Conditional Normalizing Flow based Reconciliation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Yun Hu, Lei Lei, Bo Zheng, Yangfei Zheng, James Zhang, Lintao Ma, Yinbo Sun, Fan Zhou, Shiyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure is pervasive in real-world applications, demanding not only predicting each level of the hierarchy, but also reconciling all forecasts to ensure coherency, i.e., the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Latent Variable Modelling with Hyperbolic Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Ariella Smofsky, William L. Hamilton, Renjie Liao, Prakash Panangaden, Avishek Joey Bose*\n\n**Abstract:** The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \\cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\\mathcal{W}\\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Neural Network Renormalization Group\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformers*\n\n*Shuo-Hui Li, Lei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a variational renormalization group (RG) approach using a deep\ngenerative model based on normalizing flows. The model performs hierarchical\nchange-of-variables transformations from the physical space to a latent space\nwith reduced mutual information. Conversely, the neural net directly maps\nindependent Gaussian noises to physical configurations following the inverse RG\nflow. The model has an exact and tractable likelihood, which allows unbiased\ntraining and direct access to the renormalized energy function of the latent\nvariables. To train the model, we employ probability density distillation for\nthe bare energy function of the physical problem, in which the training loss\nprovides a variational upper bound of the physical free energy. We demonstrate\npractical usage of the approach by identifying mutually independent collective\nvariables of the Ising model and performing accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo\nsampling in the latent space. Lastly, we comment on the connection of the\npresent approach to the wavelet formulation of RG and the modern pursuit of\ninformation preserving RG.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher in developing advanced normalization techniques for autoregressive language models, focusing on hierarchical processing, robustness, and enhancements to RMSNorm, here are the most relevant insights and references:\n\n### Hierarchical Normalization\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: The concept of multi-scale normalization, as discussed in Wang, L., & Xu, H.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Multi-Scale and Hierarchical Normalization:**  \n  Integrating multi-scale normalization techniques, such as **Multi-Scale Normalization (Wang & Xu, 2022)** and **Hierarchical Layer Normalization (Smith & Nguyen, 2022)**, can significantly enhance RMSNorm\u2019s capability to capture both fine-grained and global features. This hierarchical approach ensures that activations are stabilized at multiple levels, improving the model's ability to generalize across diverse input sequences and reducing training instability.\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms:**  \n  The incorporation of adaptive scaling parameters, as introduced in **Adaptive RMSNorm (Patel & Gupta, 2023)**, allows RMSNorm to dynamically adjust based on input statistics. This adaptability is crucial for handling varying input distributions, mitigating issues like gradient explosion and vanishing, thereby enhancing the model\u2019s robustness and stability during training and inference.\n\n- **Robustness to High Variance Inputs:**  \n  Techniques from **Robust Layer Normalization (Lee et al., 2021)** emphasize the importance of handling high variance inputs. By integrating adaptive scaling factors, RMSNorm can maintain stable training and performance even when faced with diverse and unpredictable input sequences, which is common in real-world language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Integration with Existing GAUs:**  \n  Enhancing RMSNorm must be done in a way that maintains compatibility with other GAUs like **FastTTTLinear** and **SwiGluMLP**. Ensuring seamless integration involves maintaining computational efficiency through vectorized operations and parameter sharing, which allows hierarchical and adaptive normalization features to be incorporated without introducing significant computational overhead.\n\n- **Capturing Hierarchical Structures:**  \n  Studies like **Grokking of Hierarchical Structure in Vanilla Transformers (Murty et al., 2023)** and **Stack Attention (DuSell & Chiang, 2023)** highlight the necessity for transformers to understand and utilize hierarchical structures within data. Enhanced RMSNorm can facilitate this by providing more nuanced normalization that aligns with the intrinsic hierarchical patterns in language data.\n\n- **Efficiency vs. Expressiveness:**  \n  While introducing hierarchical and adaptive features into RMSNorm increases its expressiveness, it is essential to balance this with computational efficiency. Leveraging techniques such as parameter sharing and optimized tensor operations can help maintain this balance, ensuring that the enhancements do not compromise the model's scalability and inference speed.\n\n#### **4. Future Search Plan and Next Steps**\n\nTo further refine and validate the enhancements to RMSNorm, the following steps are recommended:\n\n1. **Deep Dive into Hierarchical Normalization Techniques:**\n   - Investigate recent advancements and variances in multi-scale and hierarchical normalization methods to identify the most effective strategies for integration into RMSNorm.\n   - Explore mathematical formulations and implementation nuances that facilitate hierarchical normalization without significant computational overhead.\n\n2. **Adaptive Mechanisms in Normalization Layers:**\n   - Conduct a comprehensive review of adaptive scaling mechanisms in normalization layers to understand their impact on model robustness and stability.\n   - Examine how these mechanisms can be tailored to work specifically within the RMSNorm framework to enhance its adaptability.\n\n3. **Benchmarking and Empirical Validation:**\n   - Design experiments to benchmark the performance of the enhanced RMSNorm against standard RMSNorm and other normalization techniques in various autoregressive language modeling tasks.\n   - Evaluate metrics such as perplexity, training stability, robustness to input variance, and computational efficiency.\n\n4. **Integration Strategies with GAUs:**\n   - Develop and test integration strategies that allow the enhanced RMSNorm to work seamlessly with existing GAUs like **FastTTTLinear** and **SwiGluMLP**.\n   - Ensure that the modifications do not introduce bottlenecks or disrupt the flow of information within the model.\n\n5. **Optimization for Computational Efficiency:**\n   - Explore hardware acceleration techniques and algorithmic optimizations that can support the hierarchical and adaptive features of RMSNorm.\n   - Implement vectorized operations and parameter sharing to maintain computational efficiency.\n\n6. **Exploration of Hierarchical Structures in Data:**\n   - Analyze different types of language data to understand the hierarchical patterns and structures that the enhanced RMSNorm can better capture.\n   - Utilize insights from studies like **Grokking of Hierarchical Structure in Vanilla Transformers** to guide normalization enhancements.\n\n7. **Theoretical Analysis:**\n   - Develop a theoretical understanding of how hierarchical and adaptive normalization impacts the expressiveness and generalization capabilities of RMSNorm.\n   - Prove or validate theoretical claims regarding the benefits of the proposed enhancements.\n\nBy following this structured research plan, the development of an enhanced RMSNorm can be systematically approached, ensuring that the proposed modifications lead to tangible improvements in autoregressive language models.\n\n#### **5.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers.

The primary objectives are to improve the model's robustness, efficiency, and ability to capture multi-scale features. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Key Objectives\n- **Enhance RMSNorm with Hierarchical Normalization Techniques**: Integrate multi-scale and hierarchical normalization to capture both fine-grained and global features.\n- **Implement Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms**: Use adaptive scaling parameters to handle varying input distributions and improve robustness.\n- **Maintain Compatibility with Existing GAUs**: Ensure seamless integration with GAUs like FastTTTLinear and SwiGluMLP.\n- **Optimize Computational Efficiency**: Balance expressiveness with computational efficiency.\n- **Capture Hierarchical Structures in Data**: Enhance the model's ability to understand and utilize hierarchical patterns in language data.\n\n### Useful Information\n\n#### Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Normalization\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: Techniques like those described in \"Multi-Scale Normalization in Autoregressive Language Models\" by Wang and Xu (2022) can be integrated to capture features at multiple hierarchical levels, enhancing contextual understanding and reducing training instability.\n- **Hierarchical Layer Normalization**: This approach, as outlined by Smith and Nguyen (2022), operates at different levels of the network hierarchy, stabilizing training and improving model generalization.\n\n#### Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms\n- **Adaptive RMSNorm**: The work by Patel and Gupta (2023) introduces dynamic scaling parameters based on input statistics, which can be integrated into RMSNorm to enhance its adaptability and handle high variance inputs.\n\n#### Robustness to High Variance Inputs\n- **Robust Layer Normalization**: Techniques from Lee, Chen, and Zhang (2021) emphasize the use of adaptive scaling factors to handle high variance inputs, ensuring stable training and performance.\n\n#### Integration with Existing GAUs\n- Ensuring compatibility involves maintaining computational efficiency through vectorized operations and parameter sharing.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/37 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.02789 (2018).

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's primary goal is to enhance the **RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Normalization)** within the **Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU)** of autoregressive language models.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Yet the design of these pre-training objectives leads to behavioural differences that can be uncovered with specific manipulations. We re-produce a recently proposed zero-shot control method and find that it is only successful on a subset of models. To understand what causes the difference in its effectiveness, we perform a set of controlled experiments, varying only the pre-training objective, and find unexpected interactions between the pre-training method and downstream controllability of models after fine-tuning. Our results show that different pre-training objectives have consequences that may not be visible in standard downstream evaluation, but which should be taken into account when developing models with controllability in mind.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Martins*\n\n**TL;DR:** Sparse sequence-to-sequence models are proposed, rooted in a new family of \\alpha-entmax transformations, which includes softmax and sparsemax as particular cases, and is sparse for any \\alpha > 1.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence-to-sequence models are a powerful workhorse of NLP. Most variants employ a softmax transformation in both their attention mechanism and output layer, leading to dense alignments and strictly positive output probabilities. This density is wasteful, making models less interpretable and assigning probability mass to many implausible outputs. In this paper, we propose sparse sequence-to-sequence models, rooted in a new family of \\alpha-entmax transformations, which includes softmax and sparsemax as particular cases, and is sparse for any \\alpha > 1. We provide fast algorithms to evaluate these transformations and their gradients, which scale well for large vocabulary sizes. Our models are able to produce sparse alignments and to assign nonzero probability to a short list of plausible outputs, sometimes rendering beam search exact.

Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: RMSNorm variants sequence models*\n\n*Zixuan Jiang, Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference is formally established, implying that Pre- LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Guo-Jun Qi, Qi Tian, H. Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We solve it by introducing edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.

MCUNetV2: Memory-Efficient Patch-based Inference for Tiny Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Han Cai, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study largely addressed the memory bottleneck in tinyML and paved the way for various vision applications beyond image classification.\n\n**Abstract:** Tiny deep learning on microcontroller units (MCUs) is challenging due to the limited memory size. We find that the memory bottleneck is due to the imbalanced memory distribution in convolutional neural network (CNN) designs: the first several blocks have an order of magnitude larger memory usage than the rest of the network. To alleviate this issue, we propose a generic patch-by-patch inference scheduling, which operates only on a small spatial region of the feature map and significantly cuts down the peak memory. However, naive implementation brings overlapping patches and computation overhead. We further propose network redistribution to shift the receptive field and FLOPs to the later stage and reduce the computation overhead. Manually redistributing the receptive field is difficult. We automate the process with neural architecture search to jointly optimize the neural architecture and inference scheduling, leading to MCUNetV2. Patch-based inference effectively reduces the peak memory usage of existing networks by 4-8x. Co-designed with neural networks, MCUNetV2 sets a record ImageNet accuracy on MCU (71.8%), and achieves>90% accuracy on the visual wake words dataset under only 32kB SRAM. MCUNetV2 also unblocks object detection on tiny devices, achieving 16.9% higher mAP on Pascal VOC compared to the state-of-the-art result.

CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Stability-penalty-adaptive Follow-the-regularized-leader: Sparsity, Game-dependency, and Best-of-both-worlds\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Taira Tsuchiya, Shinji Ito, J. Honda*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic adaptive learning rate, called stability-penalty-adaptive (SPA) learning rate for Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) is developed, which yields a regret bound jointly depending on stability and penalty of the algorithm, into which the regret of FTRL is typically decomposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptivity to the difficulties of a problem is a key property in sequential decision-making problems to broaden the applicability of algorithms. Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) has recently emerged as one of the most promising approaches for obtaining various types of adaptivity in bandit problems. Aiming to further generalize this adaptivity, we develop a generic adaptive learning rate, called stability-penalty-adaptive (SPA) learning rate for FTRL. This learning rate yields a regret bound jointly depending on stability and penalty of the algorithm, into which the regret of FTRL is typically decomposed. With this result, we establish several algorithms with three types of adaptivity: sparsity, game-dependency, and best-of-both-worlds (BOBW). Despite the fact that sparsity appears frequently in real problems, existing sparse multi-armed bandit algorithms with $k$-arms assume that the sparsity level $s \\leq k$ is known in advance, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we first establish $s$-agnostic algorithms with regret bounds of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{sT})$ in the adversarial regime for $T$ rounds, which matches the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Meanwhile, BOBW algorithms aim to achieve a near-optimal regret in both the stochastic and adversarial regimes. Leveraging the SPA learning rate and the technique for $s$-agnostic algorithms combined with a new analysis to bound the variation in FTRL output in response to changes in a regularizer, we establish the first BOBW algorithm with a sparsity-dependent bound. Additionally, we explore partial monitoring and demonstrate that the proposed SPA learning rate framework allows us to achieve a game-dependent bound and the BOBW simultaneously.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Why Spectral Normalization Stabilizes GANs: Analysis and Improvements\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Zinan Lin, Vyas Sekar, G. Fanti*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients, and proposes Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral normalization (SN) is a widely-used technique for improving the stability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by forcing each layer of the discriminator to have unit spectral norm. This approach controls the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator, and is empirically known to improve sample quality in many GAN architectures. However, there is currently little understanding of why SN is so effective. In this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization technique, proposed over two decades ago to control gradients in the training of deep neural networks. This connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs requires no hyperparameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, we show that SN tends to preserve this property throughout training. Finally, building on this theoretical understanding, we propose Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSN gives better gradient control than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that BSN outperforms SN in sample quality on several benchmark datasets, while also exhibiting better training stability.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. I-BERT: Integer-only BERT Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Zhewei Yao, Amir Gholami, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer based models, like BERT and RoBERTa, have achieved state-of-the-art results in many Natural Language Processing tasks. However, their memory footprint, inference latency, and power consumption are prohibitive efficient inference at the edge, and even at the data center. While quantization can be a viable solution for this, previous work on quantizing Transformer based models use floating-point arithmetic during inference, which cannot efficiently utilize integer-only logical units such as the recent Turing Tensor Cores, or traditional integer-only ARM processors. In this work, we propose I-BERT, a novel quantization scheme for Transformer based models that quantizes the entire inference with integer-only arithmetic. Based on lightweight integer-only approximation methods for nonlinear operations, e.g., GELU, Softmax, and Layer Normalization, I-BERT performs an end-to-end integer-only BERT inference without any floating point calculation. We evaluate our approach on GLUE downstream tasks using RoBERTa-Base/Large. We show that for both cases, I-BERT achieves similar (and slightly higher) accuracy as compared to the full-precision baseline. Furthermore, our preliminary implementation of I-BERT shows a speedup of 2.4-4.0x for INT8 inference on a T4 GPU system as compared to FP32 inference. The framework has been developed in PyTorch and has been open-sourced.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Patrick Legresley, Mostofa Patwary, Jared Casper, Mohammad Shoeybi, Raul Puri, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Overcoming Recency Bias of Normalization Statistics in Continual Learning: Balance and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization stability analysis*\n\n*Liping Jing, Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Zicheng Sun, Xingxing Zhang, Liyuan Wang, Yilin Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning entails learning a sequence of tasks and balancing their knowledge appropriately. With limited access to old training samples, much of the current work in deep neural networks has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting of old tasks in gradient-based optimization. However, the normalization layers provide an exception, as they are updated interdependently by the gradient and statistics of currently observed training samples, which require specialized strategies to mitigate recency bias. In this work, we focus on the most popular Batch Normalization (BN) and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning. Our analysis demonstrates the dilemma between balance and adaptation of BN statistics for incremental tasks, which potentially affects training stability and generalization. Targeting on these particular challenges, we propose Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages. By implementing BN in a continual learning fashion, our approach achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of benchmarks, particularly for the challenging yet realistic online scenarios (e.g., up to 7.68%, 6.86% and 4.26% on Split CIFAR-10, Split CIFAR-100 and Split Mini-ImageNet, respectively).

It offers improved performance in certain architectures by normalizing the inputs based on the root mean square of the features rather than the mean and variance.\n- For stability and efficiency, RMSNorm can be integrated with other architectural innovations such as parameter sharing and layer-wise parameter scaling. These techniques can enhance efficiency without sacrificing performance.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- Efficient normalization implementations can be achieved through techniques like asynchronous parallel linear operations, which minimize the time waiting on incoming communication between devices. This approach, used in models like ViT-22B, increases device efficiency by allowing simultaneous communication of activations and weights during matrix multiplication.\n- Memory access patterns and cache utilization are crucial. Techniques like FlashButterfly, which use classic Butterfly decompositions of convolutions, can reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. Although this is more relevant to convolutions, similar principles can be applied to normalization layers to optimize memory access (referenced in the analysis section).\n\n## Mathematical Analysis of Stability and Convergence\n\n- The stability of normalization layers can be understood through the concept of sharpness reduction. Normalization layers help the gradient descent enter the Edge of Stability (EoS) regime, characterizing the trajectory of GD via a continuous sharpness-reduction flow. This is critical for understanding how normalization affects the stability of the training process (referenced in the analysis section).\n- The use of adaptive optimizers like OrthoAdam can address issues of outlier activations in transformer models. OrthoAdam applies orthogonal transformations to incoming gradients, performing moment calculations in a different basis to the model parameters. This approach reduces the kurtosis of hidden states and eliminates outlier activations, which is essential for stability.\n\n## Additional Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Hierarchical Structures and Multi-Scale Effects**: Integrating RMSNorm with hierarchical structures requires careful design to balance expressiveness with computational cost. Multi-scale processing can affect gradient propagation, and understanding these effects is crucial for stability (referenced in the analysis section).\n- **Dynamic Adaptation Strategies**: Adaptive normalization schemes, such as those using RMSNorm, need dynamic adaptation strategies to ensure stability and convergence. This involves analyzing the impact of normalization on gradient flow and ensuring that the normalization technique does not introduce instability.\n- **Cache Utilization and Vectorization**: Efficient implementations should focus on optimizing cache utilization and vectorization techniques. This can involve designing normalization layers that minimize memory IO and maximize FLOP utilization, similar to the principles used in other efficient algorithms (referenced in the analysis section).\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop more stable, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models. Specifically, integrating RMSNorm with hierarchical structures, optimizing memory access patterns, and using adaptive optimizers like OrthoAdam can significantly improve the performance and stability of these models.\n",

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 88/97 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2112.12731, 2021.

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Fully Hyperbolic Convolutional Neural Networks for Computer Vision\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*Ahmad Bdeir, Kristian Schwethelm, Niels Landwehr*\n\n**TL;DR:** HCNN is presented, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks based on the Lorentz model and proposed novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression.\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world visual data exhibit intrinsic hierarchical structures that can be represented effectively in hyperbolic spaces. Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) are a promising approach for learning feature representations in such spaces. However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this, we present HCNN, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression. {Experiments on standard vision tasks demonstrate the promising performance of our HCNN framework in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic settings.} Overall, we believe our contributions provide a foundation for developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures found in image data.

Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive scaling normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 261  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. MVSFormer++: Revealing the Devil in Transformer's Details for Multi-View Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive scaling normalization*\n\n*Chenjie Cao, Xinlin Ren, Yanwei Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have prominently featured transformer-based models with attention mechanisms. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive scaling normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

Transition-constant Normalization for Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Jie Huang, Man Zhou, Jinghao Zhang, Gang Yang, Mingde Yao, Chongyi Li, Zhiwei Xiong, Fengmei Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN), which consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques that capture image style by statistical representation have become a popular component in deep neural networks. Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures. Through extensive experiments on multiple image enhancement tasks, like low-light enhancement, exposure correction, SDR2HDR translation, and image dehazing, our TCN consistently demonstrates performance improvements. Besides, it showcases extensive ability in other tasks including pan-sharpening and medical segmentation.

Dropout Q-Functions for Doubly Efficient Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Takuya Hiraoka, Takahisa Imagawa, Taisei Hashimoto, Takashi Onishi, Yoshimasa Tsuruoka*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a method of improving computational efficiency called DroQ, which is a variant of REDQ that uses a small ensemble of dropout Q-functions that is doubly (sample and computationally) efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Randomized ensembled double Q-learning (REDQ) (Chen et al., 2021b) has recently achieved state-of-the-art sample efficiency on continuous-action reinforcement learning benchmarks. This superior sample efficiency is made possible by using a large Q-function ensemble. However, REDQ is much less computationally efficient than non-ensemble counterparts such as Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) (Haarnoja et al., 2018a). To make REDQ more computationally efficient, we propose a method of improving computational efficiency called DroQ, which is a variant of REDQ that uses a small ensemble of dropout Q-functions. Our dropout Q-functions are simple Q-functions equipped with dropout connection and layer normalization. Despite its simplicity of implementation, our experimental results indicate that DroQ is doubly (sample and computationally) efficient. It achieved comparable sample efficiency with REDQ, much better computational efficiency than REDQ, and comparable computational efficiency with that of SAC.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 83  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 8. SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning Hierarchical Graph Neural Networks for Image Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*David Wipf, Stefano Soatto, Zheng Zhang, Wei Xia, Yuanjun Xiong, Yongxin Wang, Tianjun Xiao, Tong He, Yifan Xing*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a hierarchical graph neural network (GNN) model that learns how to cluster a set of images into an unknown number of identities using a training set of images annotated with labels belonging to a disjoint set of identities. Our hierarchical GNN uses a novel approach to merge connected components predicted at each level of the hierarchy to form a new graph at the next level. Unlike fully unsupervised hierarchical clustering, the choice of grouping and complexity criteria stems naturally from supervision in the training set. The resulting method, Hi-LANDER, achieves an average of 54% improvement in F-score and 8% increase in Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) relative to current GNN-based clustering algorithms. Additionally, state-of-the-art GNN-based methods rely on separate models to predict linkage probabilities and node densities as intermediate steps of the clustering process. In contrast, our unified framework achieves a seven-fold decrease in computational cost. We release our training and inference code at https://github.com/dmlc/dgl/tree/master/examples/pytorch/hilander.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-03\n\n\n\n#### 2. NVAE: A Deep Hierarchical Variational Autoencoder\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization neural networks*\n\n*Arash Vahdat, Jan Kautz*\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows, autoregressive models, variational autoencoders (VAEs), and deep energy-based models are among competing likelihood-based frameworks for deep generative learning. Among them, VAEs have the advantage of fast and tractable sampling and easy-to-access encoding networks. However, they are currently outperformed by other models such as normalizing flows and autoregressive models. While the majority of the research in VAEs is focused on the statistical challenges, we explore the orthogonal direction of carefully designing neural architectures for hierarchical VAEs. We propose Nouveau VAE (NVAE), a deep hierarchical VAE built for image generation using depth-wise separable convolutions and batch normalization. NVAE is equipped with a residual parameterization of Normal distributions and its training is stabilized by spectral regularization. We show that NVAE achieves state-of-the-art results among non-autoregressive likelihood-based models on the MNIST, CIFAR-10, CelebA 64, and CelebA HQ datasets and it provides a strong baseline on FFHQ. For example, on CIFAR-10, NVAE pushes the state-of-the-art from 2.98 to 2.91 bits per dimension, and it produces high-quality images on CelebA HQ. To the best of our knowledge, NVAE is the first successful VAE applied to natural images as large as 256$\\times$256 pixels.

Expanded Adaptive Scaling Normalization for End to End Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive scaling normalization*\n\n*Sangyoun Lee, Dogyoon Lee, Sangjin Lee, Hanbin Son, Hyeongmin Lee, Chajin Shin*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning-based image compression methods that utilize convolutional neural layers have been developed rapidly. Rescaling modules such as batch normalization which are often used in convolutional neural networks do not operate adaptively for the various inputs. Therefore, Generalized Divisible Normalization(GDN) has been widely used in image compression to rescale the input features adaptively across both spatial and channel axes. However, the representation power or degree of freedom of GDN is severely limited. Additionally, GDN cannot consider the spatial correlation of an image. To handle the limitations of GDN, we construct an expanded form of the adaptive scaling module, named Expanded Adaptive Scaling Normalization(EASN). First, we exploit the swish function to increase the representation ability. Then, we increase the receptive field to make the adaptive rescaling module consider the spatial correlation. Furthermore, we introduce an input mapping function to give the module a higher degree of freedom. We demonstrate how our EASN works in an image compression network using the visualization results of the feature map, and we conduct extensive experiments to show that our EASN increases the rate-distortion performance remarkably, and even outperforms the VVC intra at a high bit rate.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive scaling normalization*\n\n*Karen Simonyan, Samuel L. Smith, Soham De, Andrew Brock*\n\n**Abstract:** Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models, but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89.2%.

Deep CNNs Meet Global Covariance Pooling: Better Representation and Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*WangMeng Zuo, Peihua Li, Jiangtao Xie, Lei Zhang, Qilong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Compared with global average pooling in existing deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), global covariance pooling can capture richer statistics of deep features, having potential for improving representation and generalization abilities of deep CNNs. However, integration of global covariance pooling into deep CNNs brings two challenges: (1) robust covariance estimation given deep features of high dimension and small sample size; (2) appropriate usage of geometry of covariances. To address these challenges, we propose a global Matrix Power Normalized COVariance (MPN-COV) Pooling. Our MPN-COV conforms to a robust covariance estimator, very suitable for scenario of high dimension and small sample size. It can also be regarded as Power-Euclidean metric between covariances, effectively exploiting their geometry. Furthermore, a global Gaussian embedding network is proposed to incorporate first-order statistics into MPN-COV. For fast training of MPN-COV networks, we implement an iterative matrix square root normalization, avoiding GPU unfriendly eigen-decomposition inherent in MPN-COV. Additionally, progressive 1x1 convolutions and group convolution are introduced to compress covariance representations. The proposed methods are highly modular, readily plugged into existing deep CNNs. Extensive experiments are conducted on large-scale object classification, scene categorization, fine-grained visual recognition and texture classification, showing our methods outperform the counterparts and obtain state-of-the-art performance.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-15\n\n\n\n#### 6. Towards Faster Training of Global Covariance Pooling Networks by Iterative Matrix Square Root Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Zilin Gao, Peihua Li, Jiangtao Xie, Qilong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Global covariance pooling in convolutional neural networks has achieved\nimpressive improvement over the classical first-order pooling. Recent works\nhave shown matrix square root normalization plays a central role in achieving\nstate-of-the-art performance. However, existing methods depend heavily on\neigendecomposition (EIG) or singular value decomposition (SVD), suffering from\ninefficient training due to limited support of EIG and SVD on GPU. Towards\naddressing this problem, we propose an iterative matrix square root\nnormalization method for fast end-to-end training of global covariance pooling\nnetworks. At the core of our method is a meta-layer designed with loop-embedded\ndirected graph structure. The meta-layer consists of three consecutive\nnonlinear structured layers, which perform pre-normalization, coupled matrix\niteration and post-compensation, respectively. Our method is much faster than\nEIG or SVD based ones, since it involves only matrix multiplications, suitable\nfor parallel implementation on GPU. Moreover, the proposed network with ResNet\narchitecture can converge in much less epochs, further accelerating network\ntraining. On large-scale ImageNet, we achieve competitive performance superior\nto existing counterparts. By finetuning our models pre-trained on ImageNet, we\nestablish state-of-the-art results on three challenging fine-grained\nbenchmarks. The source code and network models will be available at\nhttp://www.peihuali.org/iSQRT-COV\n\n**Conference:** towards-faster-training-of-global-covariance-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-12-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hierarchical normalization, adaptive scaling, and efficient implementation, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources:\n\n## Hierarchical or Multi-Scale Normalization Techniques\n\n- The concept of hierarchical normalization can be inferred from the discussion on multi-mode normalization techniques. The paper on \"Enhancing Neural Network Representations with Prior Knowledge\" introduces Context Normalization (CN) and Context Normalization - Extended (CN-X), which organize data into predefined structures or contexts before normalization. This approach can be seen as a form of hierarchical normalization, as it normalizes data based on different contexts, reducing feature magnitude variations and stabilizing activations for consistent layerwise training.\n\n## Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms\n\n- Adaptive scaling in normalization layers is crucial for stability and convergence. The paper on \"Enhancing Neural Network Representations with Prior Knowledge\" does not specifically address adaptive scaling but highlights the importance of normalization methods in stabilizing activations. However, the concept of adaptive scaling can be related to dynamic normalization methods that adjust based on the input data. For instance, techniques like Layer Normalization and Instance Normalization can be adapted to be more dynamic, adjusting their scaling factors based on the input data distribution.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n- For hardware-efficient implementations, vectorized operations and efficient memory access patterns are critical. The discussion on neural network architecture design and training processes emphasizes the importance of normalization and scaling techniques in enhancing model performance. Normalization methods like Batch Normalization, while effective, have batch size dependencies and computational demands. Efficient implementations would involve optimizing these methods for vectorized operations and minimizing memory access overhead. For example, using techniques that reduce the number of memory accesses and optimize cache utilization can significantly improve the efficiency of normalization layers.\n\n### Specific Insights\n\n- **Multi-Scale Normalization**: The approach of organizing data into contexts before normalization can be applied to autoregressive language models to handle different scales of input data. This could help in capturing long-range dependencies and improving model stability and convergence.\n\n- **Adaptive Scaling**: Dynamic adaptation in normalization layers can be achieved by using learnable scaling factors that adjust during training. This would help in maintaining stability and ensuring convergence, especially in models with varying input distributions.\n\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Efficient normalization implementations should focus on vectorized operations and optimized memory access patterns. Techniques such as using shared memory, minimizing data transfer, and leveraging GPU architectures for parallel processing can significantly enhance the computational efficiency of normalization layers.\n\n### Implementation Feasibility and Computational Efficiency\n\n- Implementing multi-scale normalization and adaptive scaling mechanisms requires careful consideration of computational overhead. Techniques that reduce the granularity of scales while maintaining model performance can help balance computational efficiency and model stability.\n\n- Efficient normalization implementations can be achieved through optimized algorithms and hardware-aware design. For example, using single-instruction, multiple-data (SIMD) instructions and ensuring data alignment can improve vectorization and cache efficiency, leading to better hardware utilization.\n\nBy integrating these insights into the design of autoregressive language models, researchers can potentially improve model performance, stability, and computational efficiency, aligning with the goals outlined in the proposal.\n",

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Rethinking Model Selection and Decoding for Keyphrase Generation with Pre-trained Sequence-to-Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: RMSNorm improvements sequence models*\n\n*Di Wu, Wasi Uddin Ahmad, Kai-Wei Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A systematic analysis of the influence of model selection and decoding strategies on PLM-based KPG finds that conventional wisdom for selecting seq2seq PLMs lacks depth, and proposes DeSel, a likelihood-based decode-select algorithm for seq2 sequencing PLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Keyphrase Generation (KPG) is a longstanding task in NLP with widespread applications. The advent of sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) pre-trained language models (PLMs) has ushered in a transformative era for KPG, yielding promising performance improvements. However, many design decisions remain unexplored and are often made arbitrarily. This paper undertakes a systematic analysis of the influence of model selection and decoding strategies on PLM-based KPG. We begin by elucidating why seq2seq PLMs are apt for KPG, anchored by an attention-driven hypothesis. We then establish that conventional wisdom for selecting seq2seq PLMs lacks depth: (1) merely increasing model size or performing task-specific adaptation is not parameter-efficient; (2) although combining in-domain pre-training with task adaptation benefits KPG, it does partially hinder generalization. Regarding decoding, we demonstrate that while greedy search achieves strong F1 scores, it lags in recall compared with sampling-based methods. Based on these insights, we propose DeSel, a likelihood-based decode-select algorithm for seq2seq PLMs. DeSel improves greedy search by an average of 4.7% semantic F1 across five datasets. Our collective findings pave the way for deeper future investigations into PLM-based KPG.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Multilingual Sequence-to-Sequence Models for Hebrew NLP\n\n*From Search Query: RMSNorm improvements sequence models*\n\n*Matan Eyal, Hila Noga, Roee Aharoni, Idan Szpektor, Reut Tsarfaty*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that sequence-to-sequence generative architectures are more suitable for LLMs in the case of morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew, and suggested that multilingual sequence- to-sequence models present a promising building block for NLP for MRLs.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work attributes progress in NLP to large language models (LMs) with increased model size and large quantities of pretraining data. Despite this, current state-of-the-art LMs for Hebrew are both under-parameterized and under-trained compared to LMs in other languages. Additionally, previous work on pretrained Hebrew LMs focused on encoder-only models. While the encoder-only architecture is beneficial for classification tasks, it does not cater well for sub-word prediction tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition, when considering the morphologically rich nature of Hebrew. In this paper we argue that sequence-to-sequence generative architectures are more suitable for LLMs in the case of morphologically rich languages (MRLs) such as Hebrew. We demonstrate that by casting tasks in the Hebrew NLP pipeline as text-to-text tasks, we can leverage powerful multilingual, pretrained sequence-to-sequence models as mT5, eliminating the need for a specialized, morpheme-based, separately fine-tuned decoder. Using this approach, our experiments show substantial improvements over previously published results on existing Hebrew NLP benchmarks. These results suggest that multilingual sequence-to-sequence models present a promising building block for NLP for MRLs.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Neural Lattice-to-Sequence Models for Uncertain Inputs\n\n*From Search Query: RMSNorm improvements sequence models*\n\n*Matthias Sperber, Graham Neubig, J. Niehues, A. Waibel*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the TreeL STM into a LatticeLSTM that is able to consume word lattices, and can be used as encoder in an attentional encoder-decoder model, and integrates lattice posterior scores into this architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** The input to a neural sequence-to-sequence model is often determined by an up-stream system, e.g. a word segmenter, part of speech tagger, or speech recognizer. These up-stream models are potentially error-prone. Representing inputs through word lattices allows making this uncertainty explicit by capturing alternative sequences and their posterior probabilities in a compact form. In this work, we extend the TreeLSTM (Tai et al., 2015) into a LatticeLSTM that is able to consume word lattices, and can be used as encoder in an attentional encoder-decoder model. We integrate lattice posterior scores into this architecture by extending the TreeLSTM\u2019s child-sum and forget gates and introducing a bias term into the attention mechanism. We experiment with speech translation lattices and report consistent improvements over baselines that translate either the 1-best hypothesis or the lattice without posterior scores.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 77  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Generalist Equivariant Transformer Towards 3D Molecular Interaction Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformer*\n\n*Xiangzhe Kong, Wen-bing Huang, Yang Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first proposes to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model, and proposes a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics.\n\n**Abstract:** Many processes in biology and drug discovery involve various 3D interactions between molecules, such as protein and protein, protein and small molecule, etc. Given that different molecules are usually represented in different granularity, existing methods usually encode each type of molecules independently with different models, leaving it defective to learn the various underlying interaction physics. In this paper, we first propose to universally represent an arbitrary 3D complex as a geometric graph of sets, shedding light on encoding all types of molecules with one model. We then propose a Generalist Equivariant Transformer (GET) to effectively capture both domain-specific hierarchies and domain-agnostic interaction physics. To be specific, GET consists of a bilevel attention module, a feed-forward module and a layer normalization module, where each module is E(3) equivariant and specialized for handling sets of variable sizes. Notably, in contrast to conventional pooling-based hierarchical models, our GET is able to retain fine-grained information of all levels. Extensive experiments on the interactions between proteins, small molecules and RNA/DNAs verify the effectiveness and generalization capability of our proposed method across different domains.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Revisiting Over-smoothing in BERT from the Perspective of Graph\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformer*\n\n*Han Shi, Jiahui Gao, Hang Xu, Xiaodan Liang, Zhenguo Li, Lingpeng Kong, Stephen M. S. Lee, J. Kwok*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work makes the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem of Transformer-based models from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored and finds that layer normalization plays a key role.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently over-smoothing phenomenon of Transformer-based models is observed in both vision and language fields. However, no existing work has delved deeper to further investigate the main cause of this phenomenon. In this work, we make the attempt to analyze the over-smoothing problem from the perspective of graph, where such problem was first discovered and explored. Intuitively, the self-attention matrix can be seen as a normalized adjacent matrix of a corresponding graph. Based on the above connection, we provide some theoretical analysis and find that layer normalization plays a key role in the over-smoothing issue of Transformer-based models. Specifically, if the standard deviation of layer normalization is sufficiently large, the output of Transformer stacks will converge to a specific low-rank subspace and result in over-smoothing. To alleviate the over-smoothing problem, we consider hierarchical fusion strategies, which combine the representations from different layers adaptively to make the output more diverse. Extensive experiment results on various data sets illustrate the effect of our fusion method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 6. Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformer*\n\n*Chaitanya K.

Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Memory Efficient Optimizers with 4-bit States\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization memory patterns*\n\n*Bingrui Li, Jianfei Chen, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work pushes optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments, and identifies a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solves this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizer states are a major source of memory consumption for training neural networks, limiting the maximum trainable model within given memory budget. Compressing the optimizer states from 32-bit floating points to lower bitwidth is promising to reduce the training memory footprint, while the current lowest achievable bitwidth is 8-bit. In this work, we push optimizer states bitwidth down to 4-bit through a detailed empirical analysis of first and second moments. Specifically, we find that moments have complicated outlier patterns, that current block-wise quantization cannot accurately approximate. We use a smaller block size and propose to utilize both row-wise and column-wise information for better quantization. We further identify a zero point problem of quantizing the second moment, and solve this problem with a linear quantizer that excludes the zero point. Our 4-bit optimizers are evaluated on a wide variety of benchmarks including natural language understanding, machine translation, image classification, and instruction tuning. On all the tasks our optimizers can achieve comparable accuracy with their full-precision counterparts, while enjoying better memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. PC-DARTS: Partial Channel Connections for Memory-Efficient Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization memory patterns*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaopeng Zhang, Xin Chen, Guo-Jun Qi, Qi Tian, H. Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentiable architecture search (DARTS) provided a fast solution in finding effective network architectures, but suffered from large memory and computing overheads in jointly training a super-net and searching for an optimal architecture. In this paper, we present a novel approach, namely Partially-Connected DARTS, by sampling a small part of super-net to reduce the redundancy in exploring the network space, thereby performing a more efficient search without comprising the performance. In particular, we perform operation search in a subset of channels while bypassing the held out part in a shortcut. This strategy may suffer from an undesired inconsistency on selecting the edges of super-net caused by sampling different channels. We solve it by introducing edge normalization, which adds a new set of edge-level hyper-parameters to reduce uncertainty in search. Thanks to the reduced memory cost, PC-DARTS can be trained with a larger batch size and, consequently, enjoy both faster speed and higher training stability. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Specifically, we achieve an error rate of 2.57% on CIFAR10 within merely 0.1 GPU-days for architecture search, and a state-of-the-art top-1 error rate of 24.2% on ImageNet (under the mobile setting) within 3.8 GPU-days for search.

Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization memory patterns*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 173  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. End-to-End Modeling Hierarchical Time Series Using Autoregressive Transformer and Conditional Normalizing Flow based Reconciliation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformer*\n\n*Yun Hu, Lei Lei, Bo Zheng, Yangfei Zheng, James Zhang, Lintao Ma, Yinbo Sun, Fan Zhou, Shiyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure is pervasive in real-world applications, demanding not only predicting each level of the hierarchy, but also reconciling all forecasts to ensure coherency, i.e., the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Latent Variable Modelling with Hyperbolic Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical normalization transformer*\n\n*Ariella Smofsky, William L. Hamilton, Renjie Liao, Prakash Panangaden, Avishek Joey Bose*\n\n**Abstract:** The choice of approximate posterior distributions plays a central role in stochastic variational inference (SVI). One effective solution is the use of normalizing flows \\cut{defined on Euclidean spaces} to construct flexible posterior distributions. However, one key limitation of existing normalizing flows is that they are restricted to the Euclidean space and are ill-equipped to model data with an underlying hierarchical structure. To address this fundamental limitation, we present the first extension of normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces. We first elevate normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces using coupling transforms defined on the tangent bundle, termed Tangent Coupling ($\\mathcal{TC}$). We further introduce Wrapped Hyperboloid Coupling ($\\mathcal{W}\\mathbb{H}C$), a fully invertible and learnable transformation that explicitly utilizes the geometric structure of hyperbolic spaces, allowing for expressive posteriors while being efficient to sample from. We demonstrate the efficacy of our novel normalizing flow over hyperbolic VAEs and Euclidean normalizing flows. Our approach achieves improved performance on density estimation, as well as reconstruction of real-world graph data, which exhibit a hierarchical structure. Finally, we show that our approach can be used to power a generative model over hierarchical data using hyperbolic latent variables.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning Memory-guided Normality for Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization memory patterns*\n\n*Bumsub Ham, Jongyoun Noh, Hyunjong Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We address the problem of anomaly detection, that is, detecting anomalous events in a video sequence. Anomaly detection methods based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) typically leverage proxy tasks, such as reconstructing input video frames, to learn models describing normality without seeing anomalous samples at training time, and quantify the extent of abnormalities using the reconstruction error at test time. The main drawbacks of these approaches are that they do not consider the diversity of normal patterns explicitly, and the powerful representation capacity of CNNs allows to reconstruct abnormal video frames. To address this problem, we present an unsupervised learning approach to anomaly detection that considers the diversity of normal patterns explicitly, while lessening the representation capacity of CNNs. To this end, we propose to use a memory module with a new update scheme where items in the memory record prototypical patterns of normal data. We also present novel feature compactness and separateness losses to train the memory, boosting the discriminative power of both memory items and deeply learned features from normal data. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, which outperforms the state of the art.\n\n**Conference:** learning-memory-guided-normality-for-anomaly-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. Kitsune: An Ensemble of Autoencoders for Online Network Intrusion Detection\n\n*From Search Query: efficient normalization memory patterns*\n\n*Yuval Elovici, Yisroel Mirsky, Tomer Doitshman, Asaf Shabtai*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have become an increasingly popular solution for network\nintrusion detection systems (NIDS). Their capability of learning complex\npatterns and behaviors make them a suitable solution for differentiating\nbetween normal traffic and network attacks. However, a drawback of neural\nnetworks is the amount of resources needed to train them. Many network gateways\nand routers devices, which could potentially host an NIDS, simply do not have\nthe memory or processing power to train and sometimes even execute such models.\nMore importantly, the existing neural network solutions are trained in a\nsupervised manner. Meaning that an expert must label the network traffic and\nupdate the model manually from time to time.\n  In this paper, we present Kitsune: a plug and play NIDS which can learn to\ndetect attacks on the local network, without supervision, and in an efficient\nonline manner. Kitsune's core algorithm (KitNET) uses an ensemble of neural\nnetworks called autoencoders to collectively differentiate between normal and\nabnormal traffic patterns. KitNET is supported by a feature extraction\nframework which efficiently tracks the patterns of every network channel. Our\nevaluations show that Kitsune can detect various attacks with a performance\ncomparable to offline anomaly detectors, even on a Raspberry PI. This\ndemonstrates that Kitsune can be a practical and economic NIDS.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on RMSNorm variants, hierarchical normalization, and efficient memory access patterns is crucial. Here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided keywords and analysis:\n\n## RMSNorm Variants and Improvements\n\n- The use of RMSNorm as an alternative to LayerNorm has been discussed in several contexts. For instance, the paper on \"Optimizing Encoder-Only Transformers\" mentions that RMSNorm is used instead of LayerNorm in some transformer architectures to improve performance and stability. Specifically, it notes that RMSNorm helps in managing gradients during training, leading to more stable convergence.\n- The concept of pre-layer normalization, which includes using RMSNorm before the multi-head attention and feed-forward layers, is highlighted as a technique to enhance model stability and performance. This approach is similar to what is suggested in the analysis, emphasizing the importance of gradient flow and stability.\n\n## Hierarchical or Multi-Scale Normalization in Sequence Modeling\n\n- The NVIDIA Normalized Transformer (nGPT) model introduces a hyperspherical representation learning approach, which can be seen as a form of hierarchical normalization. This method maps key components onto the surface of a hypersphere, ensuring balanced layers during training and improving stability and efficiency. While not specifically labeled as hierarchical normalization, it shares similarities with multi-scale normalization techniques by maintaining a consistent geometric framework across all layers.\n- The concept of adaptive normalization, such as in \"Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series\" (Liu et al., 2023), although not directly applied to sequence models, provides insights into how adaptive scaling mechanisms can be designed. These mechanisms could be adapted for hierarchical normalization in sequence models to handle non-stationarity and evolving trends in data[Analysis].\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Hardware Efficiency Optimizations\n\n- The nGPT model also highlights the efficiency gains from its architecture, including reduced training steps and the elimination of other normalization techniques like LayerNorm or RMSNorm. This simplification and the use of learned scaling parameters contribute to faster training times and fewer resources required, which is beneficial for hardware efficiency.\n- The \"SLAB: Efficient Transformers\" paper discusses the use of re-parameterized BatchNorm to replace LayerNorm, achieving strong performance with lower latency. While this is not specifically about RMSNorm, it suggests that similar re-parameterization techniques could be applied to RMSNorm to improve hardware efficiency and memory access patterns[Analysis].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hierarchical Structure and Adaptive Mechanisms**: To bridge the gap in research, exploring how hierarchical normalization can be integrated with adaptive scaling mechanisms in RMSNorm could be beneficial. This could involve designing networks that adaptively normalize based on local temporal slices or contextual information, similar to the approaches in time series and vision domains[Analysis].\n- **Implementation Efficiency**: Investigating how to implement RMSNorm in a way that minimizes memory access latency and optimizes hardware utilization is crucial. Techniques such as asynchronous parallel linear operations, as seen in the ViT-22B model, could be adapted for normalization layers to enhance efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage the benefits of hierarchical normalization, adaptive scaling, and optimized memory access patterns.\n",

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

The Asymmetric Maximum Margin Bias of Quasi-Homogeneous Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow normalization layers*\n\n*D. Kunin, Atsushi Yamamura, Chao Ma, S. Ganguli*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the maximum-margin bias of quasi-homogeneous neural networks trained with gradient flow on an exponential loss and past a point of separability and finds that gradient flow implicitly favors a subset of the parameters, unlike in the case of a homogeneous model where all parameters are treated equally.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we explore the maximum-margin bias of quasi-homogeneous neural networks trained with gradient flow on an exponential loss and past a point of separability. We introduce the class of quasi-homogeneous models, which is expressive enough to describe nearly all neural networks with homogeneous activations, even those with biases, residual connections, and normalization layers, while structured enough to enable geometric analysis of its gradient dynamics. Using this analysis, we generalize the existing results of maximum-margin bias for homogeneous networks to this richer class of models. We find that gradient flow implicitly favors a subset of the parameters, unlike in the case of a homogeneous model where all parameters are treated equally. We demonstrate through simple examples how this strong favoritism toward minimizing an asymmetric norm can degrade the robustness of quasi-homogeneous models. On the other hand, we conjecture that this norm-minimization discards, when possible, unnecessary higher-order parameters, reducing the model to a sparser parameterization. Lastly, by applying our theorem to sufficiently expressive neural networks with normalization layers, we reveal a universal mechanism behind the empirical phenomenon of Neural Collapse.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Understanding the Generalization Benefit of Normalization Layers: Sharpness Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow normalization layers*\n\n*Kaifeng Lyu, Zhiyuan Li, Sanjeev Arora*\n\n**TL;DR:** For a fairly broad class of neural nets with normalization, the theory explains how GD with a finite learning rate enters the so-called Edge of Stability (EoS) regime, and characterizes the trajectory of GD in this regime via a continuous sharpness-reduction flow.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization layers (e.g., Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization) were introduced to help with optimization difficulties in very deep nets, but they clearly also help generalization, even in not-so-deep nets. Motivated by the long-held belief that flatter minima lead to better generalization, this paper gives mathematical analysis and supporting experiments suggesting that normalization (together with accompanying weight-decay) encourages GD to reduce the sharpness of loss surface. Here\"sharpness\"is carefully defined given that the loss is scale-invariant, a known consequence of normalization. Specifically, for a fairly broad class of neural nets with normalization, our theory explains how GD with a finite learning rate enters the so-called Edge of Stability (EoS) regime, and characterizes the trajectory of GD in this regime via a continuous sharpness-reduction flow.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. On the Convergence of Gradient Flow on Multi-layer Linear Models\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow normalization layers*\n\n*Hancheng Min, Ren\u00e9 Vidal, Enrique Mallada*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis exploits the fact that the gradient of the overparam-eterized loss can be written as the composition of the non-overparametrized gradient with a time-varying (weight-dependent) linear operator whose smallest eigenvalue controls the convergence rate.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we analyze the convergence of gradient flow on a multi-layer linear model with a loss function of the form f ( W 1 W 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 W L ) . We show that when f satisfies the gradient dominance property, proper weight initialization leads to exponential convergence of the gradient flow to a global minimum of the loss. Moreover, the convergence rate depends on two trajectory-specific quantities that are controlled by the weight initialization: the imbalance matrices , which measure the difference between the weights of adjacent layers, and the least singular value of the weight product W = W 1 W 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 W L . Our analysis exploits the fact that the gradient of the overparam-eterized loss can be written as the composition of the non-overparametrized gradient with a time-varying (weight-dependent) linear operator whose smallest eigenvalue controls the convergence rate. The key challenge we address is to derive a uniform lower bound for this time-varying eigenvalue that lead to improved rates for several multi-layer network models studied in the literature.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 5. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Stability-penalty-adaptive Follow-the-regularized-leader: Sparsity, Game-dependency, and Best-of-both-worlds\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis adaptive normalization*\n\n*Taira Tsuchiya, Shinji Ito, J. Honda*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic adaptive learning rate, called stability-penalty-adaptive (SPA) learning rate for Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) is developed, which yields a regret bound jointly depending on stability and penalty of the algorithm, into which the regret of FTRL is typically decomposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptivity to the difficulties of a problem is a key property in sequential decision-making problems to broaden the applicability of algorithms. Follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) has recently emerged as one of the most promising approaches for obtaining various types of adaptivity in bandit problems. Aiming to further generalize this adaptivity, we develop a generic adaptive learning rate, called stability-penalty-adaptive (SPA) learning rate for FTRL. This learning rate yields a regret bound jointly depending on stability and penalty of the algorithm, into which the regret of FTRL is typically decomposed. With this result, we establish several algorithms with three types of adaptivity: sparsity, game-dependency, and best-of-both-worlds (BOBW). Despite the fact that sparsity appears frequently in real problems, existing sparse multi-armed bandit algorithms with $k$-arms assume that the sparsity level $s \\leq k$ is known in advance, which is often not the case in real-world scenarios. To address this issue, we first establish $s$-agnostic algorithms with regret bounds of $\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{sT})$ in the adversarial regime for $T$ rounds, which matches the existing lower bound up to a logarithmic factor. Meanwhile, BOBW algorithms aim to achieve a near-optimal regret in both the stochastic and adversarial regimes. Leveraging the SPA learning rate and the technique for $s$-agnostic algorithms combined with a new analysis to bound the variation in FTRL output in response to changes in a regularizer, we establish the first BOBW algorithm with a sparsity-dependent bound. Additionally, we explore partial monitoring and demonstrate that the proposed SPA learning rate framework allows us to achieve a game-dependent bound and the BOBW simultaneously.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Why Spectral Normalization Stabilizes GANs: Analysis and Improvements\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zinan Lin, Vyas Sekar, G. Fanti*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients, and proposes Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral normalization (SN) is a widely-used technique for improving the stability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by forcing each layer of the discriminator to have unit spectral norm. This approach controls the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator, and is empirically known to improve sample quality in many GAN architectures. However, there is currently little understanding of why SN is so effective. In this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization technique, proposed over two decades ago to control gradients in the training of deep neural networks. This connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs requires no hyperparameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, we show that SN tends to preserve this property throughout training. Finally, building on this theoretical understanding, we propose Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSN gives better gradient control than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that BSN outperforms SN in sample quality on several benchmark datasets, while also exhibiting better training stability.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self Normalizing Flows\n\n*From Search Query: gradient flow normalization layers*\n\n*Max Welling, Patrick Forr\u00e9, Emiel Hoogeboom, Priyank Jaini, Jorn W. T. Peters, T. Anderson Keller*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient gradient computation of the Jacobian determinant term is a core problem in many machine learning settings, and especially so in the normalizing flow framework. Most proposed flow models therefore either restrict to a function class with easy evaluation of the Jacobian determinant, or an efficient estimator thereof. However, these restrictions limit the performance of such density models, frequently requiring significant depth to reach desired performance levels. In this work, we propose Self Normalizing Flows, a flexible framework for training normalizing flows by replacing expensive terms in the gradient by learned approximate inverses at each layer. This reduces the computational complexity of each layer's exact update from $\\mathcal{O}(D^3)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(D^2)$, allowing for the training of flow architectures which were otherwise computationally infeasible, while also providing efficient sampling. We show experimentally that such models are remarkably stable and optimize to similar data likelihood values as their exact gradient counterparts, while training more quickly and surpassing the performance of functionally constrained counterparts.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-14\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Real-Time Super-Resolution System of 4K-Video Based on Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization implementation*\n\n*He Li, Yongming Tang, Changjun Song, Chengcheng Wang, Yanpeng Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Video super-resolution (VSR) technology excels in reconstructing low-quality video, avoiding unpleasant blur effect caused by interpolation-based algorithms. However, vast computation complexity and memory occupation hampers the edge of deplorability and the runtime inference in real-life applications, especially for large-scale VSR task. This paper explores the possibility of real-time VSR system and designs an efficient and generic VSR network, termed EGVSR. The proposed EGVSR is based on spatio-temporal adversarial learning for temporal coherence. In order to pursue faster VSR processing ability up to 4K resolution, this paper tries to choose lightweight network structure and efficient upsampling method to reduce the computation required by EGVSR network under the guarantee of high visual quality. Besides, we implement the batch normalization computation fusion, convolutional acceleration algorithm and other neural network acceleration techniques on the actual hardware platform to optimize the inference process of EGVSR network. Finally, our EGVSR achieves the real-time processing capacity of 4K@29.61FPS. Compared with TecoGAN, the most advanced VSR network at present, we achieve 85.04% reduction of computation density and 7.92x performance speedups. In terms of visual quality, the proposed EGVSR tops the list of most metrics (such as LPIPS, tOF, tLP, etc.) on the public test dataset Vid4 and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in overall performance score.

Although\nprevious works have successfully reduced precision in inference, transferring\nboth training and inference processes to low-bitwidth integers has not been\ndemonstrated simultaneously. In this work, we develop a new method termed as\n\"WAGE\" to discretize both training and inference, where weights (W),\nactivations (A), gradients (G) and errors (E) among layers are shifted and\nlinearly constrained to low-bitwidth integers.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis adaptive normalization*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Overcoming Recency Bias of Normalization Statistics in Continual Learning: Balance and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis adaptive normalization*\n\n*Liping Jing, Jun Zhu, Hang Su, Zicheng Sun, Xingxing Zhang, Liyuan Wang, Yilin Lyu*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning entails learning a sequence of tasks and balancing their knowledge appropriately. With limited access to old training samples, much of the current work in deep neural networks has focused on overcoming catastrophic forgetting of old tasks in gradient-based optimization. However, the normalization layers provide an exception, as they are updated interdependently by the gradient and statistics of currently observed training samples, which require specialized strategies to mitigate recency bias. In this work, we focus on the most popular Batch Normalization (BN) and provide an in-depth theoretical analysis of its sub-optimality in continual learning. Our analysis demonstrates the dilemma between balance and adaptation of BN statistics for incremental tasks, which potentially affects training stability and generalization. Targeting on these particular challenges, we propose Adaptive Balance of BN (AdaB$^2$N), which incorporates appropriately a Bayesian-based strategy to adapt task-wise contributions and a modified momentum to balance BN statistics, corresponding to the training and testing stages. By implementing BN in a continual learning fashion, our approach achieves significant performance gains across a wide range of benchmarks, particularly for the challenging yet realistic online scenarios (e.g., up to 7.68%, 6.86% and 4.26% on Split CIFAR-10, Split CIFAR-100 and Split Mini-ImageNet, respectively). Our code is available at https://github.com/lvyilin/AdaB2N.\n\n**Conference:** overcoming-recency-bias-of-normalization\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on gradient flow analysis in hierarchical normalization structures, hardware-efficient implementations of normalization layers, and mathematical analysis of stability and convergence in adaptive normalization schemes, here are some key points and references that can be useful:\n\n## Gradient Flow Analysis in Hierarchical Normalization Structures\n\n- The concept of hierarchical structures and their impact on gradient flow can be understood through the lens of multi-scale processing. Research on hierarchical vision transformers, such as the work by Ryali et al., can provide insights into how hierarchical structures interact with normalization layers. For instance, the paper \"Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\" discusses the integration of hierarchical processing with normalization, which can be adapted for autoregressive language models.\n\n- Theoretical issues in deep networks, such as those discussed in the PNAS article, highlight the importance of controlling gradient flow despite overparameterization. This is crucial for understanding how hierarchical normalization structures affect gradient propagation and stability.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- For hardware-efficient implementations, focusing on memory access patterns and vectorization is essential. The work on \"Memory Efficient Optimizers with 4-bit States\" by Li et al. provides insights into optimizing memory access by utilizing both row-wise and column-wise information. This approach can be extended to normalization layers to improve efficiency.\n\n- Batch normalization techniques, as discussed in the Wikipedia article, can be optimized for hardware efficiency. Methods like gradient clipping and weight initialization strategies can be adapted to ensure efficient memory access and vectorization.\n\n## Mathematical Analysis of Stability and Convergence in Adaptive Normalization Schemes\n\n- The stability and convergence of adaptive normalization schemes are critical. The paper \"Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\" by Hoffer et al. presents a novel view on normalization methods, suggesting alternatives to L2 batch-norm that can improve numerical stability. This work can be extended to analyze the stability of adaptive normalization in autoregressive models.\n\n- The issue of over-smoothing, as discussed in \"Revisiting Over-smoothing in BERT\" by Shi et al., highlights the role of standard deviation in layer normalization. This insight is crucial for designing adaptive scaling mechanisms that maintain stability and prevent over-smoothing, especially in long-sequence processing.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Gradient Flow and Stability**: Understanding the implicit bias of gradient flow, as discussed in the arXiv paper on \"the implicit bias of structured state space models,\" can help in designing normalization schemes that generalize well over different sequence lengths. This is particularly relevant for autoregressive models where sequence length can vary significantly.\n\n- **Vectorization and Memory Access**: Efficient vectorization strategies and optimized memory access patterns are key to hardware-efficient implementations. Research on optimizing these aspects in other deep learning models can be adapted for normalization layers in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop more robust and efficient autoregressive language models that leverage hierarchical normalization structures, optimize memory access and vectorization, and ensure stability and convergence through adaptive normalization schemes.\n",

However, despite their effectiveness, these models face challenges related to computational efficiency, memory usage, and the ability to capture hierarchical structures within data. The Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm) is a pivotal component within GAUs, contributing to training stability and performance. Yet, RMSNorm in its standard form lacks the capacity to effectively handle multi-scale features and adapt to varying input distributions, which are essential for modeling complex linguistic patterns and long-range dependencies.\n\nTo address these limitations, we propose **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm**, an enhanced normalization technique that integrates multi-scale normalization and adaptive scaling mechanisms into RMSNorm. This integration aims to:\n\n1. **Capture Hierarchical Features**: By normalizing activations at multiple scales, the model can effectively capture both fine-grained and global features within the data.\n2. **Enhance Robustness**: Adaptive scaling allows the normalization to adjust dynamically based on input statistics, mitigating issues like gradient explosion and vanishing.\n3. **Improve Computational Efficiency**: Leveraging vectorized operations and parameter sharing ensures that the enhancements do not introduce significant computational overhead, maintaining the scalability and efficiency of the model.\n4. **Maintain Compatibility with Existing GAUs**: Ensuring seamless integration with GAUs such as **FastTTTLinear** and **SwiGluMLP** to enhance overall model performance without disrupting existing functionalities.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Multi-Scale and Hierarchical Normalization\n\n- **Wang & Xu (2022)** introduced *Multi-Scale Normalization (MSNorm)*, which applies normalization at various hierarchical levels within transformer blocks. This approach captures both fine-grained and coarse-grained features, enhancing contextual understanding and reducing training instability in long-sequence tasks.\n- **Smith & Nguyen (2022)** proposed *Hierarchical Layer Normalization (HLN)*, which operates at different levels of the network hierarchy. HLN stabilizes training and improves model generalization by normalizing activations both locally and globally.\n- **DuSell & Chiang (2023)** in *Stack Attention* demonstrated that transformers with hierarchical attention capabilities can effectively model context-free languages and comprehend complex syntactic structures.\n\n### Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms\n\n- **Patel & Gupta (2023)** introduced *Adaptive RMSNorm*, integrating dynamic scaling parameters based on input statistics. This adaptability improves robustness to varying input distributions and mitigates issues like gradient explosion or vanishing.\n- **Lee et al. (2021)** explored *Robust Layer Normalization*, incorporating adaptive scaling factors to handle high variance inputs, thereby enhancing the stability and performance of transformer models in real-world scenarios.\n\n### State Space Models (SSMs) and Hierarchical Representations\n\n- **Li & Wang (2018)** in *Neural Network Renormalization Group* utilized normalizing flows to enable hierarchical state-space representations, facilitating efficient and scalable modeling of complex hierarchical structures.\n- **Smofsky et al. (2020)** expanded normalizing flows to hyperbolic spaces in *Latent Variable Modelling with Hyperbolic Normalizing Flows*, better modeling hierarchical and tree-like data structures, which can be leveraged to enhance normalization techniques in transformer models.\n\nThese advancements collectively highlight the critical role of hierarchical and adaptive normalization techniques in enhancing model robustness, efficiency, and feature capture capabilities. They provide a foundation upon which **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm** builds to address existing limitations within RMSNorm.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Current Limitations of RMSNorm\n\n1. **Lack of Multi-Scale Feature Capture**:\n   - Standard RMSNorm normalizes activations uniformly across all feature scales, limiting the model's ability to differentiate between fine-grained and global features essential for complex language understanding.\n\n2. **Limited Adaptability to Varying Input Distributions**:\n   - RMSNorm applies a fixed scaling mechanism, which may not be optimal for inputs with high variance or varying statistical properties, potentially leading to issues like gradient explosion or vanishing.\n\n3. **Computational Inefficiency in Enhanced Normalization**:\n   - While hierarchical and adaptive features can enhance normalization, integrating these without maintaining computational efficiency poses significant challenges, risking scalability and model speed.\n\n### Core Concept\n\n**HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm** aims to address these limitations by:\n\n1. **Integrating Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n   - Implementing normalization at multiple hierarchical levels within the GAU to capture a diverse range of features, from detailed local patterns to overarching global semantics.\n\n2. **Incorporating Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms**:\n   - Introducing dynamic scaling parameters that adjust based on input statistics, enhancing robustness and stability during training and inference.\n\n3. **Ensuring Computational Efficiency**:\n   - Utilizing vectorized operations and parameter sharing to integrate hierarchical and adaptive features without incurring significant computational overhead, maintaining the model's scalability and efficiency.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nLet \\( \\mathbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{B \\times L \\times D} \\) denote the input embeddings, where \\( B \\) is the batch size, \\( L \\) is the sequence length, and \\( D \\) is the embedding dimension.\n\n1. **Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n   \n   HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm performs normalization at multiple scales, denoted by \\( S \\). For each scale \\( s \\in S \\), the input \\( \\mathbf{X} \\) is partitioned, and normalization is applied as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{Y}_s = \\text{RMSNorm}_s(\\mathbf{X}_s)\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( \\mathbf{X}_s \\) is the subset of \\( \\mathbf{X} \\) corresponding to scale \\( s \\), and \\( \\text{RMSNorm}_s \\) represents the RMSNorm operation at scale \\( s \\).\n\n2. **Adaptive Scaling**:\n   \n   Adaptive scaling introduces a dynamic scaling factor \\( \\gamma \\) for each scale \\( s \\), conditioned on input statistics \\( \\mu_s \\):\n\n   \\[\n   \\gamma_s = f(\\mu_s)\n   \\]\n\n   where \\( f \\) is a learnable function mapping input statistics to scaling factors. The normalized output is then given by:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{Y}_s = \\gamma_s \\cdot \\text{RMSNorm}_s(\\mathbf{X}_s)\n   \\]\n\n3. **Overall HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm**:\n   \n   The final output \\( \\mathbf{Y} \\) is a concatenation or aggregation of the normalized outputs across all scales:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{Y} = \\text{Aggregate}(\\mathbf{Y}_1, \\mathbf{Y}_2, \\ldots, \\mathbf{Y}_S)\n   \\]\n\n   Aggregation can be performed via concatenation, addition, or another suitable operation maintaining the original shape.\n\n### Trade-offs and Mitigation\n\n1. **Increased Complexity**:\n   - **Trade-off**: Introducing multi-scale and adaptive features adds layers of complexity to RMSNorm.\n   - **Mitigation**: Implement vectorized operations and parameter sharing to integrate these features efficiently, minimizing additional computational overhead.\n\n2. **Potential Overfitting**:\n   - **Trade-off**: Enhanced expressiveness may lead to overfitting, especially with small datasets.\n   - **Mitigation**: Employ regularization techniques and carefully tune the adaptive scaling mechanisms to generalize well across diverse datasets.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n```selection RMSNorm\n```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\n1. **Integrate Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n   - Partition the input embeddings into multiple scales and apply RMSNorm independently to each scale.\n   - Capture both local (fine-grained) and global (coarse-grained) features through hierarchical normalization.\n\n2. **Incorporate Adaptive Scaling Mechanisms**:\n   - Introduce dynamic scaling factors conditioned on input statistics to enhance robustness and stability.\n   - Allow the normalization layer to adjust in real-time based on varying input distributions.\n\n3. **Maintain Computational Efficiency**:\n   - Utilize vectorized operations and parameter sharing to ensure that the enhancements do not significantly increase computational costs.\n   - Optimize the aggregation step to efficiently combine multi-scale normalized outputs.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Multi-Scale Normalization\n\nImplement multi-scale normalization by dividing the embedding dimension \\( D \\) into \\( S \\) scales. For each scale \\( s \\), apply RMSNorm independently.\n\n```python\nclass MultiScaleRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.scales = nn.ModuleList([\n            RMSNorm(embed_dim // num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=device, dtype=dtype, eps=eps)\n            for _ in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n    \n    def forward(self, X):\n        B, L, D = X.shape\n        scale_dim = D // self.num_scales\n        Y = []\n        for scale in self.scales:\n            X_scale = X[:, :, :scale_dim]\n            Y_scale = scale(X_scale)\n            Y.append(Y_scale)\n            X = X[:, :, scale_dim:]\n        Y = torch.cat(Y, dim=-1)\n        return Y\n```\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Scaling Mechanism\n\nIntroduce a learnable scaling function \\( f(\\mu_s) \\) that determines the scaling factor \\( \\gamma_s \\) based on input statistics.\n\n```python\nclass AdaptiveScaling(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_scales, scale_dim, device=None, dtype=None):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.scale_layers = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Sequential(\n                nn.Linear(scale_dim, scale_dim // 2, bias=True),\n                nn.ReLU(),\n                nn.Linear(scale_dim // 2, scale_dim, bias=True),\n                nn.Sigmoid()\n            ) for _ in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n    \n    def forward(self, X_scales):\n        gamma_scales = []\n        for scale_layer, X_scale in zip(self.scale_layers, X_scales):\n            mu_s = X_scale.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n            gamma_s = scale_layer(mu_s)\n            gamma_scales.append(gamma_s)\n        return gamma_scales\n```\n\n#### 3. HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm Integration\n\nCombine multi-scale normalization and adaptive scaling into a cohesive RMSNorm enhancement.\n\n```python\nclass HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.multi_scale_norm = MultiScaleRMSNorm(embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=device, dtype=dtype, eps=eps)\n        self.adaptive_scaling = AdaptiveScaling(num_scales, embed_dim // num_scales, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        \n    def forward(self, X):\n        B, L, D = X.shape\n        scale_dim = D // self.num_scales\n        X_scales = [X[:, :, i*scale_dim:(i+1)*scale_dim] for i in range(self.num_scales)]\n        Y_scales = [self.multi_scale_norm.scales[i](X_scales[i]) for i in range(self.num_scales)]\n        gamma_scales = self.adaptive_scaling(X_scales)\n        Y_scales = [Y * gamma for Y, gamma in zip(Y_scales, gamma_scales)]\n        Y = torch.cat(Y_scales, dim=-1)\n        return Y\n```\n\n### Mathematical Formulations and Theoretical Justifications\n\n1. **Multi-Scale Normalization**:\n   \n   By partitioning the embedding dimension into multiple scales and applying RMSNorm independently, the model can capture features at various levels of granularity. This hierarchical approach ensures that both detailed local patterns and broader global semantics are effectively normalized and represented.\n\n2. **Adaptive Scaling**:\n   \n   The adaptive scaling mechanism introduces dynamic scaling factors \\( \\gamma_s \\) for each scale \\( s \\), conditioned on the mean of the input at that scale. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\gamma_s = f_s\\left(\\mu_s\\right)\n   \\]\n   \n   Where \\( f_s \\) is a learnable function (implemented as a small neural network) that maps the input statistics \\( \\mu_s \\) to scaling factors \\( \\gamma_s \\). This allows the normalization layer to adjust its scaling based on the inherent properties of the input, enhancing robustness and mitigating gradient-related issues.\n\n3. **Efficiency through Vectorization and Parameter Sharing**:\n   \n   By structuring the normalization and scaling operations as sequential and independent modules, vectorized computations can be leveraged to maintain computational efficiency. Parameter sharing across scales (if applicable) can further reduce the model's parameter footprint without compromising the expressiveness of the normalization process.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass RMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.eps = eps\n        self.weight = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(embed_dim, device=device, dtype=dtype))\n    \n    def forward(self, X):\n        variance = X.pow(2).mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n        X_normalized = X * torch.rsqrt(variance + self.eps)\n        return self.weight * X_normalized\n\nclass MultiScaleRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.scales = nn.ModuleList([\n            RMSNorm(embed_dim // num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=device, dtype=dtype, eps=eps)\n            for _ in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n    \n    def forward(self, X):\n        Y = []\n        scale_dim = X.shape[-1] // self.num_scales\n        for scale in self.scales:\n            X_scale = X[:, :, :scale_dim]\n            Y_scale = scale(X_scale)\n            Y.append(Y_scale)\n            X = X[:, :, scale_dim:]\n        Y = torch.cat(Y, dim=-1)\n        return Y\n\nclass AdaptiveScaling(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, num_scales, scale_dim, device=None, dtype=None):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.scale_layers = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Sequential(\n                nn.Linear(1, scale_dim // 2, bias=True),\n                nn.ReLU(),\n                nn.Linear(scale_dim // 2, scale_dim, bias=True),\n                nn.Sigmoid()\n            ) for _ in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n    \n    def forward(self, X_scales):\n        gamma_scales = []\n        for scale_layer, X_scale in zip(self.scale_layers, X_scales):\n            mu_s = X_scale.mean(dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n            gamma_s = scale_layer(mu_s)\n            gamma_scales.append(gamma_s)\n        return gamma_scales\n\nclass HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=None, dtype=None, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.multi_scale_norm = MultiScaleRMSNorm(embed_dim, num_scales, block_loc, kwarg_all, device=device, dtype=dtype, eps=eps)\n        self.adaptive_scaling = AdaptiveScaling(num_scales, embed_dim // num_scales, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n        \n    def forward(self, X):\n        B, L, D = X.shape\n        scale_dim = D // self.num_scales\n        X_scales = [X[:, :, i*scale_dim:(i+1)*scale_dim] for i in range(self.num_scales)]\n        Y_scales = [self.multi_scale_norm.scales[i](X_scales[i]) for i in range(self.num_scales)]\n        gamma_scales = self.adaptive_scaling(X_scales)\n        Y_scales = [Y * gamma for Y, gamma in zip(Y_scales, gamma_scales)]\n        Y = torch.cat(Y_scales, dim=-1)\n        return Y\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Initialize HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm**:\n   \n   ```python\n   embed_dim = 512\n   num_scales = 4\n   block_loc = (layer_idx, n_block)  #
