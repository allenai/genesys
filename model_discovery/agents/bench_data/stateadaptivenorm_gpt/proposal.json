Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/37 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.96)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.92)\n\n*Wenbing Li, Hang Zhou, Junqing Yu, Zikai Song, Wei Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Coupled SSM model is proposed, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes, and demonstrates that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities. However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\\%, 0.9\\%, and 2.3\\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\\% faster inference and 83.7\\% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/22 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2006.09199, 2020.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Abdul Fatir Ansari, Alvin Heng, Andre Lim, Harold Soh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations and proposes three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Parallel and Efficient Hierarchical k-Median Clustering\n\n*From Search Query: parallel hierarchical processing*\n\n*Vincent Cohen-Addad, Silvio Lattanzi, A. Norouzi-Fard, C. Sohler, O. Svensson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a fundamental unsupervised learning task, hierarchical clustering has been extensively studied in the past decade. In particular, standard metric formulations as hierarchical k -center, k -means, and k -median received a lot of attention and the problems have been studied extensively in different models of computation. Despite all this interest, not many ef\ufb01cient parallel algorithms are known for these problems. In this paper we introduce a new parallel algorithm for the Euclidean hierarchical k -median problem that, when using machines with memory s (for s \u2208 \u2126(log 2 ( n + \u2206 + d )) ), outputs a hierarchical clustering such that for every \ufb01xed value of k the cost of the solution is at most an O (min { d, log n } log \u2206) factor larger in expectation than that of an optimal solution. Furthermore, we also get that in for all k simultanuously the cost of the solution is at most an expected O (min { d, log n } log \u2206 log(\u2206 dn )) factor bigger that the corresponding optimal solution. The algorithm requires in O (log s ( nd log( n + \u2206))) rounds. Here d is the dimension of the data set and \u2206 is the ratio between the maximum and minimum distance of two points in the input dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the \ufb01rst parallel algorithm for the hierarchical k -median problem with theoretical guarantees.

Sanguinetti, Luis Oala*\n\n**TL;DR:** DiffInfinite is presented, a hierarchical diffusion model that generates arbitrarily large histological images while preserving long-range correlation structural information and can be parallelized more efficiently than previous large-content generation methods while avoiding tiling artifacts.\n\n**Abstract:** We present DiffInfinite, a hierarchical diffusion model that generates arbitrarily large histological images while preserving long-range correlation structural information. Our approach first generates synthetic segmentation masks, subsequently used as conditions for the high-fidelity generative diffusion process. The proposed sampling method can be scaled up to any desired image size while only requiring small patches for fast training. Moreover, it can be parallelized more efficiently than previous large-content generation methods while avoiding tiling artifacts. The training leverages classifier-free guidance to augment a small, sparsely annotated dataset with unlabelled data. Our method alleviates unique challenges in histopathological imaging practice: large-scale information, costly manual annotation, and protective data handling. The biological plausibility of DiffInfinite data is evaluated in a survey by ten experienced pathologists as well as a downstream classification and segmentation task. Samples from the model score strongly on anti-copying metrics which is relevant for the protection of patient data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation*\n\n*Yanzhe Zhang, Xuezhi Wang, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules with pseudo experience replay can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

Birdie: Advancing State Space Models with Reward-Driven Objectives and\n  Curricula\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Sam Blouir, Jimmy T. H. Smith, Antonios Anastasopoulos, Amarda Shehu*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient state space models (SSMs), such as linear recurrent neural networks\nand linear attention variants, offer computational advantages over Transformers\nbut struggle with tasks requiring long-range in-context retrieval-like text\ncopying, associative recall, and question answering over long contexts.\nPrevious efforts to address these challenges have focused on architectural\nmodifications, often reintroducing computational inefficiencies. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel training procedure, Birdie, that significantly enhances the\nin-context retrieval capabilities of SSMs without altering their architecture.\nOur approach combines bidirectional input processing with dynamic mixtures of\nspecialized pre-training objectives, optimized via reinforcement learning. We\nintroduce a new bidirectional SSM architecture that seamlessly transitions from\nbidirectional context processing to causal generation. Experimental evaluations\ndemonstrate that Birdie markedly improves performance on retrieval-intensive\ntasks such as multi-number phone book lookup, long paragraph\nquestion-answering, and infilling. This narrows the performance gap with\nTransformers, while retaining computational efficiency. Our findings highlight\nthe importance of training procedures in leveraging the fixed-state capacity of\nSSMs, offering a new direction to advance their capabilities.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Scalable and Flexible Clustering of Grouped Data via Parallel and Distributed Sampling in Versatile Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes\n\n*From Search Query: parallel hierarchical processing*\n\n*Freifeld Oren, Dinari Or*\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive clustering of grouped data is often\r\ndone via the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model (HDPMM). That approach, however, is limited in its flexibility and usually does\r\nnot scale well. As a remedy, we propose another, but closely related, hierarchical Bayesian\r\nnonparametric framework. Our main contributions are as follows. 1) a new model, called the\r\nVersatile HDPMM (vHDPMM), with two possible settings: full and reduced. While the latter\r\nis akin to the HDPMM\u2019s setting, the former\r\nsupports not only global features (as HDPMM\r\ndoes) but also local ones. 2) An effective mechanism for detecting global features. 3) A new\r\nsampler that addresses the challenges posed\r\nby the vHDPMM and, in the reduced setting,\r\nscales better than HDPMM samplers. 4) An\r\nefficient, distributed, and easily-modifiable implementation that offers more flexibility (even\r\nin the reduced setting) than publicly-available\r\nHDPMM implementations. Finally, we show\r\nthe utility of the approach in applications such\r\nas image cosegmentation, visual topic modeling, and clustering with missing data.\n\n**Proceeding:** uncertainty-in-artificial-intelligence-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-04\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Nagel, Michael Bussmann, Benjamin Worpitz, Guido Juckeland, Axel Huebl*\n\n**Abstract:** Porting applications to new hardware or programming models is a tedious and\nerror prone process. Every help that eases these burdens is saving developer\ntime that can then be invested into the advancement of the application itself\ninstead of preserving the status-quo on a new platform.\n  The Alpaka library defines and implements an abstract hierarchical redundant\nparallelism model. The model exploits parallelism and memory hierarchies on a\nnode at all levels available in current hardware. By doing so, it allows to\nachieve platform and performance portability across various types of\naccelerators by ignoring specific unsupported levels and utilizing only the\nones supported on a specific accelerator. All hardware types (multi- and\nmany-core CPUs, GPUs and other accelerators) are supported for and can be\nprogrammed in the same way. The Alpaka C++ template interface allows for\nstraightforward extension of the library to support other accelerators and\nspecialization of its internals for optimization.\n  Running Alpaka applications on a new (and supported) platform requires the\nchange of only one source code line instead of a lot of \\#ifdefs.\n\n**Published:** 2016-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. APG: Adaptive Parameter Generation Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation*\n\n*Hongbo Deng, Bo Zheng, Jian Xu, Feng Li, Kai Zhang, Pengjie Wang, Bencheng Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** In many web applications, deep learning-based CTR prediction models (deep CTR models for short) are widely adopted. Traditional deep CTR models learn patterns in a static manner, i.e., the network parameters are the same across all the instances. However, such a manner can hardly characterize each of the instances which may have different underlying distributions. It actually limits the representation power of deep CTR models, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an efficient, effective, and universal module, named as Adaptive Parameter Generation network (APG), which can dynamically generate parameters for deep CTR models on-the-fly based on different instances. Extensive experimental evaluation results show that APG can be applied to a variety of deep CTR models and significantly improve their performance. Meanwhile, APG can reduce the time cost by 38.7\\% and memory usage by 96.6\\% compared to a regular deep CTR model. We have deployed APG in the industrial sponsored search system and achieved 3\\% CTR gain and 1\\% RPM gain respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 6. PEA-Diffusion: Parameter-Efficient Adapter with Knowledge Distillation in non-English Text-to-Image Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter generation*\n\n*Haonan Lu, Qingsong Xie, Chen Chen, Jian Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Text-to-image diffusion models are well-known for their ability to generate realistic images based on textual prompts. However, the existing works have predominantly focused on English, lacking support for non-English text-to-image models. The most commonly used translation methods cannot solve the generation problem related to language culture, while training from scratch on a specific language dataset is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we are inspired to propose a simple plug-and-play language transfer method based on knowledge distillation. All we need to do is train a lightweight MLP-like parameter-efficient adapter (PEA) with only 6M parameters under teacher knowledge distillation along with a small parallel data corpus. We are surprised to find that freezing the parameters of UNet can still achieve remarkable performance on the language-specific prompt evaluation set, demonstrating that PEA can stimulate the potential generation ability of the original UNet. Additionally, it closely approaches the performance of the English text-to-image model on a general prompt evaluation set. Furthermore, our adapter can be used as a plugin to achieve significant results in downstream tasks in cross-lingual text-to-image generation.

Here are some relevant points:\n\n- **Mamba and Hi-Mamba**: These models utilize SSMs to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. Hi-Mamba, for example, uses a Hierarchical Mamba Block (HMB) that combines Local SSM (L-SSM) and Region SSM (R-SSM) to aggregate multi-scale representations, which can be beneficial for hierarchical processing in language models.\n\n- **State Space Duality**: The concept of State Space Duality (SSD) introduced in SC-MAMBA2 simplifies the matrix A into a scalar, allowing for more efficient and scalable modeling. This could be adapted to reduce computational overhead in language models.\n\n## Parallel Hierarchical Processing\n\nTo enhance efficiency and scalability, parallel processing of hierarchical structures is crucial:\n\n- **Hierarchical Mamba Block (HMB)**: Hi-Mamba's HMB design allows for parallel processing by allocating isomeric single-direction scanning into cascading HMBs. This approach can be adapted to language models to process different scales of information in parallel, enhancing context modeling ability.\n\n- **Multi-scale Processing**: Combining both bottom-up and top-down information flow, as suggested in hierarchical processing, can be effective in integrating features at multiple scales. This can be applied to language models to improve the integration of contextual information at different levels (Analysis Note).\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Generation\n\nDynamic parameter generation based on input context can significantly improve model adaptability:\n\n- **Dynamic Parameters**: The AdaptiveNorm-GPT model features dynamic parameter generation based on input context. Integrating this with SSMs could enhance the adaptability of the model while managing computational overhead. Careful design is necessary to balance adaptability and efficiency (Analysis Note).\n\n- **Efficient Implementation**: Ensuring that dynamic parameter generation does not incur significant computational overhead is crucial. Techniques such as those discussed in the context of optimizers (e.g., Shampoo, Adagrad) that store preconditioners at varying levels of granularity could be explored to optimize this process.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Directions\n\n### Combining Techniques\n- **TTT Architecture Integration**: Integrating the efficient state processing of SSMs with the adaptive normalization mechanisms of HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm, and leveraging the TTT architecture, could provide a robust and efficient framework for autoregressive language models (Analysis Note).\n\n### Managing Computational Overhead\n- **Optimized Parameter Generation**: Methods to reduce the overhead of dynamic parameter generation, such as using sparse preconditioners or optimizing memory usage, are essential. Techniques from pruning and sparse neural networks could be adapted to manage this overhead.\n\n### Bidirectional Information Flow\n- **Bidirectional Scanning**: Implementing bidirectional information flow between scales, similar to the Bi-directional Mamba Encoder used in whole slide image analysis, can enhance the capture of both local and global contextual information in language models.\n\n### Stability and Efficiency\n- **Stability with Hierarchical Structures**: Ensuring stability with complex hierarchical structures is critical. This can be achieved by carefully designing the integration of multiple adaptive mechanisms and optimizing memory usage to avoid computational bottlenecks (Analysis Note).\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages efficient state space models, parallel hierarchical processing, and adaptive parameter generation, thereby improving efficiency, scalability, and overall performance.\n",

An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33: $1474-1487,2020 \\mathrm{a}$.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

How to Train Your HiPPO: State Space Models with Generalized Orthogonal Basis Projections (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Albert Gu, Isys Johnson, Aman Timalsina, A.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Neologisms refer to recent expressions that are specific to certain entities or events and are being increasingly used by the public, but have not yet been accepted in mainstream language. Automated methods for handling neologisms are important for natural language understanding and normalization, especially for informal genres with user generated content. We present an unsupervised approach for detecting neologisms and then normalizing them to canonical words without relying on parallel training data. Our approach builds on the text normalization literature and introduces adaptations to fit the specificities of this task, including phonetic and etymological considerations.

Parallel Sampling of Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: parallel normalization techniques*\n\n*Andy Shih, Suneel Belkhale, Stefano Ermon, Dorsa Sadigh, Nima Anari*\n\n**TL;DR:** ParaDiGMS is the first diffusion sampling method that enables trading compute for speed and is even compatible with existing fast sampling techniques such as DDIM and DPMSolver.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models are powerful generative models but suffer from slow sampling, often taking 1000 sequential denoising steps for one sample. As a result, considerable efforts have been directed toward reducing the number of denoising steps, but these methods hurt sample quality. Instead of reducing the number of denoising steps (trading quality for speed), in this paper we explore an orthogonal approach: can we run the denoising steps in parallel (trading compute for speed)? In spite of the sequential nature of the denoising steps, we show that surprisingly it is possible to parallelize sampling via Picard iterations, by guessing the solution of future denoising steps and iteratively refining until convergence. With this insight, we present ParaDiGMS, a novel method to accelerate the sampling of pretrained diffusion models by denoising multiple steps in parallel. ParaDiGMS is the first diffusion sampling method that enables trading compute for speed and is even compatible with existing fast sampling techniques such as DDIM and DPMSolver. Using ParaDiGMS, we improve sampling speed by 2-4x across a range of robotics and image generation models, giving state-of-the-art sampling speeds of 0.2s on 100-step DiffusionPolicy and 14.6s on 1000-step StableDiffusion-v2 with no measurable degradation of task reward, FID score, or CLIP score.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state space models*\n\n*Boqing Gong, Matthew Brown, Mingxing Tan, Li Zhang, Yandong Li, Liangzhe Yuan, Dan Kondratyuk*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Mobile Video Networks (MoViNets), a family of computation and memory efficient video networks that can operate on streaming video for online inference. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are accurate at video recognition but require large computation and memory budgets and do not support online inference, making them difficult to work on mobile devices. We propose a three-step approach to improve computational efficiency while substantially reducing the peak memory usage of 3D CNNs. First, we design a video network search space and employ neural architecture search to generate efficient and diverse 3D CNN architectures. Second, we introduce the Stream Buffer technique that decouples memory from video clip duration, allowing 3D CNNs to embed arbitrary-length streaming video sequences for both training and inference with a small constant memory footprint. Third, we propose a simple ensembling technique to improve accuracy further without sacrificing efficiency. These three progressive techniques allow MoViNets to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on the Kinetics, Moments in Time, and Charades video action recognition datasets. For instance, MoViNet-A5-Stream achieves the same accuracy as X3D-XL on Kinetics 600 while requiring 80% fewer FLOPs and 65% less memory.

Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient state space models*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Megatron-LM: Training Multi-Billion Parameter Language Models Using Model Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: parallel normalization techniques*\n\n*Patrick Legresley, Mostofa Patwary, Jared Casper, Mohammad Shoeybi, Raul Puri, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work in language modeling demonstrates that training large transformer models advances the state of the art in Natural Language Processing applications. However, very large models can be quite difficult to train due to memory constraints. In this work, we present our techniques for training very large transformer models and implement a simple, efficient intra-layer model parallel approach that enables training transformer models with billions of parameters. Our approach does not require a new compiler or library changes, is orthogonal and complimentary to pipeline model parallelism, and can be fully implemented with the insertion of a few communication operations in native PyTorch. We illustrate this approach by converging transformer based models up to 8.3 billion parameters using 512 GPUs. We sustain 15.1 PetaFLOPs across the entire application with 76% scaling efficiency when compared to a strong single GPU baseline that sustains 39 TeraFLOPs, which is 30% of peak FLOPs. To demonstrate that large language models can further advance the state of the art (SOTA), we train an 8.3 billion parameter transformer language model similar to GPT-2 and a 3.9 billion parameter model similar to BERT. We show that careful attention to the placement of layer normalization in BERT-like models is critical to achieving increased performance as the model size grows. Using the GPT-2 model we achieve SOTA results on the WikiText103 (10.8 compared to SOTA perplexity of 15.8) and LAMBADA (66.5% compared to SOTA accuracy of 63.2%) datasets. Our BERT model achieves SOTA results on the RACE dataset (90.9% compared to SOTA accuracy of 89.4%).\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Google's Neural Machine Translation System: Bridging the Gap between Human and Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: parallel normalization techniques*\n\n*Macduff Hughes, Hideto Kazawa, Stephan Gouws, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Apurva Shah, Zhifeng Chen, Yoshikiyo Kato, Xiaobing Liu, Taku Kudo, Mohammad Norouzi, Jeff Klingner, Greg Corrado, Alex Rudnick, Quoc V.

Unfortunately, NMT systems are\nknown to be computationally expensive both in training and in translation\ninference. Also, most NMT systems have difficulty with rare words. These issues\nhave hindered NMT's use in practical deployments and services, where both\naccuracy and speed are essential. In this work, we present GNMT, Google's\nNeural Machine Translation system, which attempts to address many of these\nissues. Our model consists of a deep LSTM network with 8 encoder and 8 decoder\nlayers using attention and residual connections. To improve parallelism and\ntherefore decrease training time, our attention mechanism connects the bottom\nlayer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder. To accelerate the final\ntranslation speed, we employ low-precision arithmetic during inference\ncomputations. To improve handling of rare words, we divide words into a limited\nset of common sub-word units (\"wordpieces\") for both input and output. This\nmethod provides a good balance between the flexibility of \"character\"-delimited\nmodels and the efficiency of \"word\"-delimited models, naturally handles\ntranslation of rare words, and ultimately improves the overall accuracy of the\nsystem. Our beam search technique employs a length-normalization procedure and\nuses a coverage penalty, which encourages generation of an output sentence that\nis most likely to cover all the words in the source sentence. On the WMT'14\nEnglish-to-French and English-to-German benchmarks, GNMT achieves competitive\nresults to state-of-the-art. Using a human side-by-side evaluation on a set of\nisolated simple sentences, it reduces translation errors by an average of 60%\ncompared to Google's phrase-based production system.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on memory-efficient implementations of state space models and parallel processing techniques for normalization layers, here are some recent advances and relevant information:\n\n## Memory-Efficient State Space Models\n\n### Mamba and Taipan Architectures\nState Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba and its variants have shown promising results in reducing computational and memory requirements compared to traditional Transformer models.\n\n- **Mamba-2**: This model uses a selective data-dependent mechanism and structured state-space duality (SSD), allowing it to generalize linear attention and maintain constant memory usage during inference. Mamba-2 has been shown to perform comparably to Transformers in certain tasks while being more efficient.\n- **Taipan**: This hybrid architecture combines Mamba-2 with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). Taipan balances the efficiency of Mamba with the performance of Transformers by identifying tokens requiring long-range interactions and augmenting their representations using attention modules. This approach extends accurate predictions to context lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n### SC-MAMBA2\nFor handling extremely long sequences, such as in single-cell ultra-long transcriptome data, SC-MAMBA2 leverages state-space models to model full gene sequences efficiently. This model introduces design modifications and a bidirectional modeling approach, enabling it to handle sequences encompassing 60,530 genes, which is the largest and most comprehensive sequence length handled in the single-cell transcriptomics domain to date.\n\n## Parallel Processing Techniques for Normalization Layers\n\n### Hierarchical Processing and Parallelization\nTo integrate hierarchical processing with parallel computation, the following approaches are noteworthy:\n\n- **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm**: While not explicitly detailed in the sources, the concept of hierarchical structures can be parallelized effectively. For instance, hierarchical processing can be implemented using residual block backbones, similar to how xLSTM integrates modified LSTM memory structures into residual block backbones. This allows for efficient parallelization of hierarchical structures.\n- **Parallel Normalization Techniques**: In the context of xLSTM, exponential gating and modified memory structures are introduced. These modifications include scalar memory, scalar update, and new memory mixing, which can be parallelized. The use of matrix memory and covariance update rules in mLSTM also enables full parallelizability, which can be applied to normalization layers to enhance efficiency.\n\n## Integration Strategies and Performance Improvements\n\n### Combining SSMs with Normalization Layers\n- **State Space Duality (SSD)**: The concept of SSD allows for a deep connection between SSMs and linear attention, which can be leveraged to integrate SSMs with adaptive normalization techniques. This integration can balance dynamic adaptability with computational efficiency.\n- **Selective Attention Layers (SALs)**: Taipan's use of SALs to focus attention on a subset of important tokens reduces computational costs and ensures efficiency during both training and inference. This targeted approach can be adapted to other models to enhance performance in memory-intensive tasks.\n\n### Practical Implementations and Performance\n- **Efficient Long-Context Modeling**: Taipan and Mamba-2 have demonstrated superior performance across various scales and tasks, offering practical solutions for efficient long-context language modeling. These models extend accurate predictions to extremely long sequences while preserving computational efficiency.\n- **Optimizing Dynamic Parameter Generation**: The integration of dynamic parameter generation with SSMs and hierarchical processing requires careful optimization to manage memory access patterns and ensure stability. Techniques such as adaptive budget allocation for parameter-efficient fine-tuning can be explored to optimize these processes.\n\nBy leveraging these advancements, researchers can develop more efficient and expressive autoregressive language models that balance computational efficiency with model expressiveness, manage memory access patterns effectively, and optimize dynamic parameter generation.\n",

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory. ## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a core problem in sequence prediction/modelling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Hop82, RHW ${ }^{+}$85, Elm90] are a natural choice, but are notoriously hard to train; they often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients [BSF94, PMB13] and despite techniques to mitigate the issue [HS97, $\\mathrm{CVMG}^{+}$14, ASB16], they are also hard to scale given the inherently sequential nature of their computation. In recent years, transformer models $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17 have become the staple of sequence modelling, achieving remarkable success across multiple domains $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+}\\right.$20, $\\mathrm{DBK}^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{JEP}^{+}$21]. Transformer models are naturally parallelizable and hence scale significantly better than RNNs. However, attention layers have memory/computation requirements that scale quadratically with context length. Many approximations have been proposed (see [TDBM22] for a recent survey). RNNs have seen a recent resurgence in the form of state space models (SSM) which have shown promise in modelling long sequences across varied modalities GGR21, $\\mathrm{DFS}^{+}$22, GGB22, $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23$, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23, GD23]. SSMs use linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the sequence-to sequence transform by evolving the internal state of a dynamical system according to the dynamics equations\n\n$$\nx_{t}=A x_{t-1}+B u_{t} \\quad y_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the hidden state of the dynamical system, $u_{t}$ is the input to the system, and $y_{t}$ are observations. The matrices $A, B, C, D$ govern the evolution of the system and are called system matrices. Despite its simplicity, this linear model can capture a rich set of natural dynamical systems\nin engineering and the physical sciences due to the potentially large number of hidden dimensions. Linear dynamical systems are also attractive as a sequence model because their structure is amenable to both fast inference and fast training via parallel scans [Ble89, SWL23] or convolutions [GGR21]. A rich literature stemming from control theory and recent machine learning interest has given rise to efficient techniques for system identification, filtering, and prediction for linear dynamical systems. For a survey of recent literature see [HS22]. These techniques make SSMs attractive for sequence tasks which inherently depend on long contexts that scale poorly for transformers. Examples include large language models [DFS ${ }^{+}$22], modelling time series [ZSP ${ }^{+}$23], and audio generation [GGDR22]. To understand the factors affecting the memory in an SSM or simply a linear dynamical system, we now proceed to delineate how past states and inputs affect the future. Geometric decay in LDS. The linear equations governing the dynamics are recursive in nature, and imply that in a noiseless environment, the $t$ 'th output can be written as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}=C\\left(A x_{t-1}+B u_{t}\\right)+D u_{t}=\\ldots=\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nThe matrix $A$ is asymmetric in general, and can have complex eigenvalues. If the amplitude of these eigenvalues is $>1$, then the output $y_{t}$ can grow without bounds. This is called an \"explosive\" system. In a well-behaved system, the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitude $<1$. If the magnitudes are bounded away from 1 , say $\\left|\\lambda_{i}(A)\\right|<1-\\delta$, for some $\\delta>0$ (referred to as spectral gap), then we can write\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+\\omega_{k},\\left\\|\\omega_{k}\\right\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor $k=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This mathematical fact implies that the effective memory of the system is on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$. In general, the parameter $\\delta$ is unknown apriori and can get arbitrarily small as we approach systems with have long range dependencies leading to instability in training linear dynamical systems with a long context. This issue is specifically highlighted in the work of [ $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+}$23] who observe that on long range tasks learning an LDS directly does not succeed and requires interventions such as stable exponential parameterizations and specific normalization which have been repeatedly used either implicitly or explicitly in the SSM literature [GGR21]. Unfortunately these reparametrizations and normalizations come with no theoretical guarantees. In fact this limitation is generally known to be fundamental to the use of linear dynamical systems, and can only be circumvented via a significant increase in sample complexity $\\left[\\mathrm{GLS}^{+}\\right.$20] or via control over the input sequence [SMT ${ }^{+}$18]. Spectral filtering for linear dynamical systems. A notable deviation from the standard theory of linear dynamical systems that allows efficient learning in the presence of arbitrarily long memory is the technique of spectral filtering [HSZ17]. The idea is to project the sequence of inputs to a small subspace that is constructed using special structure of discrete LDS where successive powers of the system matrix appear in the impulse response function. The basic idea is to represent the output as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} M_{j}\\left(\\sum_{i} \\phi_{j}(i) \\cdot u_{t-i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{j}$ are spectral filters which are sequence-length sized vectors that given the target sequence length can be computed offline, and $M_{j}$ are matrices parameterizing the model. These spectral-filters are the eigenvectors of the matrix constructed as the average of outer products of the discrete impulseresponse functions, viz $Z=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]^{\\top} d \\alpha$. It is shown that this matrix is inherently low-dimensional and for all $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, vectors of the form $\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]$ are well approximated by the top-eigenspace of Z. Figure 1 depicts these filters. For the details of how these filters are derived and their computation, see Section 2\n\nWhy is spectral filtering important? The main advantage of spectral filtering is that for certain types of linear dynamical systems, in particular those with symmetric matrices $A$, the effective memory(measured by the number of filters) required to represent an observation at any point in the sequence in the spectral basis is independent of the spectral gap parameter $\\delta!$. This guarantee indicates that if we featurize the input into the spectral basis, we can potentially design models that\nare capable of efficiently and stably representing systems with extremely long memory even with $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. This striking fact motivates our derivation of the recurrent spectral architecture, and is the underlying justification for the performance and training stability gains we see in experiments. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_28085b3c06af8ebfb6a7g-03.jpg?height=524&width=816&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=641)\n\nFigure 1: Spectral Filters used by the Spectral Filtering Algorithm. The x-axis is the time domain. ### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nWe start by proposing state space models with learned components that apply spectral filtering for their featurization. We consider two types of spectral filters, which augment the original spectral filters proposed in HSZ17] with negative eigenvalues in two different ways. Our main contribution is a neural architecture that is based on these spectral state space models. This neural architecture can be applied recursively in layers, resulting in an expressive architecture for modeling sequential data. Finally we implement this neural architecture and apply it towards synthetically generated data as well as the Long Range Arena benchmark [TDA ${ }^{+21]}$. We demonstrate that spectral state space models can stably and more efficiently learn on sequence modelling tasks with long range dependencies without the need for exponential parameterizations, particular initializations and normalizations. Main Advantages of Spectral SSM. Previously proposed convolutional models for sequence modeling, surveyed in the related work section, learn the kernels from the data. The kernels used in Spectral SSM are theoretically-founded and fixed and thus parameter-free. In addition, our models are provably as expressive as an LDS. In particular, their expressiveness neither depends on the spectra gap nor on the dimension of the system, which are necessary in all other methods. ### 1.2 Related work\n\nDue to limited space, we provide a short overview of the most related work to us below and provide a detailed report on the related work in the appendix (Section A). State space models. SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years starting with the works [GDE $\\left.{ }^{+} 20\\right],\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ which propose and develop the HiPPO theory. [GGR21] develop the S4 parameterization to address the bottlenecks of training efficiency, performance and numberical stability. The $S 4$ parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization. The S 4 model was further streamlined in later works, viz. using diagonal system matrices without a loss in performance [GGB22] and the S5 model [SWL23] which uses a MIMO diagonal system and associative scans for computational efficiency. [OSG $\\left.{ }^{+} 23\\right]$ investigate whether simpler deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer under the crucial caveat that specific modifications on linear RNNs, namely the stable exponential parameterization, $\\gamma$ - normalization and ring initialization, are necessary to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3. The Illusion of State in State-Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*William Merrill, Jackson Petty, Ashish Sabharwal*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Analysis of state-space models reveals that SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have emerged as a potential alternative architecture for building large language models (LLMs) compared to the previously ubiquitous transformer architecture. One theoretical weakness of transformers is that they cannot express certain kinds of sequential computation and state tracking (Merrill&Sabharwal, 2023), which SSMs are explicitly designed to address via their close architectural similarity to recurrent neural networks (RNNs). But do SSMs truly have an advantage (over transformers) in expressive power for state tracking? Surprisingly, the answer is no. Our analysis reveals that the expressive power of SSMs is limited very similarly to transformers: SSMs cannot express computation outside the complexity class $\\mathsf{TC}^0$. In particular, this means they cannot solve simple state-tracking problems like permutation composition. It follows that SSMs are provably unable to accurately track chess moves with certain notation, evaluate code, or track entities in a long narrative. To supplement our formal analysis, we report experiments showing that Mamba-style SSMs indeed struggle with state tracking. Thus, despite its recurrent formulation, the\"state\"in an SSM is an illusion: SSMs have similar expressiveness limitations to non-recurrent models like transformers, which may fundamentally limit their ability to solve real-world state-tracking problems.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/39 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv:2312.00752.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/37 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

SLAB: Efficient Transformers with Simplified Linear Attention and Progressive Re-parameterized Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient SSM normalization*\n\n*Jialong Guo, Xinghao Chen, Yehui Tang, Yunhe Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method named PRepBN is proposed to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training and a simplified linear attention (SLA) module is proposed that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have become foundational architectures for both natural language and computer vision tasks. However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference. However, replacing LayerNorm with more efficient BatchNorm in transformer often leads to inferior performance and collapse in training. To address this problem, we propose a novel method named PRepBN to progressively replace LayerNorm with re-parameterized BatchNorm in training. Moreover, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module that is simple yet effective to achieve strong performance. Extensive experiments on image classification as well as object detection demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with $16.2$ms latency, which is $2.4$ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1\\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.Codes are publicly available at https://github.com/xinghaochen/SLAB and https://github.com/mindspore-lab/models/tree/master/research/huawei-noah/SLAB.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient SSM normalization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime.

Norm matters: efficient and accurate normalization schemes in deep networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient SSM normalization*\n\n*Elad Hoffer, Ron Banner, Itay Golan, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel view is presented on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective, and a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Over the past few years, Batch-Normalization has been commonly used in deep networks, allowing faster training and high performance for a wide variety of applications. However, the reasons behind its merits remained unanswered, with several shortcomings that hindered its use for certain tasks. In this work, we present a novel view on the purpose and function of normalization methods and weight-decay, as tools to decouple weights' norm from the underlying optimized objective. This property highlights the connection between practices such as normalization, weight decay and learning-rate adjustments. We suggest several alternatives to the widely used $L^2$ batch-norm, using normalization in $L^1$ and $L^\\infty$ spaces that can substantially improve numerical stability in low-precision implementations as well as provide computational and memory benefits. We demonstrate that such methods enable the first batch-norm alternative to work for half-precision implementations. Finally, we suggest a modification to weight-normalization, which improves its performance on large-scale tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 175  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 4.

These schemes are often heuristic and fixed over the course of training. We empirically observe that the statistics of gradients of deep models change during the training. Motivated by this observation, we introduce two adaptive quantization schemes, ALQ and AMQ. In both schemes, processors update their compression schemes in parallel by efficiently computing sufficient statistics of a parametric distribution. We improve the validation accuracy by almost 2% on CIFAR-10 and 1% on ImageNet in challenging low-cost communication setups. Our adaptive methods are also significantly more robust to the choice of hyperparameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Fast and Robust Early-Exiting Framework for Autoregressive Language Models with Synchronized Parallel Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: parallel adaptive processing*\n\n*Sangmin Bae, Jongwoo Ko, Hwanjun Song, SeYoung Yun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework, which incorporates a shallow-deep module and a synchronized parallel decoding that enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens.\n\n**Abstract:** To tackle the high inference latency exhibited by autoregressive language models, previous studies have proposed an early-exiting framework that allocates adaptive computation paths for each token based on the complexity of generating the subsequent token. However, we observed several shortcomings, including performance degradation caused by a state copying mechanism or numerous exit paths, and sensitivity to exit confidence thresholds. Consequently, we propose a Fast and Robust Early-Exiting (FREE) framework, which incorporates a shallow-deep module and a synchronized parallel decoding. Our framework enables faster inference by synchronizing the decoding process of the current token with previously stacked early-exited tokens. Furthermore, as parallel decoding allows us to observe predictions from both shallow and deep models, we present a novel adaptive threshold estimator that exploits a Beta mixture model to determine suitable confidence thresholds. We empirically demonstrated the superiority of our proposed framework on extensive generation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. Adaptive End-to-End Metric Learning for Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Slot Filling\n\n*From Search Query: parallel adaptive processing*\n\n*Yuanjun Shi, Linzhi Wu, Minglai Shao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A cascade-style joint learning framework coupled with context-aware soft label representations and slot-level contrastive representation learning to mitigate the data and label shift problems effectively and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over a series of competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently slot filling has witnessed great development thanks to deep learning and the availability of large-scale annotated data. However, it poses a critical challenge to handle a novel domain whose samples are never seen during training. The recognition performance might be greatly degraded due to severe domain shifts. Most prior works deal with this problem in a two-pass pipeline manner based on metric learning. In practice, these dominant pipeline models may be limited in computational efficiency and generalization capacity because of non-parallel inference and context-free discrete label embeddings. To this end, we re-examine the typical metric-based methods, and propose a new adaptive end-to-end metric learning scheme for the challenging zero-shot slot filling. Considering simplicity, efficiency and generalizability, we present a cascade-style joint learning framework coupled with context-aware soft label representations and slot-level contrastive representation learning to mitigate the data and label shift problems effectively. Extensive experiments on public benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the proposed approach over a series of competitive baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Mamba-ST: State Space Model for Efficient Style Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient SSM normalization*\n\n*Andrea Prati, Massimo Bertozzi, Claudio Ferrari, Tomaso Fontanini, Leonardo Rossi, Alex Ergasti, Filippo Botti*\n\n**Abstract:** The goal of style transfer is, given a content image and a style source, generating a new image preserving the content but with the artistic representation of the style source. Most of the state-of-the-art architectures use transformers or diffusion-based models to perform this task, despite the heavy computational burden that they require. In particular, transformers use self- and cross-attention layers which have large memory footprint, while diffusion models require high inference time. To overcome the above, this paper explores a novel design of Mamba, an emergent State-Space Model (SSM), called Mamba-ST, to perform style transfer. To do so, we adapt Mamba linear equation to simulate the behavior of cross-attention layers, which are able to combine two separate embeddings into a single output, but drastically reducing memory usage and time complexity. We modified the Mamba's inner equations so to accept inputs from, and combine, two separate data streams. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to adapt the equations of SSMs to a vision task like style transfer without requiring any other module like cross-attention or custom normalization layers. An extensive set of experiments demonstrates the superiority and efficiency of our method in performing style transfer compared to transformers and diffusion models. Results show improved quality in terms of both ArtFID and FID metrics.

Desiderata for 2D inductive bias include two-dimensional position awareness, dynamic spatial locality, and translation and permutation invariance. To address these goals, we leverage an expressive variation of the multidimensional State Space Model (SSM). Our approach introduces efficient parameterization, accelerated computation, and a suitable normalization scheme. Empirically, we observe that incorporating our layer at the beginning of each transformer block of Vision Transformers (ViT) significantly enhances performance for multiple ViT backbones and across datasets. The new layer is effective even with a negligible amount of additional parameters and inference time. Ablation studies and visualizations demonstrate that the layer has a strong 2-D inductive bias. For example, vision transformers equipped with our layer exhibit effective performance even without positional encoding\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: parallel adaptive processing*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Because of their success, the size of these models has increased rapidly, requiring high-performance hardware, software, and algorithmic techniques to enable training such large models. As the result of a joint effort between Microsoft and NVIDIA, we present details on the training of the largest monolithic transformer based language model, Megatron-Turing NLG 530B (MT-NLG), with 530 billion parameters. In this paper, we first focus on the infrastructure as well as the 3D parallelism methodology used to train this model using DeepSpeed and Megatron. Next, we detail the training process, the design of our training corpus, and our data curation techniques, which we believe is a key ingredient to the success of the model. Finally, we discuss various evaluation results, as well as other interesting observations and new properties exhibited by MT-NLG. We demonstrate that MT-NLG achieves superior zero-, one-, and few-shot learning accuracies on several NLP benchmarks and establishes new state-of-the-art results. We believe that our contributions will help further the development of large-scale training infrastructures, large-scale language models, and natural language generations.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating state space models (SSMs) with adaptive normalization mechanisms, focusing on stability and efficiency, here are some key techniques and insights from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Efficient State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n### Parallel Processing and Efficiency\n- Deep state space models (SSMs) can be configured for efficient online inference and parallelized training, which is crucial for autoregressive models. Using Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs) to perform convolutions in the frequency domain can achieve significant speedups, as mentioned in.\n- The use of multi-input, multi-output SSMs allows for efficient training and integration of multiple scales, similar to the approach in \"Simplified State Space Layers\" where SSMs match the computational efficiency of other models while achieving state-of-the-art performance.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization and Stability\n- To combine SSMs with adaptive normalization, one can leverage techniques like layer-adaptive state pruning (LAST) which optimizes the state dimension of each layer to minimize model-level energy loss. This method ensures stability and reduces unnecessary computational and memory costs.\n- Stability-guaranteed diagonal SSMs can be employed, where diagonal systems are trained to satisfy necessary and sufficient stability conditions. This approach ensures that the model remains stable while adapting to different input sequences.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing and Parallel Computation\n- Integrating hierarchical processing with parallel computation can be achieved by using a heterogeneous design principle, similar to classical CNN designs. This involves gradually downsampling the temporal dimension as the network deepens, allowing for efficient parallel processing of hierarchical structures.\n- The use of transfer function parameterization can optimize memory usage and enhance the efficiency of state processing. This approach is highlighted in the context of state-free inference algorithms, which do not incur significant memory or computational costs with an increase in state size.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Mechanisms\n\n### Combining with SSMs\n- Adaptive normalization mechanisms can be integrated with SSMs by using techniques that adaptively prune or adjust the state dimensions based on their significance. For example, the LAST method evaluates the importance of each state and prunes insignificant ones, which can be combined with adaptive normalization to ensure that the model remains efficient and stable.\n\n### Memory Optimization and Efficiency\n- To balance state-free processing with adaptive mechanisms, it is crucial to optimize memory access patterns. Techniques like FlashAttention, which is fast and memory-efficient, can be adapted for SSMs to ensure efficient memory usage during dynamic parameter generation.\n\n## Stability Analysis and Bidirectional Processing\n\n### Stability Considerations\n- Stability analysis is critical when using bidirectional state processing. Ensuring that the model satisfies stability conditions, such as those in stability-guaranteed diagonal SSMs, is essential to maintain performance and prevent divergence.\n\n### Bidirectional State Processing\n- Bidirectional state processing can enhance feature capture by marking sequences with position embeddings and compressing visual representations, as seen in \"Vision Mamba.\" This approach can be adapted for autoregressive language models to improve their ability to capture long-range dependencies.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that integrates the strengths of SSMs with adaptive normalization mechanisms, ensuring efficiency, stability, and improved performance.\n\n### Key References\n- **Deep State Space Models**: and provide insights into efficient SSM designs, parallel processing, and stability considerations.\n- **Adaptive Normalization and Pruning**: discusses layer-adaptive state pruning (LAST) which can be integrated with adaptive normalization.\n- **Efficient Processing**: and highlight methods for efficient parallel processing and memory optimization.\n",

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/30 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIndeed, the joint distribution from which both present and past data could have been jointly drawn can change with every sample. Therefore, optimality is not measured relative to one unknown distribution, as in generalization bounds, but rather relative to all possible distributions. If the data is generated by a physically realizable process, such distributions are computable. Optimal inference measured on average over all possible computable distributions, weighted by the Universal Prior, has been described by Solomonoff [38]. Solomonoff-style inference can be thought of as the limit of transduction, and similarly involves no learning. Instead, it consists of cycling through all computable programs using a Universal Turing Machine, which requires infinite time, memory, and compute resources, which in turn renders such inference unattainable. Nonetheless, this Solomonoff limit points to two directions for improving inference: (a) efficient memorization, ideally by losslessly encoding all past data, and (b) efficient test-time computation through hardware and model co-design. Ideally, the resulting realizations would be such that, if memory and compute resources were extrapolated to infinity, inference would approach the Solomonoff limit. In reality, inference is always resource bound, so if something has to grow it would have to be external to the core inference engine. Accordingly, our goal in this work is to design and analyze families of architectures that (a) natively incorporate retrieval from a growing external memory (retrieval-augmented generation, or RAG), and (b) can scale to perform efficient inference computation. [^1]In order to design families of architectures that efficiently memorize and scale inference computation, we must exploit the structure of the data they realize. When past and present data are known to be independent and identically distributed (IID) one can encode inference computation through a fixed \"stateless\" map, or model, which is a representation that can be trained inductively regardless of the inference query. When past and future data are not IID but generated by a Markov process of known order, there exist finite-dimensional statistics, called states, that summarize all past data for the purpose of prediction [23, 20, 27]. But even if the underlying process is Markovian of bounded order, unless such an order is known a-priori optimal realization is generally not possible with constant complexity [31]. To perform optimal inference, memory has to grow, and if the data generation mechanism has finite complexity at some point an efficient encoding of past data into memory will stop growing, but it is not possible to know when [1]. Therefore, a suitable architecture has to always allow the possibility of adding new storage. In the seventies, Stochastic Realization Theory [11] studied State Space Models (SSMs) under the known-order Markov assumption, since realizations with growing memory were unmanageable then. ${ }^{4}$ Today, Foundation Models can ingest a large portion of the growing volume of data accessible through the Internet and make it available for inference. Current AI systems are typically hardconstrained by inference time and compute resources, but not by storage-one can always add more disks. To extend Stochastic Realization beyond the IID or known-Markov cases, Foundation Models need scalable architectures that comprise short-term memory updated synchronously within the given computational constraints and long-term memory updated and accessed sparingly and asynchronously. The former includes both eidetic (lossless) and fading (lossy) memory for efficient computation, while the latter is akin to an integrated form of \"retrieval-augmented\" inference. Such architectures would seamlessly manage short-term eidetic memory \"in-context\", fading memory \"in-state\", long-term structural memory \"in-weights\" and long-term eidetic memory 'in-storage' [13]. Existing architectures such as Transformers and SSMs fall short of encompassing these criteria. Transformer-based architectures use eidetic memory restricted to a finite span, \"context length\" [6, 21], while recent SSM-based architectures [17, 15, 46] use only fading memory in their state. In both cases, scaling requires allowing the context (and the key-value cache) or recurrent state to grow unbounded. Recent work on hybrid combinations of Transformer and State Space layers [26, 35, 10] show promise in striking a balance between eidetic memory, fading memory and compute. ### 1.1 Contributions\n\nIn this work, we describe a class of models that encompasses both recent SSMs [17], Transformers [21], and hybrid architectures [26, 10] as special cases, which we call B\u2019MOJO. This model family simultaneously renders the high expressivity and recall of Transformers, and the high compute efficiency of SSMs. And, rather than assigning tokens to the attention mechanism by recency, an asynchronous selection mechanism assigns tokens based on unpredictability. That is, whenever the model processes a new token that cannot be well-explained it will append it to the registers that implement B'MOJO's eidetic memory-a process we call Innovation Selection. We demonstrate through synthetic tasks that B'MOJO outperforms existing SSM and hybrid model architectures in transductive inference. Empirically, we show that our implementation is $15 \\%$ faster than similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs while achieving comparable perplexity on language model tasks up to the 1.4B scale. Finally, we show that B'MOJO can operate effectively at inference time on sequences far longer (tested up to $4 \\times$ ) than those used for training. Specifically, experiments with a B'MOJO architecture trained with sequences of at most 8 K tokens show consistent length generalization on test sequences of 32 K tokens. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\nWe start with a general overview of models for sequence data, whether of text tokens (Large Language Models), images (e.g., Vision Language Models), video, or other physical sensory data (World Models). Any predictive model inferred from a sequence is called a realization ${ }^{5}$ If one assumes that there exists one \"true\" model, coming from a known model class, then the problem of realization\n\n[^2]reduces to System Identification [29], which is to estimate the true model parameters from data. If the model is linear and driven by Gaussian noise, the Cayley-Hamilton theorem [22] implies that the model's \"true\" order can be inferred with a variety of model selection criteria, including greedy selection. Otherwise, the rank of the non-linear analog of the observability matrix, the Observability Codistribution, can grow in fits and starts, making greedy model selection undecidable [19]. If not only the model class, but the model itself are known, then the problem further reduces to filtering or prediction, which for the linear-Gaussian case can be implemented as a closed-form iterative update [23]. When building a (generally non-unique) realization, all one is given is the data, which leaves complete freedom of choice of model class and order, or number of free parameters. Stochastic Realization. A \"sequence model\" is a mathematical representation of sequential data capable of predicting the next datum in the sequence given previous ones. The Wiener Filter [43] was among the earliest to be deployed, superseded by the Kalman Filter [23], the first State Space Model (SSM) with an explicit \"state\" updated recursively. The ensuing decades saw extensions to more general models leading to Stochastic Realization Theory [27]. The general problem of stochastic realization is, given a (potentially infinite) sequence $\\left\\{\\ldots, u_{t-1}, u_{t}\\right\\} \\doteq u_{\\leq t}$ observed up to time $t$, infer (i.e., \"learn\") some parametric model, a function $\\phi$ with parameters $\\theta, \\phi_{\\theta}\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right)$ such that the prediction $\\hat{u}_{t+1}=\\phi_{\\theta}\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right)$ yields a residual $\\epsilon_{t+1}=u_{t+1}-\\hat{u}_{t+1}$ (\"innovation process\") that is as close as possible to independent and identically distributed samples (IID). In a nutshell, an optimal predictor is one that makes the prediction error unpredictable. State. The state of a model is a statistic that makes the future independent of the past. In particular, such a statistic (function of past data) $\\xi\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right)$ yields to the following conditional entropy equality $H\\left(u_{t+1} \\mid \\xi\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right), u_{\\leq t}\\right)=H\\left(u_{t+1} \\mid \\xi\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right)\\right)$ relative to the joint distribution of all past and present data [29, 28]. Trivially, the data itself fits the definition of state with $\\xi\\left(u_{\\leq t}\\right)=u_{\\leq t}$, but it grows unbounded over time. Instead, one seeks a bounded complexity state given which all past data can be ignored with no loss of information. To build such a state is the core goal of stochastic realization. Elementary model classes: LTI, LTV and LIV. Any finite sequence can be realized by a linear time-invariant (LTI) system driven by IID Gaussian noise [27]. It would therefore appear that this model class is sufficient for any practical purpose, and we need models no more expressive than linear time-invariant ones driven by white zero-mean Gaussian noise $]^{6}$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_22043a3d19899a4beb33g-04.jpg?height=105&width=1225&top_left_y=1460&top_left_x=450)\n\nGiven observations $y_{0: t}$, stochastic realization deals with the problem of inferring an equivalence class of model parameters $A, B, C$ [40] and a state $x_{t}$ along with a covariance matrix $P_{t}$ of $\\left[u_{t}, v_{t}\\right]$ that can be propagated deterministically to approximate trajectories produced by the underlying \"exo-system\" or data generation mechanism, $y_{0: t}$ [44]. However, arbitrarily long and complex time series would require a growing state and therefore making the model no longer time invariant. More expressive model classes, such as time-varying [20] and input-varying [25] afford more efficient representation by considering $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}$ known functions of time (Linear-Time Varying) or of their input (LinearInput Varying, LIV). As we describe next, a special case of LIV model class where the dependency on the input is linear, resulting in a so-called bilinear realization, is gathering considerable attention lately (Mamba [17], Griffin [10] and Gated Linear Attention [46]). Modern realizations. Input-dependent (bilinear) models gathered considerable attention half a century ago starting with Brockett [5], when [25] showed that \"every nonlinear system with controls entering linearly is locally almost bilinear\"; [11] developed a complete realization theory for this class of systems including minimal realizations, and showed that they not only minimize the dimension of the state, but also minimize the number of operations necessary for the update. Most recently, special cases of bilinear realizations are being used as building blocks in stacked architectures like Mamba [17], Jamba [26] and Griffin [10]; they refer to input-dependency as \"selectivity\" and combine attention mechanisms and other techniques to scale up to 52B parameters. These models differ by their choices of $A, B, C$, each with its own advantages and limitations which we overcome as described next.

(Left) Illustration of the B'MOJO layer. (Right) B'MOJO's Realization. B'MOJO's fading memory is computed by a SSM that represents longrange dependencies through its state (a fixed-dimensional representation) which is later aggregated along with with the most recent past. B'MOJO's eidetic memory stores tokens selected from the past using an innovation test on the SSM's state and appends them to the current sliding window. The innovation test measures how difficult it is to predict the next token using the SSM's state. If a token is difficult to predict, we store it in the eidetic memory and pass it to the attention module together with the state, a compressed summary of the past, and the most recent tokens. ## 3 B'MOJO\n\nWe now introduce B'MOJO, a general family of architectures based on a stackable module, designed to foster transductive inference.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/30 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n# B\u2019MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory \n\nLuca Zancato* Arjun Seshadri Yonatan Dukler Aditya Golatkar Yantao Shen<br>Benjamin Bowman Matthew Trager Alessandro Achille Stefano Soatto\n\nAWS AI Labs\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nWe describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

High-Performance Large-Scale Image Recognition Without Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference adaptive normalization*\n\n*Andrew Brock, Soham De, Samuel L. Smith, K. Simonyan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An adaptive gradient clipping technique is developed which overcomes instabilities in batch normalization, and a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets is designed, achieving significantly better performance when finetuning on ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Batch normalization is a key component of most image classification models, but it has many undesirable properties stemming from its dependence on the batch size and interactions between examples. Although recent work has succeeded in training deep ResNets without normalization layers, these models do not match the test accuracies of the best batch-normalized networks, and are often unstable for large learning rates or strong data augmentations. In this work, we develop an adaptive gradient clipping technique which overcomes these instabilities, and design a significantly improved class of Normalizer-Free ResNets. Our smaller models match the test accuracy of an EfficientNet-B7 on ImageNet while being up to 8.7x faster to train, and our largest models attain a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy of 86.5%. In addition, Normalizer-Free models attain significantly better performance than their batch-normalized counterparts when finetuning on ImageNet after large-scale pre-training on a dataset of 300 million labeled images, with our best models obtaining an accuracy of 89.2%.

Although conventionally people conduct conformal prediction in the output space, this is not the only possibility. In this paper, we propose feature conformal prediction, which extends the scope of conformal prediction to semantic feature spaces by leveraging the inductive bias of deep representation learning. From a theoretical perspective, we demonstrate that feature conformal prediction provably outperforms regular conformal prediction under mild assumptions. Our approach could be combined with not only vanilla conformal prediction, but also other adaptive conformal prediction methods. Apart from experiments on existing predictive inference benchmarks, we also demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed methods on large-scale tasks such as ImageNet classification and Cityscapes image segmentation.The code is available at \\url{https://github.com/AlvinWen428/FeatureCP}.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. DELTA: degradation-free fully test-time adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference adaptive normalization*\n\n*Bowen Zhao, Chen Chen, Shutao Xia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics, and Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fully test-time adaptation aims at adapting a pre-trained model to the test stream during real-time inference, which is urgently required when the test distribution differs from the training distribution. Several efforts have been devoted to improving adaptation performance. However, we find that two unfavorable defects are concealed in the prevalent adaptation methodologies like test-time batch normalization (BN) and self-learning. First, we reveal that the normalization statistics in test-time BN are completely affected by the currently received test samples, resulting in inaccurate estimates. Second, we show that during test-time adaptation, the parameter update is biased towards some dominant classes. In addition to the extensively studied test stream with independent and class-balanced samples, we further observe that the defects can be exacerbated in more complicated test environments, such as (time) dependent or class-imbalanced data. We observe that previous approaches work well in certain scenarios while show performance degradation in others due to their faults. In this paper, we provide a plug-in solution called DELTA for Degradation-freE fuLly Test-time Adaptation, which consists of two components: (i) Test-time Batch Renormalization (TBR), introduced to improve the estimated normalization statistics. (ii) Dynamic Online re-weighTing (DOT), designed to address the class bias within optimization. We investigate various test-time adaptation methods on three commonly used datasets with four scenarios, and a newly introduced real-world dataset. DELTA can help them deal with all scenarios simultaneously, leading to SOTA performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Text2Topic: Multi-Label Text Classification System for Efficient Topic Detection in User Generated Content with Zero-Shot Capabilities\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream SSM processing*\n\n*Fengjun Wang, Moran Beladev, Ofri Kleinfeld, Elina Frayerman, Tal Shachar, Eran Fainman, Karen Lastmann Assaraf, Sarai Mizrachi, Benjamin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Text to Topic (Text2Topic), which achieves high multi-label classification performance by employing a Bi-Encoder Transformer architecture that utilizes concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication of embeddings on both text and topic.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-label text classification is a critical task in the industry. It helps to extract structured information from large amount of textual data. We propose Text to Topic (Text2Topic), which achieves high multi-label classification performance by employing a Bi-Encoder Transformer architecture that utilizes concatenation, subtraction, and multiplication of embeddings on both text and topic. Text2Topic also supports zero-shot predictions, produces domain-specific text embeddings, and enables production-scale batch-inference with high throughput. The final model achieves accurate and comprehensive results compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including large language models (LLMs). In this study, a total of 239 topics are defined, and around 1.6 million text-topic pairs annotations (in which 200K are positive) are collected on approximately 120K texts from 3 main data sources on Booking.com. The data is collected with optimized smart sampling and partial labeling. The final Text2Topic model is deployed on a real-world stream processing platform, and it outperforms other models with 92.9% micro mAP, as well as a 75.8% macro mAP score. We summarize the modeling choices which are extensively tested through ablation studies, and share detailed in-production decision-making steps.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Single-pass Streaming Lower Bounds for Multi-armed Bandits Exploration with Instance-sensitive Sample Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream SSM processing*\n\n*Sepehr Assadi, Chen Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stochastic MABs in the streaming model with the instance-sensitive sample complexity, i.e. the sample complexity of O ( (cid:80) ni =2 1\u2206 2[ i ] log log ( 1\u2206 [ i ] )) is extended, similar in spirit to Karnin et.al.\n\n**Abstract:** Motivated by applications to process massive datasets, we study streaming algorithms for pure exploration in Stochastic Multi Armed Bandits (MABs). This problem was \ufb01rst formulated by Assadi and Wang [STOC 2020] as follows: A collection of n arms with unknown rewards are arriving one by one in a stream, and the algorithm is only allowed to store a limited number of arms at any point. The goal is to \ufb01nd the arm with the largest reward while minimizing the number of arm pulls (sample complexity) and the maximum number of stored arms (space complexity). Assuming \u2206 [2] is known, Assadi and Wang designed an algorithm that uses a memory of just one arm and still achieves the sample complexity of O ( n/ \u2206 2[2] ) which is worst-case optimal even for non-streaming algorithms; here \u2206 [ i ] is the gap between the rewards of the best and the i -th best arms. In this paper, we extended this line of work to stochastic MABs in the streaming model with the instance-sensitive sample complexity, i.e. the sample complexity of O ( (cid:80) ni =2 1\u2206 2[ i ] log log ( 1\u2206 [ i ] )) , similar in spirit to Karnin et.al. [ICML 2013] and Jamieson et.al. [COLT 2014] in the classical setting. We devise strong negative results under this setting: our results show that any streaming algorithm under a single pass has to use either asymptotically higher sample complexity than the instance-sensitive bound, or a memory of \u2126( n ) arms, even if the parameter \u2206 [2] is known. In fact, the lower bound holds under much stronger assumptions, including the random order streams or the knowledge of all gap parameters { \u2206 [ i ] } ni =2 . We complement our lower bounds by proposing a new algorithm that uses a memory of a single arm and\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Towards Effective Multi-Modal Interchanges in Zero-Resource Sounding Object Localization\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream SSM processing*\n\n*Yang Zhao, Chen Zhang, Haifeng Huang, Haoyuan Li, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions, and develops an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of the model.\n\n**Abstract:** Aiming to locate the object that emits a specified sound in complex scenes, the task of sounding object localization bridges two perception-oriented modalities of vision and acoustics, and brings enormous research value to the comprehensive perceptual understanding of machine intelligence. Although there are massive training data collected in this field, few of them contain accurate bounding box annotations, hindering the learning process and further application of proposed models. In order to address this problem, we try to explore an effective multi-modal knowledge transfer strategy to obtain precise knowledge from other similar tasks and transfer it through well-aligned multi-modal data to deal with this task in a zero-resource manner. Concretely, we design and propose a novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions. The former is utilized to extract the knowledge related to referring object localization from the image grounding task, while the latter is devised to learn a universal semantic space shared between texts and audios. Moreover, we further develop an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of our model. The extensive experiments on various publicly-available benchmarks demonstrate that TURN can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches without using any data in this field, which verifies the feasibility of our proposed mechanisms and strategies.

However, the BN layer is costly to calculate and is typically implemented with non-binary parameters, leaving a hurdle for the efficient implementation of BNN training. It also introduces undesirable dependence between samples within each batch. Inspired by the latest advance on Batch Normalization Free (BN-Free) training, we extend their framework to training BNNs, and for the first time demonstrate that BNs can be completed removed from BNN training and inference regimes. By plugging in and customizing techniques including adaptive gradient clipping, scale weight standardization, and specialized bottleneck block, a BN-free BNN is capable of maintaining competitive accuracy compared to its BN-based counterpart. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposal across diverse BNN backbones and datasets. For example, after removing BNs from the state-of-the-art ReActNets, it can still be trained with our proposed methodology to achieve 92.08%, 68.34%, and 68.0% accuracy on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet respectively, with marginal performance drop (0.23%~0.44% on CIFAR and 1.40% on ImageNet).

Optimization-Free Test-Time Adaptation for Cross-Person Activity Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference adaptive normalization*\n\n*Hongxin Wei, Lei Zhang, Bob Zhang, Huajun Xi, Jindong Wang, Shuoyuan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human Activity Recognition (HAR) models often suffer from performance degradation in real-world applications due to distribution shifts in activity patterns across individuals. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) is an emerging learning paradigm that aims to utilize the test stream to adjust predictions in real-time inference, which has not been explored in HAR before. However, the high computational cost of optimization-based TTA algorithms makes it intractable to run on resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose an Optimization-Free Test-Time Adaptation (OFTTA) framework for sensor-based HAR. OFTTA adjusts the feature extractor and linear classifier simultaneously in an optimization-free manner. For the feature extractor, we propose Exponential DecayTest-time Normalization (EDTN) to replace the conventional batch normalization (CBN) layers. EDTN combines CBN and Test-time batch Normalization (TBN) to extract reliable features against domain shifts with TBN's influence decreasing exponentially in deeper layers. For the classifier, we adjust the prediction by computing the distance between the feature and the prototype, which is calculated by a maintained support set. In addition, the update of the support set is based on the pseudo label, which can benefit from reliable features extracted by EDTN. Extensive experiments on three public cross-person HAR datasets and two different TTA settings demonstrate that OFTTA outperforms the state-of-the-art TTA approaches in both classification performance and computational efficiency. Finally, we verify the superiority of our proposed OFTTA on edge devices, indicating possible deployment in real applications.

State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream SSM processing*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

The concept is discussed in the context of state space models (SSMs), where traditional methods incur significant memory and computational costs with increasing state size. However, state-free inference algorithms can mitigate these issues:\n- Parnichkun et al. (2024) proposed a state-free inference approach by parameterizing the transfer functions of Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) systems, although this method has limitations such as a restrictive search space and stability guaranteed only at initialization.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization\nAdaptive normalization techniques are essential for maintaining stability and efficiency in multi-stream processing:\n- The concept of adaptive normalization can be integrated into SSMs, similar to how it is used in other deep learning models. For instance, the \"2-D SSM\" approach introduces efficient parameterization and a suitable normalization scheme, which can be adapted for state-free inference.\n- Hierarchical adaptive normalization, as seen in the HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm with TTT, can be combined with SSM-based state processing to ensure efficient and stable multi-scale processing[Analysis Note].\n\n## Multi-Stream Processing\nFor multi-stream processing, the architecture needs to efficiently handle multiple data streams without significant overhead:\n- The Mamba-ST approach modifies the inner equations to accept inputs from and combine two separate data streams without requiring additional modules like cross-attention or custom normalization layers. This can be a model for integrating multiple streams in SSMs[Analysis Note].\n- The use of multi-input multi-output (MIMO) architectures in SSMs, as discussed by Smith et al. (2023) and Parnichkun et al. (2024), enhances information usage and reduces state dimensions, making them more efficient for multi-stream processing.\n\n## Stability and Memory Efficiency\nEnsuring stability and memory efficiency is critical:\n- The Layer-Adaptive STate pruning (LAST) method for SSMs reduces the state dimension of each layer, minimizing model-level energy loss and bounding output distortion. This approach can help in maintaining stability and reducing unnecessary computational and memory costs.\n- Robustifying state-space models via approximate diagonalization, as proposed by Yu et al. (2023), can help in ensuring stability for long sequences, which is crucial when combining multiple adaptive components[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration and Design Considerations\nTo integrate these techniques effectively:\n- Balance state-free processing with adaptive mechanisms to ensure stability and efficiency.\n- Optimize memory access patterns for parallel processing of hierarchical structures.\n- Use transfer function parameterization to optimize memory usage and ensure stability when combining multiple adaptive components[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can design an autoregressive language model that leverages state-free inference, adaptive normalization, and efficient multi-stream processing, while ensuring stability and memory efficiency.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/30 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n# B\u2019MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory \n\nLuca Zancato* Arjun Seshadri Yonatan Dukler Aditya Golatkar Yantao Shen<br>Benjamin Bowman Matthew Trager Alessandro Achille Stefano Soatto\n\nAWS AI Labs\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nWe describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference.\n```\n\n#### 2. Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers for Near-Infinite Context (Avg.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Towards Effective Multi-Modal Interchanges in Zero-Resource Sounding Object Localization\n\n*From Search Query: stability multi-stream adaptive normalization*\n\n*Yang Zhao, Chen Zhang, Haifeng Huang, Haoyuan Li, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions, and develops an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of the model.\n\n**Abstract:** Aiming to locate the object that emits a specified sound in complex scenes, the task of sounding object localization bridges two perception-oriented modalities of vision and acoustics, and brings enormous research value to the comprehensive perceptual understanding of machine intelligence. Although there are massive training data collected in this field, few of them contain accurate bounding box annotations, hindering the learning process and further application of proposed models. In order to address this problem, we try to explore an effective multi-modal knowledge transfer strategy to obtain precise knowledge from other similar tasks and transfer it through well-aligned multi-modal data to deal with this task in a zero-resource manner. Concretely, we design and propose a novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions. The former is utilized to extract the knowledge related to referring object localization from the image grounding task, while the latter is devised to learn a universal semantic space shared between texts and audios. Moreover, we further develop an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of our model. The extensive experiments on various publicly-available benchmarks demonstrate that TURN can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches without using any data in this field, which verifies the feasibility of our proposed mechanisms and strategies.

Kersting, Taiji Suzuki, Brian Hie, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R'e, Ce Zhang, Stefano Massaroli*\n\n**TL;DR:** Results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. A Solver-Free Framework for Scalable Learning in Neural ILP Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state-free architectures*\n\n*Yatin Nandwani, R. Ranjan, Mausam, Parag Singla*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments on several problems, both perceptual as well as symbolic, which require learning the constraints of an ILP, show that this approach has superior performance and scales much better compared to purely neural baselines and other state-of-the-art models that require solver-based training.\n\n**Abstract:** There is a recent focus on designing architectures that have an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) layer within a neural model (referred to as Neural ILP in this paper). Neural ILP architectures are suitable for pure reasoning tasks that require data-driven constraint learning or for tasks requiring both perception (neural) and reasoning (ILP). A recent SOTA approach for end-to-end training of Neural ILP explicitly defines gradients through the ILP black box (Paulus et al. 2021) - this trains extremely slowly, owing to a call to the underlying ILP solver for every training data point in a minibatch. In response, we present an alternative training strategy that is solver-free, i.e., does not call the ILP solver at all at training time. Neural ILP has a set of trainable hyperplanes (for cost and constraints in ILP), together representing a polyhedron. Our key idea is that the training loss should impose that the final polyhedron separates the positives (all constraints satisfied) from the negatives (at least one violated constraint or a suboptimal cost value), via a soft-margin formulation. While positive example(s) are provided as part of the training data, we devise novel techniques for generating negative samples. Our solution is flexible enough to handle equality as well as inequality constraints. Experiments on several problems, both perceptual as well as symbolic, which require learning the constraints of an ILP, show that our approach has superior performance and scales much better compared to purely neural baselines and other state-of-the-art models that require solver-based training. In particular, we are able to obtain excellent performance in 9 x 9 symbolic and visual sudoku, to which the other Neural ILP solver is not able to scale.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. The No Free Lunch Theorem, Kolmogorov Complexity, and the Role of Inductive Biases in Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state-free architectures*\n\n*Micah Goldblum, Marc Finzi, K. Rowan, A. Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity, and it is explained how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** No free lunch theorems for supervised learning state that no learner can solve all problems or that all learners achieve exactly the same accuracy on average over a uniform distribution on learning problems. Accordingly, these theorems are often referenced in support of the notion that individual problems require specially tailored inductive biases. While virtually all uniformly sampled datasets have high complexity, real-world problems disproportionately generate low-complexity data, and we argue that neural network models share this same preference, formalized using Kolmogorov complexity. Notably, we show that architectures designed for a particular domain, such as computer vision, can compress datasets on a variety of seemingly unrelated domains. Our experiments show that pre-trained and even randomly initialized language models prefer to generate low-complexity sequences. Whereas no free lunch theorems seemingly indicate that individual problems require specialized learners, we explain how tasks that often require human intervention such as picking an appropriately sized model when labeled data is scarce or plentiful can be automated into a single learning algorithm. These observations justify the trend in deep learning of unifying seemingly disparate problems with an increasingly small set of machine learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. New Insights for the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Online Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: stability multi-stream adaptive normalization*\n\n*Sungroh Yoon, Ho Bae, Hyemi Jang, Sunwon Hong, Dongjin Lee, Dahuin Jung*\n\n**Abstract:** The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.

This is partially attributed to the fact that\ncomprehensive \"in-the-wild\" benchmarks have been developed for face detection,\nlandmark localisation and recognition/verification. A very important technology\nthat has not been thoroughly evaluated yet is deformable face tracking\n\"in-the-wild\". Until now, the performance has mainly been assessed\nqualitatively by visually assessing the result of a deformable face tracking\ntechnology on short videos. In this paper, we perform the first, to the best of\nour knowledge, thorough evaluation of state-of-the-art deformable face tracking\npipelines using the recently introduced 300VW benchmark. We evaluate many\ndifferent architectures focusing mainly on the task of on-line deformable face\ntracking.

HESSO: Towards Automatic Efficient and User Friendly Any Neural Network Training and Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid state-free architectures*\n\n*Luming Liang, Ilya Zharkov, Vladimir Lyapunov, Yong Ma, Tianyu Ding, Jongwoo Ko, Colby Banbury, David Aponte, Xiaoyi Qu, Tianyi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning is one of the most popular approaches to effectively compress the heavy deep neural networks (DNNs) into compact sub-networks while retaining performance. The existing methods suffer from multi-stage procedures along with significant engineering efforts and human expertise. The Only-Train-Once (OTO) series has been recently proposed to resolve the many pain points by streamlining the workflow by automatically conducting (i) search space generation, (ii) structured sparse optimization, and (iii) sub-network construction. However, the built-in sparse optimizers in the OTO series, i.e., the Half-Space Projected Gradient (HSPG) family, have limitations that require hyper-parameter tuning and the implicit controls of the sparsity exploration, consequently requires intervening by human expertise. To address such limitations, we propose a Hybrid Efficient Structured Sparse Optimizer (HESSO). HESSO could automatically and efficiently train a DNN to produce a high-performing subnetwork. Meanwhile, it is almost tuning-free and enjoys user-friendly integration for generic training applications. To address another common issue of irreversible performance collapse observed in pruning DNNs, we further propose a Corrective Redundant Identification Cycle (CRIC) for reliably identifying indispensable structures. We numerically demonstrate the efficacy of HESSO and its enhanced version HESSO-CRIC on a variety of applications ranging from computer vision to natural language processing, including large language model. The numerical results showcase that HESSO can achieve competitive even superior performance to varying state-of-the-arts and support most DNN architectures. Meanwhile, CRIC can effectively prevent the irreversible performance collapse and further enhance the performance of HESSO on certain applications.

This approach accelerates learning, reduces the number of training steps, and enhances model stability by interpreting matrix-vector multiplications as dot products signifying cosine similarities.\n\n## Multi-Stream Processing\n- **Multi-Stream Fusion Framework**: While not directly applied to language models, the concept of multi-stream fusion can be adapted. For instance, using multiple streams to process different scales or aspects of the input data can be beneficial. This approach can be integrated with adaptive normalization to handle various scales in parallel, similar to how it is used in image quality assessment models.\n\n## State-Free Inference and Memory Optimization\n- **State-Free Inference of State-Space Models**: This technique can be adapted to reduce memory overhead in autoregressive models by avoiding the need to store large state vectors. State-free inference algorithms can be highly efficient and do not incur significant memory or computational costs with an increase in state size (Analysis Note).\n\n## Hybrid Architectures\n- **B'MOJO**: This framework combines the benefits of state-space models and Transformers, offering high expressivity and recall while maintaining computational efficiency. Integrating such hybrid architectures with state-free inference and adaptive normalization can provide a balanced approach to stability, efficiency, and expressiveness (Analysis Note).\n\n## Stability and Efficiency\n- **Normalization Techniques**: Using normalization techniques such as Instance Normalization (IN) instead of Batch Normalization (BN) can improve stability, especially when dealing with smaller batch sizes or high variance between instances. IN normalizes each instance independently, which can be more suitable for tasks requiring robustness to variant inputs.\n\n## Integration Strategies\n- **Adaptive Layer Norm**: This approach computes the scaling and shifting parameters (\\(\\gamma, \\beta\\)) from other data, such as conditioning information processed by an MLP. This can be integrated into a hybrid architecture to ensure that the normalization is adaptive and context-dependent, enhancing stability and performance.\n\n## Memory Optimization\n- **Transfer Function Parameterization**: This method enables efficient memory usage by parameterizing transfer functions instead of storing large state vectors. This can be particularly useful in hybrid architectures where memory efficiency is crucial (Analysis Note).\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Normalize Vectors on Hypersphere**: Normalizing all vectors to unit norm, as in the nGPT architecture, can enhance stability and accelerate learning.\n2. **State-Free Inference**: Implementing state-free inference algorithms can reduce memory overhead and improve computational efficiency.\n3. **Multi-Stream Processing**: Using multiple streams to handle different scales or aspects of the input data in parallel can enhance performance and efficiency.\n4. **Adaptive Normalization**: Integrating adaptive normalization techniques, such as adaptive layer norm, can ensure that the model adapts to the context and maintains stability.\n5. **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining the strengths of different architectures, such as state-space models and Transformers, can provide a balanced approach to expressiveness, stability, and computational efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop a robust and efficient autoregressive language model that leverages state-free inference, adaptive normalization, and multi-stream processing to achieve better overall performance.\n",

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.07)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 50  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework is derived, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear time-invariant state space models (SSM) are a classical model from engineering and statistics, that have recently been shown to be very promising in machine learning through the Structured State Space sequence model (S4). A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

Transition-constant Normalization for Image Enhancement\n\n*From Search Query: normalization techniques hybrid architectures*\n\n*Jie Huang, Man Zhou, Jinghao Zhang, Gang Yang, Mingde Yao, Chongyi Li, Zhiwei Xiong, Fengmei Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN), which consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalization techniques that capture image style by statistical representation have become a popular component in deep neural networks. Although image enhancement can be considered as a form of style transformation, there has been little exploration of how normalization affect the enhancement performance. To fully leverage the potential of normalization, we present a novel Transition-Constant Normalization (TCN) for various image enhancement tasks. Specifically, it consists of two streams of normalization operations arranged under an invertible constraint, along with a feature sub-sampling operation that satisfies the normalization constraint. TCN enjoys several merits, including being parameter-free, plug-and-play, and incurring no additional computational costs. We provide various formats to utilize TCN for image enhancement, including seamless integration with enhancement networks, incorporation into encoder-decoder architectures for downsampling, and implementation of efficient architectures. Through extensive experiments on multiple image enhancement tasks, like low-light enhancement, exposure correction, SDR2HDR translation, and image dehazing, our TCN consistently demonstrates performance improvements. Besides, it showcases extensive ability in other tasks including pan-sharpening and medical segmentation.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: normalization techniques hybrid architectures*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks.

Jordan*\n\n**TL;DR:** TransNorm is an end-to-end trainable layer to make DNNs more transferable across domains and can be easily applied to various deep neural networks and domain adaption methods, without introducing any extra hyper-parameters or learnable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) excel at learning representations when trained on large-scale datasets. Pre-trained DNNs also show strong transferability when fine-tuned to other labeled datasets. However, such transferability becomes weak when the target dataset is fully unlabeled as in Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA). We envision that the loss of transferability may stem from the intrinsic limitation of the architecture design of DNNs. In this paper, we delve into the components of DNN architectures and propose Transferable Normalization (TransNorm) in place of existing normalization techniques. TransNorm is an end-to-end trainable layer to make DNNs more transferable across domains. As a general method, TransNorm can be easily applied to various deep neural networks and domain adaption methods, without introducing any extra hyper-parameters or learnable parameters. Empirical results justify that TransNorm not only improves classification accuracies but also accelerates convergence for mainstream DNN-based domain adaptation methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 188  (*Influential: 27*)\n\n#### 4.

Experiment results show that the model built on pre-trained TableVLM can improve the performance up to 1.97% in tree-editing-distance-score on ComplexTable.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Three-Way Trade-Off in Multi-Objective Learning: Optimization, Generalization and Conflict-Avoidance\n\n*From Search Query: training stability multi-stream processing*\n\n*Lisha Chen, H. Fernando, Yiming Ying, Tianyi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work focuses on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the Multi-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and studies the generalization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its interplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-objective learning (MOL) problems often arise in emerging machine learning problems when there are multiple learning criteria, data modalities, or learning tasks. Different from single-objective learning, one of the critical challenges in MOL is the potential conflict among different objectives during the iterative optimization process. Recent works have developed various dynamic weighting algorithms for MOL such as MGDA and its variants, where the central idea is to find an update direction that avoids conflicts among objectives. Albeit its appealing intuition, empirical studies show that dynamic weighting methods may not always outperform static ones. To understand this theory-practical gap, we focus on a new stochastic variant of MGDA - the Multi-objective gradient with Double sampling (MoDo) algorithm, and study the generalization performance of the dynamic weighting-based MoDo and its interplay with optimization through the lens of algorithm stability. Perhaps surprisingly, we find that the key rationale behind MGDA -- updating along conflict-avoidant direction - may hinder dynamic weighting algorithms from achieving the optimal ${\\cal O}(1/\\sqrt{n})$ population risk, where $n$ is the number of training samples. We further demonstrate the impact of the variability of dynamic weights on the three-way trade-off among optimization, generalization, and conflict avoidance that is unique in MOL. We showcase the generality of our theoretical framework by analyzing other existing stochastic MOL algorithms under the framework. Experiments on various multi-task learning benchmarks are performed to demonstrate the practical applicability.

Towards Effective Multi-Modal Interchanges in Zero-Resource Sounding Object Localization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability multi-stream processing*\n\n*Yang Zhao, Chen Zhang, Haifeng Huang, Haoyuan Li, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions, and develops an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of the model.\n\n**Abstract:** Aiming to locate the object that emits a specified sound in complex scenes, the task of sounding object localization bridges two perception-oriented modalities of vision and acoustics, and brings enormous research value to the comprehensive perceptual understanding of machine intelligence. Although there are massive training data collected in this field, few of them contain accurate bounding box annotations, hindering the learning process and further application of proposed models. In order to address this problem, we try to explore an effective multi-modal knowledge transfer strategy to obtain precise knowledge from other similar tasks and transfer it through well-aligned multi-modal data to deal with this task in a zero-resource manner. Concretely, we design and propose a novel Two-stream Universal Referring localization Network (TURN), which is composed of a localization stream and an alignment stream to carry out different functions. The former is utilized to extract the knowledge related to referring object localization from the image grounding task, while the latter is devised to learn a universal semantic space shared between texts and audios. Moreover, we further develop an adaptive sampling strategy to automatically identify the overlap between different data domains, thus boosting the performance and stability of our model. The extensive experiments on various publicly-available benchmarks demonstrate that TURN can achieve competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art approaches without using any data in this field, which verifies the feasibility of our proposed mechanisms and strategies.

Our method can be used to optimize through any differentiable feature matching loss to achieve a target (stylized) output and leverages gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency. We demonstrate a surprisingly wide-range of applications for music generation including inpainting, outpainting, and looping as well as intensity, melody, and musical structure control - all without ever fine-tuning the underlying model.

Using a single unified internal representation for translation forests, the decoder strictly separates model-specific translation logic from general rescoring, pruning, and inference algorithms. From this unified representation, the decoder can extract not only the 1or k-best translations, but also alignments to a reference, or the quantities necessary to drive discriminative training using gradient-based or gradient-free optimization techniques.

Bidirectional Learning for Robust Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: normalization techniques hybrid architectures*\n\n*Sidney Pontes-Filho, Marcus Liwicki*\n\n**Abstract:** A multilayer perceptron can behave as a generative classifier by applying\nbidirectional learning (BL). It consists of training an undirected neural\nnetwork to map input to output and vice-versa; therefore it can produce a\nclassifier in one direction, and a generator in the opposite direction for the\nsame data. The learning process of BL tries to reproduce the neuroplasticity\nstated in Hebbian theory using only backward propagation of errors. In this\npaper, two novel learning techniques are introduced which use BL for improving\nrobustness to white noise static and adversarial examples. The first method is\nbidirectional propagation of errors, which the error propagation occurs in\nbackward and forward directions. Motivated by the fact that its generative\nmodel receives as input a constant vector per class, we introduce as a second\nmethod the hybrid adversarial networks (HAN). Its generative model receives a\nrandom vector as input and its training is based on generative adversarial\nnetworks (GAN). To assess the performance of BL, we perform experiments using\nseveral architectures with fully and convolutional layers, with and without\nbias. Experimental results show that both methods improve robustness to white\nnoise static and adversarial examples, and even increase accuracy, but have\ndifferent behavior depending on the architecture and task, being more\nbeneficial to use the one or the other. Nevertheless, HAN using a convolutional\narchitecture with batch normalization presents outstanding robustness, reaching\nstate-of-the-art accuracy on adversarial examples of hand-written digits.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. ClaPIM: Scalable Sequence CLAssification using Processing-In-Memory\n\n*From Search Query: normalization techniques hybrid architectures*\n\n*Shahar Kvatinsky, Leonid Yavits, Ben Perach, Robert Hanhan, Orian Leitersdorf, Barak Hoffer, Marcel Khalifa*\n\n**Abstract:** DNA sequence classification is a fundamental task in computational biology with vast implications for applications such as disease prevention and drug design. Therefore, fast high-quality sequence classifiers are significantly important. This paper introduces ClaPIM, a scalable DNA sequence classification architecture based on the emerging concept of hybrid in-crossbar and near-crossbar memristive processing-in-memory (PIM). We enable efficient and high-quality classification by uniting the filter and search stages within a single algorithm. Specifically, we propose a custom filtering technique that drastically narrows the search space and a search approach that facilitates approximate string matching through a distance function. ClaPIM is the first PIM architecture for scalable approximate string matching that benefits from the high density of memristive crossbar arrays and the massive computational parallelism of PIM. Compared with Kraken2, a state-of-the-art software classifier, ClaPIM provides significantly higher classification quality (up to 20x improvement in F1 score) and also demonstrates a 1.8x throughput improvement. Compared with EDAM, a recently-proposed SRAM-based accelerator that is restricted to small datasets, we observe both a 30.4x improvement in normalized throughput per area and a 7% increase in classification precision.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. An attention-based backend allowing efficient fine-tuning of transformer models for speaker verification\n\n*From Search Query: training stability multi-stream processing*\n\n*Jan Cernocky, Lukas Burget, Ladislav Mosner, Themos Stafylakis, Oldrich Plchot, Junyi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, self-supervised learning paradigm has received extensive attention due to its great success in various down-stream tasks. However, the fine-tuning strategies for adapting those pre-trained models to speaker verification task have yet to be fully explored. In this paper, we analyze several feature extraction approaches built on top of a pre-trained model, as well as regularization and learning rate schedule to stabilize the fine-tuning process and further boost performance: multi-head factorized attentive pooling is proposed to factorize the comparison of speaker representations into multiple phonetic clusters. We regularize towards the parameters of the pre-trained model and we set different learning rates for each layer of the pre-trained model during fine-tuning. The experimental results show our method can significantly shorten the training time to 4 hours and achieve SOTA performance: 0.59%, 0.79% and 1.77% EER on Vox1-O, Vox1-E and Vox1-H, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization state-free inference*\n\n*Jason K. Eshraghian, Peng Zhou, Dustin Richmond, Yiqiao Wang, Tyler Sheaves, Ethan Sifferman, Yu Zhang, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 5. SSAMBA: Self-Supervised Audio Representation Learning with Mamba State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization state-free inference*\n\n*Nima Mesgarani, Xilin Jiang, Sukru Samet Dindar, Siavash Shams*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have revolutionized deep learning across various tasks, including audio representation learning, due to their powerful modeling capabilities. However, they often suffer from quadratic complexity in both GPU memory usage and computational inference time, affecting their efficiency. Recently, state space models (SSMs) like Mamba have emerged as a promising alternative, offering a more efficient approach by avoiding these complexities. Given these advantages, we explore the potential of SSM-based models in audio tasks. In this paper, we introduce Self-Supervised Audio Mamba (SSAMBA), the first self-supervised, attention-free, and SSM-based model for audio representation learning. SSAMBA leverages the bidirectional Mamba to capture complex audio patterns effectively. We incorporate a self-supervised pretraining framework that optimizes both discriminative and generative objectives, enabling the model to learn robust audio representations from large-scale, unlabeled datasets. We evaluated SSAMBA on various tasks such as audio classification, keyword spotting, and speaker identification. Our results demonstrate that SSAMBA outperforms the Self-Supervised Audio Spectrogram Transformer (SSAST) in most tasks. Notably, SSAMBA is approximately 92.7% faster in batch inference speed and 95.4% more memory-efficient than SSAST for the tiny model size with an input token size of 22k. These efficiency gains, combined with superior performance, underscore the effectiveness of SSAMBA's architectural innovation, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of audio processing applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, especially focusing on hybrid architectures, normalization techniques, training stability, memory optimization, and state-free inference, here are some key points and potential directions based on the provided context and search results:\n\n## Normalization Techniques for Hybrid Architectures\nWhile the provided search results do not directly address normalization techniques for hybrid neural architectures, it is crucial to consider how different normalization methods can be integrated into hybrid models. Here are some general insights:\n\n- **Layer Normalization and Batch Normalization**: These are common techniques used in neural networks. For hybrid architectures, layer normalization is often preferred because it does not depend on the batch size, which can be beneficial in multi-stream processing and state-free inference.\n- **Instance Normalization**: This can be particularly useful in models that combine different types of layers (e.g., CNN and Transformer layers), as it normalizes each instance separately, which can help in stabilizing the training process.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis for Multi-Stream Processing Systems\nTraining stability in multi-stream processing systems is critical. Here are some considerations:\n\n- **Synchronization Overhead**: Ensuring that different streams are synchronized properly can be challenging. Techniques like asynchronous training or using buffers to manage the flow of data between streams can help maintain stability.\n- **Gradient Clipping and Weight Decay**: These techniques can help stabilize the training process by preventing exploding gradients and overfitting, respectively.\n- **Ablation Studies**: Conducting ablation studies, as seen in the recommendation method based on hybrid neural networks, can help identify which components of the multi-stream system contribute most to instability and optimize accordingly.\n\n## Memory Optimization Methods for State-Free Inference\nMemory optimization is vital for state-free inference:\n\n- **MatMul-Free Models**: As mentioned in the analysis, MatMul-free models can achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers while requiring less memory during inference. This approach can be particularly beneficial for state-free inference.\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Algorithms like FlashAttention that reduce memory reads/writes can significantly optimize memory access patterns, which is crucial for multi-stream processing and state-free inference.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Different Normalization Approaches\nCombining different normalization approaches can enhance the robustness and performance of hybrid models:\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization**: Using layer normalization within each stream and batch normalization across streams can help balance the normalization process.\n- **Dynamic Normalization**: Implementing dynamic normalization techniques that adapt to the input data can be beneficial in hybrid architectures where different types of data may be processed.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Hybrid Normalization Techniques\nEvaluating the performance of hybrid normalization techniques involves several aspects:\n\n- **Empirical Results**: Conducting experiments similar to those in the recommendation method based on hybrid neural networks, where different normalization techniques are compared, can provide empirical evidence of their effectiveness.\n- **System-Level Improvements**: As seen in the H4H-NAS framework, co-designing the model and system architecture can lead to significant improvements in performance and efficiency. This approach can be applied to evaluate the impact of different normalization techniques on the overall system performance.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Leveraging architectural heterogeneity, such as using NPUs and CIMs, can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of hybrid models, as demonstrated in the H4H-NAS framework.\n- **Mechanistic Design**: Designing hybrid architectures from a variety of computational primitives, as suggested by Poli et al., can outperform standard architectures and should be considered when integrating different normalization techniques and optimizing memory access patterns.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more robust, efficient, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of hybrid architectures and advanced normalization techniques.\n",

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference normalization language models*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

Label-free Node Classification on Graphs with Large Language Models (LLMS)\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference normalization language models*\n\n*Zhikai Chen, Haitao Mao, Hongzhi Wen, Haoyu Han, Wei-dong Jin, Haiyang Zhang, Hui Liu, Jiliang Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a label-free node classification on graphs with LLMs pipeline, LLM-GNN, which amalgamates the strengths of both GNNs and LLMs while mitigating their limitations while leveraging the confidence scores derived from LLMs to advanced node selection.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, there have been remarkable advancements in node classification achieved by Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). However, they necessitate abundant high-quality labels to ensure promising performance. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive zero-shot proficiency on text-attributed graphs. Yet, they face challenges in efficiently processing structural data and suffer from high inference costs. In light of these observations, this work introduces a label-free node classification on graphs with LLMs pipeline, LLM-GNN. It amalgamates the strengths of both GNNs and LLMs while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, LLMs are leveraged to annotate a small portion of nodes and then GNNs are trained on LLMs' annotations to make predictions for the remaining large portion of nodes. The implementation of LLM-GNN faces a unique challenge: how can we actively select nodes for LLMs to annotate and consequently enhance the GNN training? How can we leverage LLMs to obtain annotations of high quality, representativeness, and diversity, thereby enhancing GNN performance with less cost? To tackle this challenge, we develop an annotation quality heuristic and leverage the confidence scores derived from LLMs to advanced node selection. Comprehensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of LLM-GNN. In particular, LLM-GNN can achieve an accuracy of 74.9% on a vast-scale dataset \\products with a cost less than 1 dollar.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

Maire*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops an approach to efficiently grow neural networks, within which parameterization and optimization strategies are designed by considering their effects on the training dynamics by proposing a learning rate adaption mechanism that rebalances the gradient contribution of these separate subcomponents.\n\n**Abstract:** We develop an approach to efficiently grow neural networks, within which parameterization and optimization strategies are designed by considering their effects on the training dynamics. Unlike existing growing methods, which follow simple replication heuristics or utilize auxiliary gradient-based local optimization, we craft a parameterization scheme which dynamically stabilizes weight, activation, and gradient scaling as the architecture evolves, and maintains the inference functionality of the network. To address the optimization difficulty resulting from imbalanced training effort distributed to subnetworks fading in at different growth phases, we propose a learning rate adaption mechanism that rebalances the gradient contribution of these separate subcomponents. Experimental results show that our method achieves comparable or better accuracy than training large fixed-size models, while saving a substantial portion of the original computation budget for training. We demonstrate that these gains translate into real wall-clock training speedups.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Transformed Low-Rank Parameterization Can Help Robust Generalization for Tensor Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: transfer function parameterization neural networks*\n\n*Andong Wang, C. Li, Mingyuan Bai, Zhong Jin, Guoxu Zhou, Qianchuan Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper is the first to answer the question of how t-SVD theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization error of both standard and adversarially trained t-RNs and indicates that the transformed low-rank parameterization can promisingly enhance robust generalization for t-nns.\n\n**Abstract:** Achieving efficient and robust multi-channel data learning is a challenging task in data science. By exploiting low-rankness in the transformed domain, i.e., transformed low-rankness, tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) has achieved extensive success in multi-channel data representation and has recently been extended to function representation such as Neural Networks with t-product layers (t-NNs). However, it still remains unclear how t-SVD theoretically affects the learning behavior of t-NNs. This paper is the first to answer this question by deriving the upper bounds of the generalization error of both standard and adversarially trained t-NNs. It reveals that the t-NNs compressed by exact transformed low-rank parameterization can achieve a sharper adversarial generalization bound. In practice, although t-NNs rarely have exactly transformed low-rank weights, our analysis further shows that by adversarial training with gradient flow (GF), the over-parameterized t-NNs with ReLU activations are trained with implicit regularization towards transformed low-rank parameterization under certain conditions. We also establish adversarial generalization bounds for t-NNs with approximately transformed low-rank weights. Our analysis indicates that the transformed low-rank parameterization can promisingly enhance robust generalization for t-NNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

While Gaussian processes elegantly tackle these problems, they struggle with scalability and handling rich inputs, such as images. To address these issues, we introduce a technique that converts neural networks from weight space to function space, through a dual parameterization. Our parameterization offers: (i) a way to scale function-space methods to large data sets via sparsification, (ii) retention of prior knowledge when access to past data is limited, and (iii) a mechanism to incorporate new data without retraining. Our experiments demonstrate that we can retain knowledge in continual learning and incorporate new data efficiently. We further show its strengths in uncertainty quantification and guiding exploration in model-based RL.

Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream adaptive normalization*\n\n*Dong Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, S. Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) is proposed, a new TTS model which aligns gain and bias of the text input according to the style extracted from a reference speech audio which effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even from single speech audio.\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized speech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical applicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few audio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However, existing methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low adaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a new TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also effectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive Layer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input according to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our model effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even from single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to speech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two discriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training. The experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech which accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3 sec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 131  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n#### 8.

However, RL-trained policies often suffer from the action \ufb02uctuation problem, where the consecutive actions signi\ufb01cantly differ despite only slight state variations. This problem results in mechanical components\u2019 wear and tear and poses safety hazards. The action \ufb02uctuation is caused by the high Lipschitz constant of actor networks. To address this problem, we pro-pose a neural network named LipsNet. We pro-pose the Multi-dimensional Gradient Normalization (MGN) method, to constrain the Lipschitz constant of networks with multi-dimensional input and output. Bene\ufb01ting from MGN, LipsNet achieves Lipschitz continuity, allowing smooth actions while preserving control performance by adjusting Lipschitz constant. LipsNet addresses the action \ufb02uctuation problem at network level rather than algorithm level, which can serve as actor networks in most RL algorithms, making it more \ufb02exible and user-friendly than previous works. Experiments demonstrate that LipsNet has good landscape smoothness and noise robustness, resulting in signi\ufb01cantly smoother action compared to the Multilayer Perceptron.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards Multi-spatiotemporal-scale Generalized PDE Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: transfer function parameterization neural networks*\n\n*Johannes Brandstetter, Jayesh K. Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Partial differential equations (PDEs) are central to describing complex physical system simulations. Their expensive solution techniques have led to an increased interest in deep neural network based surrogates. However, the practical utility of training such surrogates is contingent on their ability to model complex multi-scale spatio-temporal phenomena. Various neural network architectures have been proposed to target such phenomena, most notably Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs), which give a natural handle over local & global spatial information via parameterization of different Fourier modes, and U-Nets which treat local and global information via downsampling and upsampling paths. However, generalizing across different equation parameters or time-scales still remains a challenge. In this work, we make a comprehensive comparison between various FNO, ResNet, and U-Net like approaches to fluid mechanics problems in both vorticity-stream and velocity function form. For U-Nets, we transfer recent architectural improvements from computer vision, most notably from object segmentation and generative modeling. We further analyze the design considerations for using FNO layers to improve performance of U-Net architectures without major degradation of computational cost. Finally, we show promising results on generalization to different PDE parameters and time-scales with a single surrogate model.

HOUDINI: Lifelong Learning as Program Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: transfer function parameterization neural networks*\n\n*Dipak Chaudhari, Charles Sutton, Akash Srivastava, Swarat Chaudhuri, Lazar Valkov*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a neurosymbolic framework for the lifelong learning of algorithmic\ntasks that mix perception and procedural reasoning. Reusing high-level concepts\nacross domains and learning complex procedures are key challenges in lifelong\nlearning. We show that a program synthesis approach that combines gradient\ndescent with combinatorial search over programs can be a more effective\nresponse to these challenges than purely neural methods. Our framework, called\nHOUDINI, represents neural networks as strongly typed, differentiable\nfunctional programs that use symbolic higher-order combinators to compose a\nlibrary of neural functions. Our learning algorithm consists of: (1) a symbolic\nprogram synthesizer that performs a type-directed search over parameterized\nprograms, and decides on the library functions to reuse, and the architectures\nto combine them, while learning a sequence of tasks; and (2) a neural module\nthat trains these programs using stochastic gradient descent. We evaluate\nHOUDINI on three benchmarks that combine perception with the algorithmic tasks\nof counting, summing, and shortest-path computation. Our experiments show that\nHOUDINI transfers high-level concepts more effectively than traditional\ntransfer learning and progressive neural networks, and that the typed\nrepresentation of networks significantly accelerates the search.\n\n**Conference:** houdini-lifelong-learning-as-program-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 3.

The DVG contains motion and content streams that learn from the motion vector and the single image respectively, as well as an encoder and a decoder to learn shared content features and construct video frames with corresponding motion respectively. Specifically, the \\emph{motion stream} introduces multiple \\emph{adaptive instance normalization} (AdaIN) layers to integrate multi-level motion information that are processed by linear layers. In the testing stage, videos with the same content but various motion information can be generated by different \\emph{normalized motion vectors} based on only one input image. We further conduct experiments on Sky Time-lapse dataset, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art methods for generating high-quality and dynamic videos, as well as the variety for generating videos with various motion information.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Query-Centric Trajectory Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream adaptive normalization*\n\n*Yu-Kai Huang, Yung-Hui Li, JianPing Wang, Zikang Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Predicting the future trajectories of surrounding agents is essential for autonomous vehicles to operate safely. This paper presents QCNet, a modeling framework toward pushing the boundaries of trajectory prediction. First, we identify that the agent-centric modeling scheme used by existing approaches requires re-normalizing and re-encoding the input whenever the observation window slides forward, leading to redundant computations during online prediction. To overcome this limitation and achieve faster inference, we introduce a query-centric paradigm for scene encoding, which enables the reuse of past computations by learning representations independent of the global spacetime coordinate system. Sharing the invariant scene features among all target agents further allows the parallelism of multi-agent trajectory decoding. Second, even given rich encodings of the scene, existing decoding strategies struggle to capture the multimodality inherent in agents' future behavior, especially when the prediction horizon is long. To tackle this challenge, we first employ anchor-free queries to generate trajectory proposals in a recurrent fashion, which allows the model to utilize different scene contexts when decoding waypoints at different horizons. A refinement module then takes the trajectory proposals as anchors and leverages anchor-based queries to refine the trajectories further. By supplying adaptive and high-quality anchors to the refinement module, our query-based decoder can better deal with the multimodality in the output of trajectory prediction. Our approach ranks 1st on Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 motion forecasting benchmarks, outperforming all methods on all main metrics by a large margin. Meanwhile, our model can achieve streaming scene encoding and parallel multi-agent decoding thanks to the query-centric design ethos.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on the aspects outlined in the analysis of the StateAdaptiveNorm-GPT proposal, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## State-Free Inference Techniques in Normalization Layers\n\n- The concept of state-free inference is crucial for memory efficiency. A recent approach discussed in the context of State Space Models (SSMs) involves using transfer function parameterization. For instance, the paper on \"State-Free Inference of State-Space Models: The Transfer Function Approach\" (though not directly cited in the sources), aligns with the idea of using transfer functions to manage state-free inference, which can be applied to normalization layers for better memory management.\n\n## Transfer Function Parameterization for Memory Efficiency\n\n- Transfer function parameterization can be seen as a method to manage memory efficiently by decoupling the parameter count from the computational footprint. This is similar to the concept of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, which apply conditional computation to reduce the computational load. The paper on \"Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models\" touches on conditional computation and its benefits in reducing memory and computation requirements, although it does not specifically discuss transfer functions. However, the principle of conditional computation can be extended to transfer function parameterization for memory efficiency.\n\n## Multi-Stream Processing in Language Model Architectures\n\n- Multi-stream processing can be beneficial for parallelization and efficiency. The Taipan model, which combines State Space Models (SSMs) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs), demonstrates a hybrid architecture that can handle long-context sequences efficiently. While Taipan does not explicitly discuss multi-stream processing, its hybrid architecture shows how different components can be integrated to improve performance and efficiency. This can serve as a foundation for exploring multi-stream adaptive normalization.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Normalization Layers\n\n- Memory optimization is a critical aspect, and techniques like activation sparsity can be highly effective. The TEAL method described in \"Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models\" achieves significant sparsity in hidden states, reducing compute and memory requirements. This approach can be adapted to normalization layers to optimize memory usage.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining Different Normalization Approaches\n\n- Hybrid architectures, such as the Taipan model, combine the efficiency of State Space Models with the performance of Transformer-like models. This approach can be extended to combine different normalization techniques. For example, integrating adaptive normalization with hierarchical normalization, as proposed in the StateAdaptiveNorm-GPT, can leverage the strengths of both methods. The B'MOJO architecture, which combines state space realizations with eidetic and fading memory, provides another example of how hybrid architectures can be designed for improved performance and efficiency.\n\n### Additional Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **State-Free Inference and Transfer Functions**: Investigate papers that specifically focus on state-free inference techniques and transfer function parameterization. The work on SSMs and MoE models can provide valuable insights into how these techniques can be applied to normalization layers.\n  \n- **Multi-Stream Processing**: Research on parallel processing in deep learning models can provide guidance on how to implement multi-stream adaptive normalization. Papers on distributed computing and parallel architectures in deep learning can be particularly useful.\n\n- **Memory Optimization**: Activation sparsity and other sparsity techniques are promising for memory optimization. Further research on these methods and their application to normalization layers can help in achieving better memory-computation trade-offs.\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Studying recent advances in hybrid architectures, such as Taipan and B'MOJO, can help in designing more efficient and effective normalization approaches. The integration of different normalization techniques and the use of selective attention layers can be key areas to explore.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and exploring recent research in these areas, the researcher can develop a more efficient, scalable, and high-performance autoregressive language model.\n",

We propose Hawk, an RNN with gated linear recurrences, and Griffin, a hybrid model that mixes gated linear recurrences with local attention. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks, while Griffin matches the performance of Llama-2 despite being trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. We also show that Griffin can extrapolate on sequences significantly longer than those seen during training. Our models match the hardware efficiency of Transformers during training, and during inference they have lower latency and significantly higher throughput. We scale Griffin up to 14B parameters, and explain how to shard our models for efficient distributed training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/56 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.08144, 2016.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/63 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nE. Hinton.

Score: 0.17)\n\n*Jean-Pierre Mercat, Igor Vasiljevic, Sedrick Scott Keh, Kushal Arora, Achal Dave, Adrien Gaidon, Thomas Kollar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA), a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget, and finds that the linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but it is identified persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear transformers have emerged as a subquadratic-time alternative to softmax attention and have garnered significant interest due to their fixed-size recurrent state that lowers inference cost. However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

HybridBERT - Making BERT Pretraining More Efficient Through Hybrid Mixture of Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid normalization architectures language models*\n\n*Gokul Srinivasagan, Simon Ostermann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization, and shows that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained transformer-based language models have produced state-of-the-art performance in most natural language understanding tasks. These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference. Moreover, we study the effect of weight initialization with a limited pretraining budget.

To interpret the Transformer-based models, their attention patterns have been extensively analyzed. However, the Transformer architecture is not only composed of the multi-head attention; other components can also contribute to Transformers\u2019 progressive performance. In this study, we extended the scope of the analysis of Transformers from solely the attention patterns to the whole attention block, i.e., multi-head attention, residual connection, and layer normalization. Our analysis of Transformer-based masked language models shows that the token-to-token interaction performed via attention has less impact on the intermediate representations than previously assumed. These results provide new intuitive explanations of existing reports; for example, discarding the learned attention patterns tends not to adversely affect the performance.

LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid normalization architectures language models*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization normalization layers*\n\n*Ji Lin, Ligeng Zhu, Wei-Ming Chen, Wei-Chen Wang, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW.\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization normalization layers*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Optimization Theory for ReLU Neural Networks Trained with Normalization Layers\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization normalization layers*\n\n*Yonatan Dukler, Quanquan Gu, Guido Mont\u00fafar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper gives the first global convergence result for two-layer neural networks with ReLU activations trained with a normalization layer, namely Weight Normalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Author(s): Dukler, Yonatan; Gu, Quanquan; Montufar, Guido | Abstract: The success of deep neural networks is in part due to the use of normalization layers. Normalization layers like Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization and Weight Normalization are ubiquitous in practice, as they improve generalization performance and speed up training significantly. Nonetheless, the vast majority of current deep learning theory and non-convex optimization literature focuses on the un-normalized setting, where the functions under consideration do not exhibit the properties of commonly normalized neural networks. In this paper, we bridge this gap by giving the first global convergence result for two-layer neural networks with ReLU activations trained with a normalization layer, namely Weight Normalization. Our analysis shows how the introduction of normalization layers changes the optimization landscape and can enable faster convergence as compared with un-normalized neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. Event Stream GPT: A Data Pre-processing and Modeling Library for Generative, Pre-trained Transformers over Continuous-time Sequences of Complex Events\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream processing transformers*\n\n*Matthew B. A. McDermott, Bret A. Nestor, Peniel Argaw, I. Kohane*\n\n**TL;DR:** ESGPT is introduced, an open-source library designed to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs for continuous-time event sequences, and allows users to build flexible, foundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimal configuration file.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative, pre-trained transformers (GPTs, a.k.a.\"Foundation Models\") have reshaped natural language processing (NLP) through their versatility in diverse downstream tasks. However, their potential extends far beyond NLP. This paper provides a software utility to help realize this potential, extending the applicability of GPTs to continuous-time sequences of complex events with internal dependencies, such as medical record datasets. Despite their potential, the adoption of foundation models in these domains has been hampered by the lack of suitable tools for model construction and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Event Stream GPT (ESGPT), an open-source library designed to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs for continuous-time event sequences. ESGPT allows users to (1) build flexible, foundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimal configuration file, (2) leverage a Hugging Face compatible modeling API for GPTs over this modality that incorporates intra-event causal dependency structures and autoregressive generation capabilities, and (3) evaluate models via standardized processes that can assess few and even zero-shot performance of pre-trained models on user-specified fine-tuning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 8. CascadeXML: Rethinking Transformers for End-to-end Multi-resolution Training in Extreme Multi-label Classification\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream processing transformers*\n\n*Siddhant Kharbanda, Atmadeep Banerjee, Erik Schultheis, Rohit Babbar*\n\n**TL;DR:** CascadeXML is proposed, an end-to-end multi-resolution learning pipeline, which can harness the multi-layered architecture of a transformer model for attending to different label resolutions with separate feature representations.\n\n**Abstract:** Extreme Multi-label Text Classification (XMC) involves learning a classifier that can assign an input with a subset of most relevant labels from millions of label choices. Recent approaches, such as XR-Transformer and LightXML, leverage a transformer instance to achieve state-of-the-art performance. However, in this process, these approaches need to make various trade-offs between performance and computational requirements. A major shortcoming, as compared to the Bi-LSTM based AttentionXML, is that they fail to keep separate feature representations for each resolution in a label tree. We thus propose CascadeXML, an end-to-end multi-resolution learning pipeline, which can harness the multi-layered architecture of a transformer model for attending to different label resolutions with separate feature representations. CascadeXML significantly outperforms all existing approaches with non-trivial gains obtained on benchmark datasets consisting of up to three million labels.

Latent Variable Sequential Set Transformers for Joint Multi-Agent Motion Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream processing transformers*\n\n*Roger Girgis, Florian Golemo, Felipe Codevilla, Martin Weiss, Jim Aldon D\u2019Souza, Samira Ebrahimi Kahou, Felix Heide, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** Latent Variable Sequential Set Transformers are encoder-decoder architectures that generate scene-consistent multi-agent trajectories that achieve top results on the global nuScenes vehicle motion prediction leaderboard, and produces strong results onThe Argoverse vehicle prediction challenge.\n\n**Abstract:** Robust multi-agent trajectory prediction is essential for the safe control of robotic systems. A major challenge is to efficiently learn a representation that approximates the true joint distribution of contextual, social, and temporal information to enable planning. We propose Latent Variable Sequential Set Transformers which are encoder-decoder architectures that generate scene-consistent multi-agent trajectories. We refer to these architectures as\"AutoBots\". The encoder is a stack of interleaved temporal and social multi-head self-attention (MHSA) modules which alternately perform equivariant processing across the temporal and social dimensions. The decoder employs learnable seed parameters in combination with temporal and social MHSA modules allowing it to perform inference over the entire future scene in a single forward pass efficiently. AutoBots can produce either the trajectory of one ego-agent or a distribution over the future trajectories for all agents in the scene. For the single-agent prediction case, our model achieves top results on the global nuScenes vehicle motion prediction leaderboard, and produces strong results on the Argoverse vehicle prediction challenge. In the multi-agent setting, we evaluate on the synthetic partition of TrajNet++ dataset to showcase the model's socially-consistent predictions. We also demonstrate our model on general sequences of sets and provide illustrative experiments modelling the sequential structure of the multiple strokes that make up symbols in the Omniglot data. A distinguishing feature of AutoBots is that all models are trainable on a single desktop GPU (1080 Ti) in under 48h.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 92  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Squeezeformer: An Efficient Transformer for Automatic Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid normalization architectures language models*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Jitendra Malik, Karttikeya Mangalam, Nicholas Lee, Albert Shaw, Amir Gholami, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** The recently proposed Conformer model has become the de facto backbone model for various downstream speech tasks based on its hybrid attention-convolution architecture that captures both local and global features. However, through a series of systematic studies, we find that the Conformer architecture's design choices are not optimal. After re-examining the design choices for both the macro and micro-architecture of Conformer, we propose Squeezeformer which consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art ASR models under the same training schemes. In particular, for the macro-architecture, Squeezeformer incorporates (i) the Temporal U-Net structure which reduces the cost of the multi-head attention modules on long sequences, and (ii) a simpler block structure of multi-head attention or convolution modules followed up by feed-forward module instead of the Macaron structure proposed in Conformer. Furthermore, for the micro-architecture, Squeezeformer (i) simplifies the activations in the convolutional block, (ii) removes redundant Layer Normalization operations, and (iii) incorporates an efficient depthwise down-sampling layer to efficiently sub-sample the input signal. Squeezeformer achieves state-of-the-art results of 7.5%, 6.5%, and 6.0% word-error-rate (WER) on LibriSpeech test-other without external language models, which are 3.1%, 1.4%, and 0.6% better than Conformer-CTC with the same number of FLOPs.

Adapting Sequence to Sequence models for Text Normalization in Social Media\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid normalization architectures language models*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Kabir Manghnani, Ismini Lourentzou*\n\n**Abstract:** Social media offer an abundant source of valuable raw data, however informal\nwriting can quickly become a bottleneck for many natural language processing\n(NLP) tasks. Off-the-shelf tools are usually trained on formal text and cannot\nexplicitly handle noise found in short online posts. Moreover, the variety of\nfrequently occurring linguistic variations presents several challenges, even\nfor humans who might not be able to comprehend the meaning of such posts,\nespecially when they contain slang and abbreviations. Text Normalization aims\nto transform online user-generated text to a canonical form. Current text\nnormalization systems rely on string or phonetic similarity and classification\nmodels that work on a local fashion. We argue that processing contextual\ninformation is crucial for this task and introduce a social media text\nnormalization hybrid word-character attention-based encoder-decoder model that\ncan serve as a pre-processing step for NLP applications to adapt to noisy text\nin social media. Our character-based component is trained on synthetic\nadversarial examples that are designed to capture errors commonly found in\nonline user-generated text. Experiments show that our model surpasses neural\narchitectures designed for text normalization and achieves comparable\nperformance with state-of-the-art related work.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-12\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Simple Approach to Improve Single-Model Deep Uncertainty via Distance-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization normalization layers*\n\n*Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Dustin Tran, Jasper Snoek, Zack Nado, Ghassen Jerfel, Yeming Wen, Zi Lin, Jie Ren, Shreyas Padhy, Jeremiah Zhe Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate uncertainty quantification is a major challenge in deep learning, as neural networks can make overconfident errors and assign high confidence predictions to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. The most popular approaches to estimate predictive uncertainty in deep learning are methods that combine predictions from multiple neural networks, such as Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and deep ensembles. However their practicality in real-time, industrial-scale applications are limited due to the high memory and computational cost. Furthermore, ensembles and BNNs do not necessarily fix all the issues with the underlying member networks. In this work, we study principled approaches to improve uncertainty property of a single network, based on a single, deterministic representation. By formalizing the uncertainty quantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify distance awareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing example from the training data, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that improves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs with two simple changes: (1) applying spectral normalization to hidden weights to enforce bi-Lipschitz smoothness in representations and (2) replacing the last output layer with a Gaussian process layer. On a suite of vision and language understanding benchmarks, SNGP outperforms other single-model approaches in prediction, calibration and out-of-domain detection. Furthermore, SNGP provides complementary benefits to popular techniques such as deep ensembles and data augmentation, making it a simple and scalable building block for probabilistic deep learning.

Simple and Principled Uncertainty Estimation with Deterministic Deep Learning via Distance Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization normalization layers*\n\n*Tania Bedrax-Weiss, Jeremiah Zhe Liu, Balaji Lakshminarayanan, Zi Lin, Shreyas Padhy, Dustin Tran*\n\n**Abstract:** Bayesian neural networks (BNN) and deep ensembles are principled approaches to estimate the predictive uncertainty of a deep learning model. However their practicality in real-time, industrial-scale applications are limited due to their heavy memory and inference cost. This motivates us to study principled approaches to high-quality uncertainty estimation that require only a single deep neural network (DNN). By formalizing the uncertainty quantification as a minimax learning problem, we first identify input distance awareness, i.e., the model's ability to quantify the distance of a testing example from the training data in the input space, as a necessary condition for a DNN to achieve high-quality (i.e., minimax optimal) uncertainty estimation. We then propose Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a simple method that improves the distance-awareness ability of modern DNNs, by adding a weight normalization step during training and replacing the output layer with a Gaussian process. On a suite of vision and language understanding tasks and on modern architectures (Wide-ResNet and BERT), SNGP is competitive with deep ensembles in prediction, calibration and out-of-domain detection, and outperforms the other single-model approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream processing transformers*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: multi-stream processing transformers*\n\n*Guoqi Li, Jason K. Eshraghian, Qihang Zhao, Rui-Jie Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hybrid architectures, memory optimization, multi-stream processing, and integration strategies, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining Different Normalization Layers\n\n- The concept of hybrid architectures can be inferred from studies that combine different techniques to enhance performance. For instance, the hybrid framework in the context of rare disease identification combines dictionary-based NLP tools with large language models (LLMs), leveraging the strengths of both techniques. While this is not directly about normalization layers, it suggests that combining different approaches can lead to superior performance.\n- A more relevant example is the use of different normalization techniques in transformer models. For example, layer normalization and other normalization methods can be combined or compared to see which hybrid approach works best. However, the provided sources do not explicitly discuss hybrid normalization architectures, indicating a need for further research in this area.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Normalization in Language Models\n\n- The study on state-free inference and transfer function parameterization provides insights into memory efficiency. For instance, Parnichkun et al.'s work on state-free inference shows significant memory efficiency without compromising performance, which could be integrated with normalization layers to optimize memory usage[References: Parnichkun et al. (2024)].\n- The normalization process described in the paper on combining entropy and Matrix Nuclear Norm for evaluating LLMs involves a two-step normalization (mean-centering and L2-norm scaling) which ensures stable and comparable representations, potentially optimizing memory usage by standardizing hidden states.\n\n## Multi-Stream Processing Architectures in Transformer Models\n\n- There is limited direct research on multi-stream adaptive normalization in language models. However, the concept of multi-stream processing can be explored through analogies in other domains. For example, the hybrid machine learning model for protein classification uses a lightweight transformer combined with a neural network, which could inspire multi-stream architectures in language models by integrating different processing streams.\n- The need for more investigation into multi-stream architectures for language models is highlighted, suggesting that exploring existing multi-stream approaches in other fields (like style transfer or vision tasks) could provide valuable insights[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Integration Strategies for Combining Different Normalization Approaches\n\n- The integration of different normalization approaches can be inferred from the hybrid evaluation method that combines entropy from covariance matrices with the Matrix Nuclear Norm (MNN). This method demonstrates how different techniques can be combined to provide a comprehensive evaluation framework, which could be adapted for normalization layers.\n- The use of layer normalization in transformer models and the potential to combine it with other normalization techniques (like batch normalization or instance normalization) could be explored. However, specific integration strategies for these combinations are not detailed in the provided sources.\n\n## Empirical Studies Comparing Different Normalization Techniques\n\n- Empirical studies comparing different normalization techniques are crucial but not directly addressed in the provided sources. However, the study on combining entropy and MNN for evaluating LLMs provides a framework for comparing and evaluating different model representations, which could be extended to compare normalization techniques.\n- To conduct empirical studies, researchers could follow the methodology of comparing different normalization layers (e.g., layer normalization vs. batch normalization) in terms of performance metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and memory efficiency.\n\nIn summary, while the provided sources do not directly address all the specific questions, they offer several insights and directions for further research:\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining different techniques as seen in rare disease identification and protein classification models.\n- **Memory Optimization**: State-free inference and transfer function parameterization as potential methods for optimizing memory usage.\n- **Multi-Stream Processing**: Exploring multi-stream architectures from other domains and adapting them for language models.\n- **Integration Strategies**: Combining different evaluation metrics as a model for integrating normalization approaches.\n- **Empirical Studies**: Conducting comparative studies to evaluate the performance of different normalization techniques.\n\nFurther research should focus on these areas to develop a comprehensive approach to improving autoregressive language model design.\n",

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

Sampling-free Inference for Ab-Initio Potential Energy Surface Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference neural networks*\n\n*Nicholas Gao, Stephan Gunnemann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Potential learning from ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which a surrogate model is simultaneously trained in addition to the neural wave function, and implements such a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been shown that neural networks not only approximate the ground-state wave functions of a single molecular system well but can also generalize to multiple geometries. While such generalization significantly speeds up training, each energy evaluation still requires Monte Carlo integration which limits the evaluation to a few geometries. In this work, we address the inference shortcomings by proposing the Potential learning from ab-initio Networks (PlaNet) framework, in which we simultaneously train a surrogate model in addition to the neural wave function. At inference time, the surrogate avoids expensive Monte-Carlo integration by directly estimating the energy, accelerating the process from hours to milliseconds. In this way, we can accurately model high-resolution multi-dimensional energy surfaces for larger systems that previously were unobtainable via neural wave functions. Finally, we explore an additional inductive bias by introducing physically-motivated restricted neural wave function models. We implement such a function with several additional improvements in the new PESNet++ model. In our experimental evaluation, PlaNet accelerates inference by 7 orders of magnitude for larger molecules like ethanol while preserving accuracy. Compared to previous energy surface networks, PESNet++ reduces energy errors by up to 74%.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Conformal inference is (almost) free for neural networks trained with early stopping\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference neural networks*\n\n*Zi-Chen Liang, Yan Zhou, Matteo Sesia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel method that combines early stopping with conformal calibration while efficiently recycling the same hold-out data leads to models that are both accurate and able to provide exact predictive inferences without multiple data splits nor overly conservative adjustments.\n\n**Abstract:** Early stopping based on hold-out data is a popular regularization technique designed to mitigate overfitting and increase the predictive accuracy of neural networks. Models trained with early stopping often provide relatively accurate predictions, but they generally still lack precise statistical guarantees unless they are further calibrated using independent hold-out data. This paper addresses the above limitation with conformalized early stopping: a novel method that combines early stopping with conformal calibration while efficiently recycling the same hold-out data. This leads to models that are both accurate and able to provide exact predictive inferences without multiple data splits nor overly conservative adjustments. Practical implementations are developed for different learning tasks -- outlier detection, multi-class classification, regression -- and their competitive performance is demonstrated on real data.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. EfficientNet: Rethinking Model Scaling for Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference neural networks*\n\n*Mingxing Tan, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new scaling method is proposed that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient and is demonstrated the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (ConvNets) are commonly developed at a fixed resource budget, and then scaled up for better accuracy if more resources are available. In this paper, we systematically study model scaling and identify that carefully balancing network depth, width, and resolution can lead to better performance. Based on this observation, we propose a new scaling method that uniformly scales all dimensions of depth/width/resolution using a simple yet highly effective compound coefficient. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on scaling up MobileNets and ResNet. \nTo go even further, we use neural architecture search to design a new baseline network and scale it up to obtain a family of models, called EfficientNets, which achieve much better accuracy and efficiency than previous ConvNets. In particular, our EfficientNet-B7 achieves state-of-the-art 84.4% top-1 / 97.1% top-5 accuracy on ImageNet, while being 8.4x smaller and 6.1x faster on inference than the best existing ConvNet. Our EfficientNets also transfer well and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on CIFAR-100 (91.7%), Flowers (98.8%), and 3 other transfer learning datasets, with an order of magnitude fewer parameters.

Few-Shot Bayesian Optimization with Deep Kernel Surrogates\n\n*From Search Query: transfer function optimization deep learning*\n\n*Martin Wistuba, Josif Grabocka*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of a deep kernel network for a Gaussian process surrogate that is meta-learned in an end-to-end fashion in order to jointly approximate the response functions of a collection of training data sets.\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) is a central pillar in the automation of machine learning solutions and is mainly performed via Bayesian optimization, where a parametric surrogate is learned to approximate the black box response function (e.g. validation error). Unfortunately, evaluating the response function is computationally intensive. As a remedy, earlier work emphasizes the need for transfer learning surrogates which learn to optimize hyperparameters for an algorithm from other tasks. In contrast to previous work, we propose to rethink HPO as a few-shot learning problem in which we train a shared deep surrogate model to quickly adapt (with few response evaluations) to the response function of a new task. We propose the use of a deep kernel network for a Gaussian process surrogate that is meta-learned in an end-to-end fashion in order to jointly approximate the response functions of a collection of training data sets. As a result, the novel few-shot optimization of our deep kernel surrogate leads to new state-of-the-art results at HPO compared to several recent methods on diverse metadata sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 5.

Our approach employs a bilevel optimization objective where we meta-learn generally useful feature representations across tasks, in the sense that task-specific GP models estimated on top of such features achieve the lowest possible predictive loss on average. We solve the resulting nested optimization problem using the implicit function theorem (IFT). We show that our ADKF-IFT framework contains previously proposed Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT) as special cases. Although ADKF-IFT is a completely general method, we argue that it is especially well-suited for drug discovery problems and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on a variety of real-world few-shot molecular property prediction tasks and out-of-domain molecular property prediction and optimization tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6.

Typically, BO relies on conventional Gaussian process (GP) regression, whose algorithmic complexity is cubic in the number of evaluations. As a result, GP-based BO cannot leverage large numbers of past function evaluations, for example, to warm-start related BO runs. We propose a multi-task adaptive Bayesian linear regression model for transfer learning in BO, whose complexity is linear in the function evaluations: one Bayesian linear regression model is associated to each black-box function optimization problem (or task), while transfer learning is achieved by coupling the models through a shared deep neural net. Experiments show that the neural net learns a representation suitable for warm-starting the black-box optimization problems and that BO runs can be accelerated when the target black-box function (e.g., validation loss) is learned together with other related signals (e.g., training loss). The proposed method was found to be at least one order of magnitude faster that methods recently published in the literature.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 24*)\n\n#### 7.

Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe.

A number of training-free metrics are recently proposed to realize NAS without training, hence making NAS more scalable. Despite their competitive empirical performances, a unified theoretical understanding of these training-free metrics is lacking. As a consequence, (a) the relationships among these metrics are unclear, (b) there is no theoretical interpretation for their empirical performances, and (c) there may exist untapped potential in existing training-free NAS, which probably can be unveiled through a unified theoretical understanding. To this end, this paper presents a unified theoretical analysis of gradient-based training-free NAS, which allows us to (a) theoretically study their relationships, (b) theoretically guarantee their generalization performances, and (c) exploit our unified theoretical understanding to develop a novel framework named hybrid NAS (HNAS) which consistently boosts training-free NAS in a principled way.

In this work, we are dedicated to studying key optimizations and neural network architecture choices for object detection to improve accuracy and efficiency. We investigate the applicability of the anchor-free strategy on lightweight object detection models. We enhance the backbone structure and design the lightweight structure of the neck, which improves the feature extraction ability of the network. We improve label assignment strategy and loss function to make training more stable and efficient. Through these optimizations, we create a new family of real-time object detectors, named PP-PicoDet, which achieves superior performance on object detection for mobile devices. Our models achieve better trade-offs between accuracy and latency compared to other popular models. PicoDet-S with only 0.99M parameters achieves 30.6% mAP, which is an absolute 4.8% improvement in mAP while reducing mobile CPU inference latency by 55% compared to YOLOX-Nano, and is an absolute 7.1% improvement in mAP compared to NanoDet. It reaches 123 FPS (150 FPS using Paddle Lite) on mobile ARM CPU when the input size is 320. PicoDet-L with only 3.3M parameters achieves 40.9% mAP, which is an absolute 3.7% improvement in mAP and 44% faster than YOLOv5s.

Blind Image Deblurring with Unknown Kernel Size and Substantial Noise\n\n*From Search Query: state-free inference neural networks*\n\n*Ju Sun, Hengkang Wang, Taihui Li, Zhong Zhuang*\n\n**Abstract:** Blind image deblurring (BID) has been extensively studied in computer vision and adjacent fields. Modern methods for BID can be grouped into two categories: single-instance methods that deal with individual instances using statistical inference and numerical optimization, and data-driven methods that train deep-learning models to deblur future instances directly. Data-driven methods can be free from the difficulty in deriving accurate blur models, but are fundamentally limited by the diversity and quality of the training data -- collecting sufficiently expressive and realistic training data is a standing challenge. In this paper, we focus on single-instance methods that remain competitive and indispensable. However, most such methods do not prescribe how to deal with unknown kernel size and substantial noise, precluding practical deployment. Indeed, we show that several state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-instance methods are unstable when the kernel size is overspecified, and/or the noise level is high. On the positive side, we propose a practical BID method that is stable against both, the first of its kind. Our method builds on the recent ideas of solving inverse problems by integrating the physical models and structured deep neural networks, without extra training data. We introduce several crucial modifications to achieve the desired stability. Extensive empirical tests on standard synthetic datasets, as well as real-world NTIRE2020 and RealBlur datasets, show the superior effectiveness and practicality of our BID method compared to SOTA single-instance as well as data-driven methods.

On CIFAR-10, our method discovers several update\nrules that are better than many commonly used optimizers, such as Adam,\nRMSProp, or SGD with and without Momentum on a ConvNet model. We introduce two\nnew optimizers, named PowerSign and AddSign, which we show transfer well and\nimprove training on a variety of different tasks and architectures, including\nImageNet classification and Google's neural machine translation system.\n\n**Published:** 2017-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Texture Networks: Feed-forward Synthesis of Textures and Stylized Images\n\n*From Search Query: transfer function optimization deep learning*\n\n*Victor Lempitsky, Vadim Lebedev, Dmitry Ulyanov, Andrea Vedaldi*\n\n**Abstract:** Gatys et al. recently demonstrated that deep networks can generate beautiful\ntextures and stylized images from a single texture example. However, their\nmethods requires a slow and memory-consuming optimization process. We propose\nhere an alternative approach that moves the computational burden to a learning\nstage. Given a single example of a texture, our approach trains compact\nfeed-forward convolutional networks to generate multiple samples of the same\ntexture of arbitrary size and to transfer artistic style from a given image to\nany other image. The resulting networks are remarkably light-weight and can\ngenerate textures of quality comparable to Gatys~et~al., but hundreds of times\nfaster. More generally, our approach highlights the power and flexibility of\ngenerative feed-forward models trained with complex and expressive loss\nfunctions.\n\n**Published:** 2016-03-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. AFS: An Attention-based mechanism for Supervised Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability training*\n\n*Danni Ge, Ning Gui, Ziyin Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its\neffectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks.\nThe proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has\nbrought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy\ndata, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel\nneural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based\nFeature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention\nmodule for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem\nmodeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features\nand supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a\nshallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on\nthe distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by\nbackpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows\nexisting off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less\ntraining time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A\nhybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection\naccuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation.\nExperimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in\ncomparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both\nMNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. Bringing Cartoons to Life: Towards Improved Cartoon Face Detection and Recognition Systems\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability training*\n\n*Nikhil Agarwal, Suneeta Agarwal, Saurav Jha*\n\n**Abstract:** Given the recent deep learning advancements in face detection and recognition\ntechniques for human faces, this paper answers the question \"how well would\nthey work for cartoons'?\" - a domain that remains largely unexplored until\nrecently, mainly due to the unavailability of large scale datasets and the\nfailure of traditional methods on these. Our work studies and extends multiple\nframeworks for the aforementioned tasks. For face detection, we incorporate the\nMulti-task Cascaded Convolutional Network (MTCNN) architecture and contrast it\nwith conventional methods. For face recognition, our two-fold contributions\ninclude: (i) an inductive transfer learning approach combining the feature\nlearning capability of the Inception v3 network and the feature recognizing\ncapability of Support Vector Machines (SVMs), (ii) a proposed Hybrid\nConvolutional Neural Network (HCNN) framework trained over a fusion of pixel\nvalues and 15 manually located facial keypoints. All the methods are evaluated\non the Cartoon Faces in the Wild (IIIT-CFW) database. We demonstrate that the\nHCNN model offers stability superior to that of Inception+SVM over larger input\nvariations, and explore the plausible architectural principles. We show that\nthe Inception+SVM model establishes a state-of-the-art F1 score on the task of\ngender recognition of cartoon faces. Further, we introduce a small database\nhosting location coordinates of 15 points on the cartoon faces belonging to 50\npublic figures of the IIIT-CFW database.\n\n**Published:** 2018-04-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on state-free inference, transfer function parameterization, training stability for hybrid architectures, memory-computation trade-offs, and multi-stream synchronization, here are some relevant insights and references:\n\n## State-Free Inference Implementation Details and Performance Benchmarks\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss state-free inference in the context of language models, the concept of state-free inference can be inferred from techniques that reduce memory overhead. For instance, the \"AdaLomo\" paper mentions low-memory optimization strategies, which could be relevant. However, specific state-free inference implementations in language models are not explicitly covered in the given sources. You may need to look into papers like \"AdaLomo\" for general low-memory optimization techniques that could be adapted.\n\n## Transfer Function Parameterization Methods and Applications in Neural Networks\n\n- Transfer function parameterization is crucial for memory efficiency. The paper \"Optimization Theory for ReLU Neural Networks Trained with Normalization Layers\" by Dukler et al. provides insights into optimization theories for neural networks, including how normalization layers can be optimized. While it does not specifically focus on transfer functions, it discusses the broader context of optimization in neural networks, which can be extended to transfer function parameterization.\n\n## Training Stability Analysis for Hybrid Architectures\n\n- Hybrid architectures, such as HybridBERT, have shown promise in improving pretraining accuracy by combining different attention mechanisms. The paper by Srinivasagan and Ostermann discusses how HybridBERT combines self-attention and additive attention mechanisms, achieving twice the pretraining accuracy. However, it also highlights the increased complexity and the need to investigate the stability of combined approaches.\n- The paper on \"ResInf\" discusses the integration of transformers and graph neural networks, which, although not directly related to language models, provides insights into how different components can be integrated and their stability analyzed. It shows that separating self- and neighbor-interaction components in GNNs can improve accuracy and stability.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-Offs in Normalization Layers\n\n- The \"Optimization Theory for ReLU Neural Networks Trained with Normalization Layers\" paper delves into the optimization of normalization layers, which is crucial for understanding the memory-computation trade-offs. It discusses how normalization layers affect the training dynamics and how they can be optimized to reduce computational and memory overhead.\n- The \"AdaLomo\" paper also addresses low-memory optimization strategies, which include adaptive learning rates and other techniques to reduce memory requirements. These strategies can be applied to normalization layers to achieve better trade-offs.\n\n## Multi-Stream Synchronization Strategies in Deep Learning\n\n- The concept of multi-stream processing is mentioned in the context of \"Event Stream GPT,\" which involves processing continuous-time sequences. While this is not directly about normalization, it suggests that multi-stream processing can be efficient in certain contexts. However, specific strategies for synchronization and parallelization in the context of language models are not detailed in the provided sources. You may need to explore more recent works or specific implementations of multi-stream architectures in language models.\n\n### Additional Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: The integration of different attention mechanisms (e.g., HybridBERT) shows promise but requires careful analysis of stability and performance impact. Investigating how these components interact and affect training dynamics is crucial.\n- **Memory Efficiency**: State-free inference and transfer function parameterization are key areas to explore for reducing memory overhead. Papers like \"AdaLomo\" and optimization theories for normalization layers can provide valuable insights.\n- **Multi-Stream Processing**: Exploring parallelization and synchronization strategies in multi-stream architectures, such as those used in \"Event Stream GPT,\" could help in optimizing memory bandwidth and computational efficiency.\n\nTo further improve the autoregressive language model design, the researchers should:\n- Investigate state-free inference techniques and their implementation details in language models.\n- Explore transfer function parameterization methods specifically tailored for language models.\n- Conduct thorough stability analysis for hybrid architectures, focusing on how different components interact.\n- Analyze memory-computation trade-offs in normalization layers and other components.\n- Develop and evaluate multi-stream synchronization strategies to optimize performance and memory usage.\n",

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

L2ight: Enabling On-Chip Learning for Optical Neural Networks via Efficient in-situ Subspace Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, Chenghao Feng, Zixuan Jiang, Ray T. Chen, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This synergistic framework L2ight is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.\n\n**Abstract:** Silicon-photonics-based optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient AI with its CMOS-compatibility, flexibility, ultra-low execution latency, and high energy efficiency. In-situ training on the online programmable photonic chips is appealing but still encounters challenging issues in on-chip implementability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework L2ight to enable scalable ONN mapping and efficient in-situ learning. L2ight adopts a three-stage learning flow that first calibrates the complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints, then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips. From a co-design perspective, L2ight also provides essential insights for hardware-restricted unitary subspace optimization and efficient sparse training.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Mechanistic Design and Scaling of Hybrid Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: initialization training hybrid architectures*\n\n*Michael Poli, Armin W. Thomas, Eric Nguyen, Pragaash Ponnusamy, Bjorn Deiseroth, K. Kersting, Taiji Suzuki, Brian Hie, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R'e, Ce Zhang, Stefano Massaroli*\n\n**TL;DR:** Results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Robust Training of Neural Networks using Scale Invariant Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: initialization training hybrid architectures*\n\n*Zhiyuan Li, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, M. Zaheer, Sashank J. Reddi, Surinder Kumar*\n\n**TL;DR:** A scale invariant version of BERT is designed, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In contrast to SGD, adaptive gradient methods like Adam allow robust training of modern deep networks, especially large language models. However, the use of adaptivity not only comes at the cost of extra memory but also raises the fundamental question: can non-adaptive methods like SGD enjoy similar benefits? In this paper, we provide an affirmative answer to this question by proposing to achieve both robust and memory-efficient training via the following general recipe: (1) modify the architecture and make it scale invariant, i.e. the scale of parameter doesn't affect the output of the network, (2) train with SGD and weight decay, and optionally (3) clip the global gradient norm proportional to weight norm multiplied by $\\sqrt{\\tfrac{2\\lambda}{\\eta}}$, where $\\eta$ is learning rate and $\\lambda$ is weight decay. We show that this general approach is robust to rescaling of parameter and loss by proving that its convergence only depends logarithmically on the scale of initialization and loss, whereas the standard SGD might not even converge for many initializations. Following our recipe, we design a scale invariant version of BERT, called SIBERT, which when trained simply by vanilla SGD achieves performance comparable to BERT trained by adaptive methods like Adam on downstream tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. MLPInit: Embarrassingly Simple GNN Training Acceleration with MLP Initialization\n\n*From Search Query: initialization training hybrid architectures*\n\n*Xiaotian Han, Tong Zhao, Yozen Liu, Xia Hu, Neil Shah*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, it is found that GNNs initialized with such weights significantly outperform their PeerMLPs, motivating us to use PeerMLP training as a precursor, initialization step to GNN training.\n\n**Abstract:** Training graph neural networks (GNNs) on large graphs is complex and extremely time consuming. This is attributed to overheads caused by sparse matrix multiplication, which are sidestepped when training multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) with only node features. MLPs, by ignoring graph context, are simple and faster for graph data, however they usually sacrifice prediction accuracy, limiting their applications for graph data. We observe that for most message passing-based GNNs, we can trivially derive an analog MLP (we call this a PeerMLP) with an equivalent weight space, by setting the trainable parameters with the same shapes, making us curious about \\textbf{\\emph{how do GNNs using weights from a fully trained PeerMLP perform?}} Surprisingly, we find that GNNs initialized with such weights significantly outperform their PeerMLPs, motivating us to use PeerMLP training as a precursor, initialization step to GNN training. To this end, we propose an embarrassingly simple, yet hugely effective initialization method for GNN training acceleration, called MLPInit. Our extensive experiments on multiple large-scale graph datasets with diverse GNN architectures validate that MLPInit can accelerate the training of GNNs (up to 33X speedup on OGB-Products) and often improve prediction performance (e.g., up to $7.97\\%$ improvement for GraphSAGE across $7$ datasets for node classification, and up to $17.81\\%$ improvement across $4$ datasets for link prediction on metric Hits@10).

Researchers are now beginning to use recent advances in machine learning in software optimizations, augmenting or replacing traditional heuristics and data structures. However, the space of machine learning for computer hardware architecture is only lightly explored. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning to address the von Neumann bottleneck of memory performance. We focus on the critical problem of learning memory access patterns, with the goal of constructing accurate and efficient memory prefetchers. We relate contemporary prefetching strategies to n-gram models in natural language processing, and show how recurrent neural networks can serve as a drop-in replacement. On a suite of challenging benchmark datasets, we find that neural networks consistently demonstrate superior performance in terms of precision and recall. This work represents the first step towards practical neural-network based prefetching, and opens a wide range of exciting directions for machine learning in computer architecture research.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 185  (*Influential: 23*)\n\n#### 8.

The existing state-of-the-art, Differentially Private Stochastic Gradient Descent (DP-SGD), requires privacy amplification by sampling or shuffling to obtain the best privacy/accuracy/computation trade-offs. Unfortunately, the precise requirements on exact sampling and shuffling can be hard to obtain in important practical scenarios, particularly federated learning (FL). We design and analyze a DP variant of Follow-The-Regularized-Leader (DP-FTRL) that compares favorably (both theoretically and empirically) to amplified DP-SGD, while allowing for much more flexible data access patterns. DP-FTRL does not use any form of privacy amplification.

Point-Voxel CNN for Efficient 3D Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory access patterns deep learning*\n\n*Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang, Yujun Lin, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes PVCNN that represents the 3D input data in points to reduce the memory consumption, while performing the convolutions in voxels to largely reduce the irregular data access and improve the locality.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Point-Voxel CNN (PVCNN) for efficient, fast 3D deep learning. Previous work processes 3D data using either voxel-based or point-based NN models. However, both approaches are computationally inefficient. The computation cost and memory footprints of the voxel-based models grow cubically with the input resolution, making it memory-prohibitive to scale up the resolution. As for point-based networks, up to 80% of the time is wasted on structuring the irregular data which have rather poor memory locality, not on the actual feature extraction. In this paper, we propose PVCNN that represents the 3D input data in points to reduce the memory consumption, while performing the convolutions in voxels to largely reduce the irregular data access and improve the locality. Our PVCNN model is both memory and computation efficient. Evaluated on semantic and part segmentation datasets, it achieves much higher accuracy than the voxel-based baseline with 10x GPU memory reduction; it also outperforms the state-of-the-art point-based models with 7x measured speedup on average. Remarkably, narrower version of PVCNN achieves 2x speedup over PointNet (an extremely efficient model) on part and scene segmentation benchmarks with much higher accuracy. We validate the general effectiveness of our PVCNN on 3D object detection: by replacing the primitives in Frustrum PointNet with PVConv, it outperforms Frustrum PointNet++ by 2.4% mAP on average with 1.5x measured speedup and GPU memory reduction.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 594  (*Influential: 61*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice recognition, and machine vision.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. UTNet: A Hybrid Transformer Architecture for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: initialization training hybrid architectures*\n\n*Dimitris Metaxas, Mu Zhou, Yunhe Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architecture has emerged to be successful in a number of natural language processing tasks. However, its applications to medical vision remain largely unexplored. In this study, we present UTNet, a simple yet powerful hybrid Transformer architecture that integrates self-attention into a convolutional neural network for enhancing medical image segmentation. UTNet applies self-attention modules in both encoder and decoder for capturing long-range dependency at different scales with minimal overhead. To this end, we propose an efficient self-attention mechanism along with relative position encoding that reduces the complexity of self-attention operation significantly from $O(n^2)$ to approximate $O(n)$. A new self-attention decoder is also proposed to recover fine-grained details from the skipped connections in the encoder. Our approach addresses the dilemma that Transformer requires huge amounts of data to learn vision inductive bias. Our hybrid layer design allows the initialization of Transformer into convolutional networks without a need of pre-training. We have evaluated UTNet on the multi-label, multi-vendor cardiac magnetic resonance imaging cohort. UTNet demonstrates superior segmentation performance and robustness against the state-of-the-art approaches, holding the promise to generalize well on other medical image segmentations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learnable Weight Initialization for Volumetric Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: initialization training hybrid architectures*\n\n*Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Salman Khan, Muzammal Naseer, Abdelrahman Shaker, Shahina Kunhimon*\n\n**Abstract:** Hybrid volumetric medical image segmentation models, combining the advantages of local convolution and global attention, have recently received considerable attention. While mainly focusing on architectural modifications, most existing hybrid approaches still use conventional data-independent weight initialization schemes which restrict their performance due to ignoring the inherent volumetric nature of the medical data. To address this issue, we propose a learnable weight initialization approach that utilizes the available medical training data to effectively learn the contextual and structural cues via the proposed self-supervised objectives. Our approach is easy to integrate into any hybrid model and requires no external training data. Experiments on multi-organ and lung cancer segmentation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, leading to state-of-the-art segmentation performance. Our proposed data-dependent initialization approach performs favorably as compared to the Swin-UNETR model pretrained using large-scale datasets on multi-organ segmentation task.

Hopfield Networks is All You Need\n\n*From Search Query: memory access patterns deep learning*\n\n*Thomas Adler, Sepp Hochreiter, G\u00fcnter Klambauer, Milena Pavlovi\u0107, Markus Holzleitner, Bernhard Sch\u00e4fl, Victor Greiff, Michael Widrich, Michael Kopp, Johannes Brandstetter, Hubert Ramsauer, Lukas Gruber, Philipp Seidl, Johannes Lehner, Geir Kjetil Sandve, David Kreil*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a modern Hopfield network with continuous states and a corresponding update rule. The new Hopfield network can store exponentially (with the dimension of the associative space) many patterns, retrieves the pattern with one update, and has exponentially small retrieval errors. It has three types of energy minima (fixed points of the update): (1) global fixed point averaging over all patterns, (2) metastable states averaging over a subset of patterns, and (3) fixed points which store a single pattern. The new update rule is equivalent to the attention mechanism used in transformers. This equivalence enables a characterization of the heads of transformer models. These heads perform in the first layers preferably global averaging and in higher layers partial averaging via metastable states. The new modern Hopfield network can be integrated into deep learning architectures as layers to allow the storage of and access to raw input data, intermediate results, or learned prototypes. These Hopfield layers enable new ways of deep learning, beyond fully-connected, convolutional, or recurrent networks, and provide pooling, memory, association, and attention mechanisms. We demonstrate the broad applicability of the Hopfield layers across various domains. Hopfield layers improved state-of-the-art on three out of four considered multiple instance learning problems as well as on immune repertoire classification with several hundreds of thousands of instances. On the UCI benchmark collections of small classification tasks, where deep learning methods typically struggle, Hopfield layers yielded a new state-of-the-art when compared to different machine learning methods. Finally, Hopfield layers achieved state-of-the-art on two drug design datasets.

TorchSparse++: Efficient Training and Inference Framework for Sparse Convolution on GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: memory access patterns deep learning*\n\n*Song Han, Yu Wang, Guohao Dai, Xiuyu Li, Zhongming Yu, Ke Hong, Zhijian Liu, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse convolution plays a pivotal role in emerging workloads, including point cloud processing in AR/VR, autonomous driving, and graph understanding in recommendation systems. Since the computation pattern is sparse and irregular, specialized high-performance kernels are required. Existing GPU libraries offer two dataflow types for sparse convolution. The gather-GEMM-scatter dataflow is easy to implement but not optimal in performance, while the dataflows with overlapped computation and memory access (e.g.implicit GEMM) are highly performant but have very high engineering costs. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse++, a new GPU library that achieves the best of both worlds. We create a highly efficient Sparse Kernel Generator that generates performant sparse convolution kernels at less than one-tenth of the engineering cost of the current state-of-the-art system. On top of this, we design the Sparse Autotuner, which extends the design space of existing sparse convolution libraries and searches for the best dataflow configurations for training and inference workloads. Consequently, TorchSparse++ achieves 2.9x, 3.3x, 2.2x and 1.7x measured end-to-end speedup on an NVIDIA A100 GPU over state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine, SpConv 1.2, TorchSparse and SpConv v2 in inference; and is 1.2-1.3x faster than SpConv v2 in mixed precision training across seven representative autonomous driving benchmarks. It also seamlessly supports graph convolutions, achieving 2.6-7.6x faster inference speed compared with state-of-the-art graph deep learning libraries.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-specific optimization, initialization and training of hybrid architectures, memory access pattern optimization, empirical evaluations, and training stability, here are some key points and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies for Neural Network Inference\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Neural Network Design**: The paper on reducing data bottlenecks in distributed, heterogeneous neural networks highlights the importance of hardware-aware optimization.

    "proposal": "# StateAdaptiveNorm-GPT: Efficient State-Free Adaptive Normalization for Language Models\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face challenges in balancing computational efficiency, memory usage, and adaptive capabilities. While Parent 1 (AdaptiveNorm-GPT) introduces dynamic parameter generation and multi-scale processing, and Parent 2 (HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm) provides efficient state processing through TTT architecture, both designs have limitations in memory efficiency and computational overhead. By combining their strengths and introducing state-free inference techniques, we can create a more efficient and scalable architecture.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Parent 1 (AdaptiveNorm-GPT) Analysis:\nStrengths:\n- Dynamic parameter generation based on input context\n- Multi-scale statistics computation\n- Adaptive scale integration\n\nLimitations:\n- High memory overhead from storing multiple sets of statistics\n- Computational cost of dynamic parameter generation\n- Limited integration with modern architectures\n\n### Parent 2 (HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm) Analysis:\nStrengths:\n- Efficient state processing through TTT architecture\n- Hierarchical structure for multi-scale processing\n- Integration with modern architectures\n\nLimitations:\n- Complex interaction between multi-scale processing and adaptive scaling\n- Memory access patterns need optimization\n- Limited use of state-free techniques\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nStateAdaptiveNorm-GPT introduces three key innovations:\n\n1. **State-Free Adaptive Normalization**: Combines dynamic parameter generation with state-free inference techniques to reduce memory overhead while maintaining adaptability.\n\n2. **Multi-Stream Processing**: Implements parallel processing of different scales through efficient stream management and transfer function parameterization.\n\n3. **Memory-Efficient Integration**: Uses B'MOJO-inspired hybrid architecture to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### 1. State-Free Adaptive Normalization\n\n```python\nclass StateAdaptiveNorm(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales, eps=1e-5):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.embed_dim = embed_dim\n        self.num_scales = num_scales\n        self.eps = eps\n        \n        # Transfer function parameterization\n        self.transfer_fn = TransferFunctionLayer(embed_dim, num_scales)\n        \n        # Scale-specific parameters\n        self.scale_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_scales, embed_dim))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Compute scale-specific statistics using transfer functions\n        scale_stats = self.transfer_fn(x)\n        \n        # Apply state-free normalization\n        normalized = []\n        for i in range(self.num_scales):\n            scale_norm = x / torch.sqrt(scale_stats[i] + self.eps)\n            scale_norm = scale_norm * self.scale_weights[i]\n            normalized.append(scale_norm)\n            \n        return torch.stack(normalized, dim=1)\n```\n\n### 2. Multi-Stream Processing\n\n```python\nclass MultiStreamProcessor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_streams):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.streams = nn.ModuleList([\n            StreamProcessor(embed_dim) \n            for _ in range(num_streams)\n        ])\n        self.stream_fusion = StreamFusion(embed_dim, num_streams)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Process streams in parallel\n        stream_outputs = [\n            stream(x) for stream in self.streams\n        ]\n        \n        # Fuse stream outputs\n        return self.stream_fusion(stream_outputs)\n```\n\n### 3. Memory-Efficient Integration\n\n```python\nclass StateAdaptiveBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.norm = StateAdaptiveNorm(embed_dim, num_scales)\n        self.processor = MultiStreamProcessor(embed_dim, num_scales)\n        self.memory_manager = EfficientMemoryManager(embed_dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Apply state-free normalization\n        norm_out = self.norm(x)\n        \n        # Process through multiple streams\n        processed = self.processor(norm_out)\n        \n        # Manage memory efficiently\n        return self.memory_manager(processed)\n```\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. **State-Free Normalization**:\n   For input x and scale s:\n   ```\n   \u03bcs(x) = TransferFn_s(x)\n   y_s = (x / sqrt(\u03bcs(x) + \u03b5)) * w_s\n   ```\n\n2. **Multi-Stream Processing**:\n   For stream i:\n   ```\n   stream_i(x) = StreamProcessor_i(x)\n   y = Fusion(stream_1(x), ..., stream_n(x))\n   ```\n\n3. **Memory Management**:\n   ```\n   mem_state = UpdateState(current_state, new_input)\n   output = CombineState(mem_state, processed_input)\n   ```\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n```python\ndef initialize_state_adaptive_norm(model):\n    for module in model.modules():\n        if isinstance(module, StateAdaptiveNorm):\n            nn.init.ones_(module.scale_weights)\n            initialize_transfer_fn(module.transfer_fn)\n```\n\n2. **Memory Management**:\n```python\nclass EfficientMemoryManager:\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        self.dim = dim\n        self.state_size = compute_optimal_state_size(dim)\n        \n    def update_state(self, current_state, new_input):\n        # Implement efficient state update using transfer functions\n        return updated_state\n```\n\n3. **Stream Processing**:\n```python\nclass StreamProcessor:\n    def __init__(self, dim):\n        self.dim = dim\n        self.processor = design_efficient_processor(dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        return self.processor(x)\n```\n\n## Research Summary\n\nKey findings that influenced the design:\n1.
