Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/70 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01652, 2021.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

Explicitly Encoding Structural Symmetry is Key to Length Generalization in Arithmetic Tasks (Avg. Score: 0.32)\n\n*Mahdi Sabbaghi, George J Pappas, Hamed Hassani, Surbhi Goel*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that explicit incorporation of structure via positional encodings is necessary for out-of-distribution generalization, and pinpoint other challenges inherent to length generalization beyond capturing symmetries, in particular complexity of the underlying task.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the success of Transformers on language understanding, code generation, and logical reasoning, they still fail to generalize over length on basic arithmetic tasks such as addition and multiplication. A major reason behind this failure is the vast difference in structure between numbers and text; For example, the numbers are typically parsed from right to left, and there is a correspondence between digits at the same position across different numbers. In contrast, for text, such symmetries are quite unnatural. In this work, we propose to encode these semantics explicitly into the model via modified number formatting and custom positional encodings. Empirically, our method allows a Transformer trained on numbers with at most 5-digits for addition and multiplication to generalize up to 50-digit numbers, without using additional data for longer sequences. We further demonstrate that traditional absolute positional encodings (APE) fail to generalize to longer sequences, even when trained with augmented data that captures task symmetries. To elucidate the importance of explicitly encoding structure, we prove that explicit incorporation of structure via positional encodings is necessary for out-of-distribution generalization. Finally, we pinpoint other challenges inherent to length generalization beyond capturing symmetries, in particular complexity of the underlying task, and propose changes in the training distribution to address them.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/36 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2305.18654, 2023. 1, 2, 19\n$\\left[\\mathrm{ENO}^{+}\\right.$21] Nelson Elhage, Neel Nanda, Catherine Olsson, Tom Henighan, Nicholas Joseph, Ben Mann, Amanda Askell, Yuntao Bai, Anna Chen, Tom Conerly, Nova DasSarma, Dawn Drain, Deep Ganguli, Zac Hatfield-Dodds, Danny Hernandez, Andy Jones, Jackson Kernion, Liane Lovitt, Kamal Ndousse, Dario Amodei, Tom Brown, Jack Clark, Jared Kaplan, Sam McCandlish, and Chris Olah.

These networks rely heavily on the dot product attention operator, which computes the similarity between two points by taking their inner product. However, the inner product does not explicitly model the complex structural properties of real world datasets, such as hierarchies between data points. To remedy this, we introduce cone attention, a drop-in replacement for dot product attention based on hyperbolic entailment cones. Cone attention associates two points by the depth of their lowest common ancestor in a hierarchy defined by hyperbolic cones, which intuitively measures the divergence of two points and gives a hierarchy aware similarity score. We test cone attention on a wide variety of models and tasks and show that it improves task-level performance over dot product attention and other baselines, and is able to match dot-product attention with significantly fewer parameters. Our results suggest that cone attention is an effective way to capture hierarchical relationships when calculating attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/31 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 10183-10192.

PIDformer: Transformer Meets Control Theory\n\n*From Search Query: transformer stability theory*\n\n*Tam Nguyen, C'esar A. Uribe, Tan M. Nguyen, R. Baraniuk*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel class of transformers is derived, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we address two main shortcomings of transformer architectures: input corruption and rank collapse in their output representation. We unveil self-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes smoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished representation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is sensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers. We empirically evaluate the model for advantages and robustness against baseline transformers across various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width, and shows that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation indexed by the depth-to-width ratio.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning theory, the covariance matrix of the representations serves as a proxy to examine the network's trainability. Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: transformer stability theory*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 4. Chaotic Dynamics are Intrinsic to Neural Network Training with SGD\n\n*From Search Query: eigenspectrum analysis*\n\n*Luis M. Herrmann, Maximilian Granz, Tim Landgraf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The theoretical connection between the curvature of the loss landscape and chaotic dynamics in neural network training is exploited to propose a modified SGD ensuring non-chaotic training dynamics to study the importance thereof in NN training and empirical evidence suggesting that the negative eigenspectrum cannot be removed from SGD without hurting training performance is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** With the advent of deep learning over the last decade, a considerable amount of effort has gone into better understanding and enhancing Stochastic Gradient Descent so as to improve the performance and stability of artificial neural network training. Active research fields in this area include exploiting second order information of the loss landscape and improving the understanding of chaotic dynamics in optimization. This paper exploits the theoretical connection between the curvature of the loss landscape and chaotic dynamics in neural network training to propose a modified SGD ensuring non-chaotic training dynamics to study the importance thereof in NN training. Building on this, we present empirical evidence suggesting that the negative eigenspectrum - and thus directions of local chaos - cannot be removed from SGD without hurting training performance. Extending our empirical analysis to long-term chaos dynamics, we challenge the widespread understanding of convergence against a confined region in parameter space. Our results show that although chaotic network behavior is mostly confined to the initial training phase, models perturbed upon initialization do diverge at a slow pace even after reaching top training performance, and that their divergence can be modelled through a composition of a random walk and a linear divergence. The tools and insights developed as part of our work contribute to improving the understanding of neural network training dynamics and provide a basis for future improvements of optimization methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Hessian Eigenspectra of More Realistic Nonlinear Models\n\n*From Search Query: eigenspectrum analysis*\n\n*Zhenyu Liao, Michael W. Mahoney*\n\n**TL;DR:** Deterministic equivalent techniques from random matrix theory are exploited to make a precise characterization of the Hessian eigenspectra for a broad family of nonlinear models, including models that generalize the classical generalized linear models, without relying on strong simplifying assumptions used previously.\n\n**Abstract:** Given an optimization problem, the Hessian matrix and its eigenspectrum can be used in many ways, ranging from designing more efficient second-order algorithms to performing model analysis and regression diagnostics. When nonlinear models and non-convex problems are considered, strong simplifying assumptions are often made to make Hessian spectral analysis more tractable. This leads to the question of how relevant the conclusions of such analyses are for more realistic nonlinear models. In this paper, we exploit deterministic equivalent techniques from random matrix theory to make a \\emph{precise} characterization of the Hessian eigenspectra for a broad family of nonlinear models, including models that generalize the classical generalized linear models, without relying on strong simplifying assumptions used previously. We show that, depending on the data properties, the nonlinear response model, and the loss function, the Hessian can have \\emph{qualitatively} different spectral behaviors: of bounded or unbounded support, with single- or multi-bulk, and with isolated eigenvalues on the left- or right-hand side of the bulk. By focusing on such a simple but nontrivial nonlinear model, our analysis takes a step forward to unveil the theoretical origin of many visually striking features observed in more complex machine learning models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. A Normative Theory of Adaptive Dimensionality Reduction in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: eigenspectrum analysis*\n\n*C. Pehlevan, D. Chklovskii*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work derives biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input covariance matrix and formulate three objective functions which, in the offline setting, are optimized by the projections of theinput dataset onto its principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance Matrix.\n\n**Abstract:** To make sense of the world our brains must analyze high-dimensional datasets streamed by our sensory organs. Because such analysis begins with dimensionality reduction, modelling early sensory processing requires biologically plausible online dimensionality reduction algorithms. Recently, we derived such an algorithm, termed similarity matching, from a Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) objective function. However, in the existing algorithm, the number of output dimensions is set a priori by the number of output neurons and cannot be changed. Because the number of informative dimensions in sensory inputs is variable there is a need for adaptive dimensionality reduction. Here, we derive biologically plausible dimensionality reduction algorithms which adapt the number of output dimensions to the eigenspectrum of the input covariance matrix. We formulate three objective functions which, in the offline setting, are optimized by the projections of the input dataset onto its principal subspace scaled by the eigenvalues of the output covariance matrix. In turn, the output eigenvalues are computed as i) soft-thresholded, ii) hard-thresholded, iii) equalized thresholded eigenvalues of the input covariance matrix. In the online setting, we derive the three corresponding adaptive algorithms and map them onto the dynamics of neuronal activity in networks with biologically plausible local learning rules. Remarkably, in the last two networks, neurons are divided into two classes which we identify with principal neurons and interneurons in biological circuits.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. Revisiting Gradient Clipping: Stochastic bias and tight convergence guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: convergence guarantees*\n\n*Anastasia Koloskova, Hadrien Hendrikx, Sebastian U. Stich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Convergence guarantees that show precise dependence on arbitrary clipping thresholds are given and show that the guarantees are tight with both deterministic and stochastic gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient clipping is a popular modification to standard (stochastic) gradient descent, at every iteration limiting the gradient norm to a certain value $c>0$. It is widely used for example for stabilizing the training of deep learning models (Goodfellow et al., 2016), or for enforcing differential privacy (Abadi et al., 2016). Despite popularity and simplicity of the clipping mechanism, its convergence guarantees often require specific values of $c$ and strong noise assumptions. In this paper, we give convergence guarantees that show precise dependence on arbitrary clipping thresholds $c$ and show that our guarantees are tight with both deterministic and stochastic gradients. In particular, we show that (i) for deterministic gradient descent, the clipping threshold only affects the higher-order terms of convergence, (ii) in the stochastic setting convergence to the true optimum cannot be guaranteed under the standard noise assumption, even under arbitrary small step-sizes. We give matching upper and lower bounds for convergence of the gradient norm when running clipped SGD, and illustrate these results with experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8.

We suggest this is due to a theoretical gap in existing stochastic optimization proofs: namely the challenge of gradient estimators with unusual noise bounds, and a composite non-smooth objective. For dense Gaussian variational families, we observe that existing gradient estimators based on reparameterization satisfy a quadratic noise bound and give novel convergence guarantees for proximal and projected stochastic gradient descent using this bound. This provides rigorous guarantees that methods similar to those used in practice converge on realistic inference problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9. Sharper Convergence Guarantees for Asynchronous SGD for Distributed and Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: convergence guarantees*\n\n*Anastasia Koloskova, Sebastian U. Stich, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** The asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm for distributed training over $n$ workers is studied and it is shown for the first time that asynchronous SGD is always faster than mini-batch SGD.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm for distributed training over $n$ workers which have varying computation and communication frequency over time. In this algorithm, workers compute stochastic gradients in parallel at their own pace and return those to the server without any synchronization. Existing convergence rates of this algorithm for non-convex smooth objectives depend on the maximum gradient delay $\\tau_{\\max}$ and show that an $\\epsilon$-stationary point is reached after $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\sigma^2\\epsilon^{-2}+ \\tau_{\\max}\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ iterations, where $\\sigma$ denotes the variance of stochastic gradients. In this work (i) we obtain a tighter convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\sigma^2\\epsilon^{-2}+ \\sqrt{\\tau_{\\max}\\tau_{avg}}\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$ without any change in the algorithm where $\\tau_{avg}$ is the average delay, which can be significantly smaller than $\\tau_{\\max}$. We also provide (ii) a simple delay-adaptive learning rate scheme, under which asynchronous SGD achieves a convergence rate of $\\mathcal{O}\\!\\left(\\sigma^2\\epsilon^{-2}+ \\tau_{avg}\\epsilon^{-1}\\right)$, and does not require any extra hyperparameter tuning nor extra communications. Our result allows to show for the first time that asynchronous SGD is always faster than mini-batch SGD. In addition, (iii) we consider the case of heterogeneous functions motivated by federated learning applications and improve the convergence rate by proving a weaker dependence on the maximum delay compared to prior works. In particular, we show that the heterogeneity term in convergence rate is only affected by the average delay within each worker.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 64  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Chain of LoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models via Residual\n  Learning\n\n*From Search Query: convergence guarantees*\n\n*Wenhan Xia, Chengwei Qin, Elad Hazan*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning is the primary methodology for tailoring pre-trained large\nlanguage models to specific tasks. As the model's scale and the diversity of\ntasks expand, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods are of paramount\nimportance. One of the most widely used family of methods is low-rank\nadaptation (LoRA) and its variants. LoRA encodes weight update as the product\nof two low-rank matrices. Despite its advantages, LoRA falls short of\nfull-parameter fine-tuning in terms of generalization error for certain tasks.\n  We introduce Chain of LoRA (COLA), an iterative optimization framework\ninspired by the Frank-Wolfe algorithm, to bridge the gap between LoRA and full\nparameter fine-tuning, without incurring additional computational costs or\nmemory overheads. COLA employs a residual learning procedure where it merges\nlearned LoRA modules into the pre-trained language model parameters and\nre-initilize optimization for new born LoRA modules. We provide theoretical\nconvergence guarantees as well as empirical results to validate the\neffectiveness of our algorithm. Across various models (OPT and llama-2) and\nseven benchmarking tasks, we demonstrate that COLA can consistently outperform\nLoRA without additional computational or memory costs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-08T14:26:49Z  (*Updated: 2024-01-08T14:26:49Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. An embedded segmental K-means model for unsupervised segmentation and\n  clustering of speech\n\n*From Search Query: convergence guarantees*\n\n*Herman Kamper, Karen Livescu, Sharon Goldwater*\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised segmentation and clustering of unlabelled speech are core\nproblems in zero-resource speech processing. Most approaches lie at\nmethodological extremes: some use probabilistic Bayesian models with\nconvergence guarantees, while others opt for more efficient heuristic\ntechniques. Despite competitive performance in previous work, the full Bayesian\napproach is difficult to scale to large speech corpora. We introduce an\napproximation to a recent Bayesian model that still has a clear objective\nfunction but improves efficiency by using hard clustering and segmentation\nrather than full Bayesian inference. Like its Bayesian counterpart, this\nembedded segmental K-means model (ES-KMeans) represents arbitrary-length word\nsegments as fixed-dimensional acoustic word embeddings. We first compare\nES-KMeans to previous approaches on common English and Xitsonga data sets (5\nand 2.5 hours of speech): ES-KMeans outperforms a leading heuristic method in\nword segmentation, giving similar scores to the Bayesian model while being 5\ntimes faster with fewer hyperparameters. However, its clusters are less pure\nthan those of the other models. We then show that ES-KMeans scales to larger\ncorpora by applying it to the 5 languages of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge\n2017 (up to 45 hours), where it performs competitively compared to the\nchallenge baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-23T16:45:22Z  (*Updated: 2017-09-05T14:14:11Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Waste Not, Want Not: Why Rarefying Microbiome Data is Inadmissible\n\n*From Search Query: transformer stability theory*\n\n*Susan Holmes, Paul J. McMurdie*\n\n**Abstract:** The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq.\n\n**Published:** 2013-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Observation of Time-Crystalline Eigenstate Order on a Quantum Processor\n\n*From Search Query: eigenspectrum analysis*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantum many-body systems display rich phase structure in their low-temperature equilibrium states. However, much of nature is not in thermal equilibrium. Remarkably, it was recently predicted that out-of-equilibrium systems can exhibit novel dynamical phases that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics, a paradigmatic example being the discrete time crystal (DTC). Concretely, dynamical phases can be defined in periodically driven many-body localized systems via the concept of eigenstate order. In eigenstate-ordered phases, the entire many-body spectrum exhibits quantum correlations and long-range order, with characteristic signatures in late-time dynamics from all initial states. It is, however, challenging to experimentally distinguish such stable phases from transient phenomena, wherein few select states can mask typical behavior. Here we implement a continuous family of tunable CPHASE gates on an array of superconducting qubits to experimentally observe an eigenstate-ordered DTC. We demonstrate the characteristic spatiotemporal response of a DTC for generic initial states. Our work employs a time-reversal protocol that discriminates external decoherence from intrinsic thermalization, and leverages quantum typicality to circumvent the exponential cost of densely sampling the eigenspectrum. In addition, we locate the phase transition out of the DTC with an experimental finite-size analysis. These results establish a scalable approach to study non-equilibrium phases of matter on current quantum processors.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-28\n\n\n\n#### 4. Reaction-drift-diffusion models from master equations: application to material defects\n\n*From Search Query: eigenspectrum analysis*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a general method to produce well-conditioned continuum reaction-drift-diffusion equations directly from master equations on a discrete, periodic state space. We assume the underlying data to be kinetic Monte Carlo models (i.e., continuous-time Markov chains) produced from atomic sampling of point defects in locally periodic environments, such as perfect lattices, ordered surface structures or dislocation cores, possibly under the influence of a slowly varying external field. Our approach also applies to any discrete, periodic Markov chain. The analysis identifies a previously omitted non-equilibrium drift term, present even in the absence of external forces, which can compete in magnitude with the reaction rates, thus being essential to correctly capture the kinetics. To remove fast modes which hinder time integration, we use a generalized Bloch relation to efficiently calculate the eigenspectrum of the master equation. A well conditioned continuum equation then emerges by searching for spectral gaps in the long wavelength limit, using an established kinetic clustering algorithm (e.g., PCCA+) to define a proper reduced state space.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Linear Regression Games: Convergence Guarantees to Approximate Out-of-Distribution Solutions\n\n*From Search Query: convergence guarantees*\n\n*Amit Dhurandhar, Karthikeyan Shanmugam, Kartik Ahuja*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, invariant risk minimization (IRM) (Arjovsky et al.) was proposed as a promising solution to address out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization. In Ahuja et al., it was shown that solving for the Nash equilibria of a new class of \"ensemble-games\" is equivalent to solving IRM. In this work, we extend the framework in Ahuja et al. for linear regressions by projecting the ensemble-game on an $\\ell_{\\infty}$ ball. We show that such projections help achieve non-trivial OOD guarantees despite not achieving perfect invariance. For linear models with confounders, we prove that Nash equilibria of these games are closer to the ideal OOD solutions than the standard empirical risk minimization (ERM) and we also provide learning algorithms that provably converge to these Nash Equilibria. Empirical comparisons of the proposed approach with the state-of-the-art show consistent gains in achieving OOD solutions in several settings involving anti-causal variables and confounders.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals of improving autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on transformer stability, convergence, and efficiency, here are some key points and references that align with the specified keywords and details:\n\n## Mathematical Analysis of Transformer Stability Conditions\n- The paper \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" discusses various methods to improve the stability of transformer models during training. It highlights issues such as the growth of logits in attention layers and proposes solutions like layer normalization after Q and K layers, as well as after Proj and FC2 layers, to stabilize training.\n- The concept of hyperspherical parameter optimization in the \"nGPT: Normalized Transformer with Representation Learning\" paper is also relevant. This approach normalizes all vectors to lie on a unit norm hypersphere, which improves numerical stability and learning capacity by preventing weight growth and implicit weight decay.\n\n## Theoretical Frameworks for Analyzing Transformer Convergence\n- The work on \"nGPT\" provides a theoretical framework by using hyperspherical normalization, which acts as a multi-step optimizer on the hypersphere. This approach modulates updates by eigen learning rates, leading to accelerated convergence and improved stability.\n- The \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper, while not directly focused on convergence guarantees, sets the foundation for understanding the transformer architecture. However, subsequent research building on this, such as the methods discussed in \"Methods of improving LLM training stability,\" provides more specific theoretical frameworks for analyzing convergence.\n\n## Novel Stability Mechanisms in Transformer Architectures\n- The \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" paper introduces several novel stability mechanisms, including reparameterization of linear layer weights (Reparam), applying layer normalization after various layers, and using additional loss functions (e.g., z_loss) to stabilize the softmax normalizer.\n- The \"nGPT\" paper introduces hyperspherical normalization and variable-metric optimization, which are novel mechanisms that enhance stability and efficiency in transformer training.\n\n## Eigenvalue Analysis of Attention Mechanisms\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly focus on eigenvalue analysis of attention mechanisms, the \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" paper does analyze the L2 norm of outputs from linear layers, including QKV and Proj layers, which indirectly relates to the stability and eigenvalue dynamics of these layers. Further research might be needed to find specific eigenvalue analyses, but this paper sets a foundation for understanding the stability issues in these layers.\n\n## Stability-Efficiency Tradeoffs in Transformers\n- The \"nGPT\" paper highlights that the normalized transformer approach reduces the number of training steps necessary to attain the same level of accuracy, often by factors ranging from 4 to 20. This indicates a significant efficiency gain without compromising stability, as the model is less prone to overfitting and divergence.\n- The \"Methods of improving LLM training stability\" paper discusses various tradeoffs, such as the use of gradient clipping, optimizer choices (e.g., AdamW-Adafactor), and the impact of these methods on both stability and training efficiency.\n\nThese sources provide a solid foundation for understanding and improving the stability, convergence, and efficiency of autoregressive language models based on transformer architectures.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/46 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE international conference on acoustics, speech and signal processing (ICASSP), pages 4779-4783.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs for Long-memory State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/31 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n[27] Jimmy T.H.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 9168-9178.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/28 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n[11] Daniel Y.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models transformers*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Chen, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This synergistic framework L2ight is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.\n\n**Abstract:** Silicon-photonics-based optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient AI with its CMOS-compatibility, flexibility, ultra-low execution latency, and high energy efficiency. In-situ training on the online programmable photonic chips is appealing but still encounters challenging issues in on-chip implementability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework L2ight to enable scalable ONN mapping and efficient in-situ learning. L2ight adopts a three-stage learning flow that first calibrates the complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints, then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips. From a co-design perspective, L2ight also provides essential insights for hardware-restricted unitary subspace optimization and efficient sparse training.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 62  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state space models transformers*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Tuo Zhao, Eren Manavoglu, Denis Charles, Jian Jiao, Xiaodong Liu, Simiao Zuo*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient implementations of state-space models, hardware-aware optimizations, memory-efficient architectures, and stability-efficiency tradeoffs, here are some key insights and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Efficient Implementations of State-Space Models in Transformers\n\n- The paper on \"Efficient State Space Model via Fast Tensor Convolution and Block Diagonalization\" introduces an efficient state space model (eSSM) that leverages multi-input multi-output (MIMO) SSMs. This model uses convolutional representations, diagonalization, and fast tensor convolution to reduce parameter size and improve computational efficiency. This approach is particularly effective for long sequence modeling and outperforms Transformer variants in terms of parameter size and training speed.\n\n- The Mamba Neural Operator (MNO) framework combines state-space models with neural operators to solve partial differential equations (PDEs) more efficiently than traditional Transformers. MNO captures long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics effectively, making it a superior framework for tasks requiring such capabilities. This framework can be adapted to improve the efficiency of autoregressive models by leveraging the structured design of SSMs.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Neural Network Optimization Techniques\n\n- State-Space Models (SSMs) are highlighted for their efficiency and scalability, particularly in handling long sequences. The Mamba framework, for instance, achieves linear time efficiency by employing S4-based data-dependent selection techniques, which can be beneficial for hardware-aware optimizations. These models can be computed efficiently, achieving near-linear scaling in sequence length, which is crucial for real-time processing and analysis on resource-constrained hardware.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Architectures\n\n- The eSSM model reduces the number of parameters significantly compared to other models like Transformers, LSTMs, and Mamba. This reduction is achieved through block diagonalization and fast tensor convolution, making the model more memory-efficient without compromising performance.\n\n- The SC-MAMBA2 model, which integrates state-space models with the MAMBA framework, is designed to handle ultra-long transcriptome sequences efficiently. This model uses bidirectional modeling and unique design adaptations to reduce computational overhead, making it more memory-efficient for large-scale biological data.\n\n## Practical Stability-Efficiency Tradeoffs in Deep Learning\n\n- The use of state-space models provides a rigorous framework for analyzing stability and efficiency. For example, the eSSM model employs strategies like diagonalization and block diagonalization to improve both computational efficiency and model diversity, which helps in balancing stability and expressivity.\n\n- The integration of control theory principles, such as those seen in the Mamba Neural Operator, can offer new optimization opportunities and stability mechanisms. This approach can help in analyzing and improving the convergence of autoregressive models, ensuring a better stability-efficiency tradeoff.\n\nIn summary, the key strategies to improve autoregressive language model design include:\n\n- **Efficient State-Space Models**: Utilize MIMO SSMs with convolutional representations and advanced techniques like diagonalization and fast tensor convolution to reduce parameters and improve efficiency.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Leverage frameworks like Mamba that achieve linear time efficiency and near-linear scaling in sequence length, making them suitable for resource-constrained hardware.\n- **Memory-Efficient Architectures**: Implement models with reduced parameter sizes, such as eSSM and SC-MAMBA2, which maintain performance while being more memory-efficient.\n- **Stability-Efficiency Tradeoffs**: Apply control theory principles and analyze stability using tools like eigenspectrum analysis to ensure a balanced tradeoff between stability and efficiency.\n",

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/29 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nHere we discuss the most prominent one. S6. The first selective SSM parametrization (S6) was introduced together with the Mamba architecture Gu and Dao, 2023]. The S6 block parametrizes the recurrence as\n\n$$\nA_{i}=e^{-\\Delta_{i} A}, \\quad B_{i}=\\Delta_{i} W_{B} u_{i}, \\quad C_{i}=W_{C} u_{i}, \\quad D_{i}=W_{D} u_{i}\n$$\n\nwith $\\Delta_{i}=\\operatorname{softplus}\\left(W_{\\Delta}\\left(W_{u} u_{i}\\right)+b_{\\Delta}\\right)$ for every $i, W_{\\Delta}, W_{u}, W_{B}, W_{C}, W_{D}, A$ are learnt matrices of appropriate dimensions, and $b_{\\Delta}$ is a learnt bias. While SSM models allow for complex-valued matrices $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$, here we restrict ourselves to real-valued matrices as in Gu and Dao, 2023]. ### 2.3 Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nSimilar to SSMs, RNNs also parameterize the input-output relationship via a recurrent computation, commonly given by the long short-term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997], at each time step $i$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{i} & =f_{i} \\odot x_{i-1}+i_{i} \\odot \\bar{u}_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =o_{i} \\odot \\tanh \\left(x_{i}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{u}_{i}$ represents the pre-processed raw input $u_{i}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{i}=\\tanh \\left(W_{u} u_{i}+U_{u} y_{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $f_{i}, i_{i}$, and $o_{i}$ are the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate, respectively,\n\n$$\nf_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{f} u_{i}+U_{f} y_{i-1}\\right), \\quad i_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{i} u_{i}+U_{i} y_{i-1}\\right), \\quad o_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{o} u_{i}+U_{o} y_{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{f}, W_{i}, W_{o}$ and $U_{f}, U_{i}, U_{o}$ are the learnt gate parameters. In this paper, we focus on two variants: quasi LSTMs (qLSTM) [Stani\u0107 et al. 2023], which removes the output dependence of the gates, and RG-LRU [De et al. 2024], which attempts to integrate ideas from SSMs into RNNs. qLSTM. The qLSTM model is parameterized by recurrence (5) with pre-processed input $\\bar{u}_{i}$ and gates $f_{i}, i_{i}, o_{i}$ :\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{i}=\\tanh \\left(W_{u} u_{i}\\right), \\quad f_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{f} u_{i}\\right), \\quad i_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{i} u_{i}\\right), \\quad o_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{o} u_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nRG-LRU. The RG-LRU model presents a hybrid between a qLSTM and a SSM.

We use this to rewrite the parametrizations in a common framework and provide detailed comparisons. ### 3.1 Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF)\n\nThe DSF relies on a dynamical systems representation of the architectures. As is standard in RNN and SSM literature, we choose a recurrent state space representation. In particular, a linear structured time-varying (LTV) dynamical system is defined by the recurrence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_{i} & =\\Lambda_{i} h_{i-1}+B_{i} u_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =C_{i} h_{i}+D_{i} u_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is the hidden state initialized with $h_{-1}=0, \\Lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is the diagonal state transition matrix, $B_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and $C_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}$ are the input and output matrices, respectively, and $D_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ is a scaled skip connection. Dynamical system (11) can alternatively be written in its convolutional representation, i.e., $\\mathbf{y}=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi u}$, where the convolutional kernel $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nC_{0} B_{0}+D_{0} & & & \\\\\nC_{1} \\Lambda_{1} B_{0} & C_{1} B_{1}+D_{1} & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\nC_{L} \\prod_{k=1}^{L} \\Lambda_{k} B_{0} & \\ldots & C_{L} \\Lambda_{L} B_{L-1} & C_{L} B_{L}+D_{L}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the convolution kernel $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ is of the same dimension as the attention matrix $\\zeta\\left(\\mathbf{q} \\mathbf{k}^{\\top}\\right)$ and that these matrices are equivalent, up to the scaling factor $W_{V}$ used in self-attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid ssm attention architectures, stability analysis transformers, hardware efficient neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

These models undergo two stages of training: pretraining on a huge corpus of data and fine-tuning on a specific downstream task. The pretraining phase is extremely compute-intensive and requires several high-performance computing devices like GPUs and several days or even months of training, but it is crucial for the model to capture global knowledge and also has a significant impact on the fine-tuning task. This is a major roadblock for researchers without access to sophisticated computing resources. To overcome this challenge, we propose two novel hybrid architectures called HybridBERT (HBERT), which combine self-attention and additive attention mechanisms together with sub-layer normalization. We introduce a computing budget to the pretraining phase, limiting the training time and usage to a single GPU. We show that HBERT attains twice the pretraining accuracy of a vanilla-BERT baseline. We also evaluate our proposed models on two downstream tasks, where we outperform BERT-base while accelerating inference.

CoAtNet: Marrying Convolution and Attention for All Data Sizes\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid ssm attention architectures*\n\n*Zihang Dai, Hanxiao Liu, Quoc V. Le, Mingxing Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents CoAtNets, a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention and (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have attracted increasing interests in computer vision, but they still fall behind state-of-the-art convolutional networks. In this work, we show that while Transformers tend to have larger model capacity, their generalization can be worse than convolutional networks due to the lack of the right inductive bias. To effectively combine the strengths from both architectures, we present CoAtNets(pronounced\"coat\"nets), a family of hybrid models built from two key insights: (1) depthwise Convolution and self-Attention can be naturally unified via simple relative attention; (2) vertically stacking convolution layers and attention layers in a principled way is surprisingly effective in improving generalization, capacity and efficiency. Experiments show that our CoAtNets achieve state-of-the-art performance under different resource constraints across various datasets: Without extra data, CoAtNet achieves 86.0% ImageNet top-1 accuracy; When pre-trained with 13M images from ImageNet-21K, our CoAtNet achieves 88.56% top-1 accuracy, matching ViT-huge pre-trained with 300M images from JFT-300M while using 23x less data; Notably, when we further scale up CoAtNet with JFT-3B, it achieves 90.88% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, establishing a new state-of-the-art result.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 991  (*Influential: 105*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis transformers*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we improve upon recent analysis of Transformers and formalize a notion of sensitivity to capture the difficulty of training. Sensitivity characterizes how the variance of activation and gradient norms change in expectation when parameters are randomly perturbed. We analyze the sensitivity of previous Transformer architectures and design a new architecture, the Catformer, which replaces residual connections or RNN-based gating mechanisms with concatenation. We prove that Catformers are less sensitive than other Transformer variants and demonstrate that this leads to more stable training. On DMLab30, a suite of high-dimension reinforcement tasks, Catformer outperforms other transformers, including Gated Transformer-XL\u2014the state-of-the-art architecture designed to address stability\u2014by 13%.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Transformers Learn Nonlinear Features In Context: Nonconvex Mean-field Dynamics on the Attention Landscape\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis transformers*\n\n*Juno Kim, Taiji Suzuki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper studies the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer, and proves in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models based on the Transformer architecture have demonstrated impressive capabilities to learn in context. However, existing theoretical studies on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient neural networks*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Generalized Depthwise-Separable Convolutions for Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient neural networks*\n\n*Hassan Dbouk, Naresh R Shanbhag*\n\n**TL;DR:** The method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution is proposed -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution that dramatically improves the throughput of aStandard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their tremendous successes, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) incur high computational/storage costs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent works on robust model compression address these challenges by combining model compression techniques with adversarial training. But these methods are unable to improve throughput (frames-per-second) on real-life hardware while simultaneously preserving robustness to adversarial perturbations. To overcome this problem, we propose the method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution. GDWS dramatically improves the throughput of a standard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness. Lastly, GDWS is scalable to large problem sizes since it operates on pre-trained models and doesn't require any additional training. We establish the optimality of GDWS as a 2D convolution approximator and present exact algorithms for constructing optimal GDWS convolutions under complexity and error constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDWS via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets.

Our algorithm is general, as it applies to arbitrary (unstructured) sparsity and common layer types (e.g., convolutional or linear). We provide a fast vectorized implementation on commodity CPUs, and show that it can yield speedups in end-to-end runtime experiments, both in transfer learning using already-sparsified networks, and in training sparse networks from scratch. Thus, our results provide the first support for sparse training on commodity hardware.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid ssm attention architectures*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid ssm attention architectures*\n\n*ChengXiang Zhai, Chenguang Zhu, Yichong Xu, Shuohang Wang, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with self-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range of sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks at both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on sequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence modeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.

DeepNet: Scaling Transformers to 1,000 Layers\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis transformers*\n\n*Furu Wei, Dongdong Zhang, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective method to stabilize extremely deep Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a new normalization function (DeepNorm) to modify the residual connection in Transformer, accompanying with theoretically derived initialization. In-depth theoretical analysis shows that model updates can be bounded in a stable way. The proposed method combines the best of two worlds, i.e., good performance of Post-LN and stable training of Pre-LN, making DeepNorm a preferred alternative. We successfully scale Transformers up to 1,000 layers (i.e., 2,500 attention and feed-forward network sublayers) without difficulty, which is one order of magnitude deeper than previous deep Transformers. Remarkably, on a multilingual benchmark with 7,482 translation directions, our 200-layer model with 3.2B parameters significantly outperforms the 48-layer state-of-the-art model with 12B parameters by 5 BLEU points, which indicates a promising scaling direction.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Lumina-T2X: Transforming Text into Any Modality, Resolution, and Duration via Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis transformers*\n\n*Rongjie Huang, Longtian Qiu, Dongyang Liu, Hongsheng Li, Yu Qiao, Jingwen He, He Tong, Weicai Ye, Tianshuo Yang, Zhengkai Jiang, Wenqi Shao, Junlin Xi, Renrui Zhang, Shijie Geng, Chen Lin, Yuhang Zhang, Xu Luo, Ruoyi Du, Le Zhuo, Peng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Sora unveils the potential of scaling Diffusion Transformer for generating photorealistic images and videos at arbitrary resolutions, aspect ratios, and durations, yet it still lacks sufficient implementation details. In this technical report, we introduce the Lumina-T2X family - a series of Flow-based Large Diffusion Transformers (Flag-DiT) equipped with zero-initialized attention, as a unified framework designed to transform noise into images, videos, multi-view 3D objects, and audio clips conditioned on text instructions. By tokenizing the latent spatial-temporal space and incorporating learnable placeholders such as [nextline] and [nextframe] tokens, Lumina-T2X seamlessly unifies the representations of different modalities across various spatial-temporal resolutions. This unified approach enables training within a single framework for different modalities and allows for flexible generation of multimodal data at any resolution, aspect ratio, and length during inference. Advanced techniques like RoPE, RMSNorm, and flow matching enhance the stability, flexibility, and scalability of Flag-DiT, enabling models of Lumina-T2X to scale up to 7 billion parameters and extend the context window to 128K tokens. This is particularly beneficial for creating ultra-high-definition images with our Lumina-T2I model and long 720p videos with our Lumina-T2V model. Remarkably, Lumina-T2I, powered by a 5-billion-parameter Flag-DiT, requires only 35% of the training computational costs of a 600-million-parameter naive DiT. Our further comprehensive analysis underscores Lumina-T2X's preliminary capability in resolution extrapolation, high-resolution editing, generating consistent 3D views, and synthesizing videos with seamless transitions. We expect that the open-sourcing of Lumina-T2X will further foster creativity, transparency, and diversity in the generative AI community.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-09\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Pixelwise Classification on Heterogeneous Hardware Systems\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient neural networks*\n\n*Fabian Tschopp*\n\n**Abstract:** This work presents and analyzes three convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodels for efficient pixelwise classification of images. When using\nconvolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole\nimage, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding\nwindow networks. This set of new architectures solve this issue by either\nremoving redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that\ninherently predict many pixels at once.\n  The implementations of the three models are accessible through a new utility\non top of the Caffe library. The utility provides support for a wide range of\nimage input and output formats, pre-processing parameters and methods to\nequalize the label histogram during training. The Caffe library has been\nextended by new layers and a new backend for availability on a wider range of\nhardware such as CPUs and GPUs through OpenCL.\n  On AMD GPUs, speedups of $54\\times$ (SK-Net), $437\\times$ (U-Net) and\n$320\\times$ (USK-Net) have been observed, taking the SK equivalent SW (sliding\nwindow) network as the baseline. The label throughput is up to one megapixel\nper second.\n  The analyzed neural networks have distinctive characteristics that apply\nduring training or processing, and not every data set is suitable to every\narchitecture. The quality of the predictions is assessed on two neural tissue\ndata sets, of which one is the ISBI 2012 challenge data set.

These models leverage the complementary features of SSMs and attention layers, where SSMs provide efficient sequence-to-sequence mapping capabilities and attention layers offer fast retrieval properties. This hybrid approach has been shown to outperform pure Transformer or SSM models in various tasks.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Stability in Neural Architectures\n\n- Theoretical stability in hybrid architectures can be analyzed using control theory and Hankel operator theory. For instance, the work on \"There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs\" introduces a new parameterization scheme using Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which helps in improving training stability by allowing for random initializations of the Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems.\n- SSMs inherently provide a theoretical framework for stability analysis due to their roots in control theory, which can be crucial for ensuring the stability of hybrid models.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Adaptive Mechanisms\n\n- The \"Falcon Mamba\" model demonstrates hardware-efficient implementations by leveraging the theoretical efficiency of SSMs in handling large sequences. This model uses a \"Sequential Prefill\" method to process prompts token by token, mitigating memory scaling issues and enabling the processing of arbitrarily long prompts without significant memory overhead.\n- The use of block-wise processing and structured sparsity can also enhance hardware efficiency. For example, \"Block-State Transformers\" combine an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization with a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation, aligning well with hardware capabilities.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Deep Learning\n\n- Memory optimization is a critical aspect, especially for long sequence processing. The \"Falcon Mamba\" model shows that SSMs do not require key-value (KV) caching, which reduces memory usage compared to Transformers. Additionally, the \"Sequential Prefill\" method helps in managing memory efficiently by processing prompts in chunks.\n- Hybrid models like \"Zamba2-7B\" achieve a significantly smaller memory footprint than comparable Transformer-based models, making them more memory-efficient.\n\n## Convergence Guarantees in Deep Architectures\n\n- Convergence guarantees can be enhanced through the use of stable parameterization schemes. The work on \"There is HOPE to Avoid HiPPOs\" provides a unified initialization approach using Hankel operators, which helps in ensuring stable training and convergence.\n- The stability provided by SSMs, rooted in control theory, also offers mathematical guarantees for convergence, which is essential for reliable and robust model performance.\n\n### Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining SSMs with attention layers can leverage the strengths of both, improving performance and efficiency.\n- **Stability Analysis**: Using control theory and Hankel operator theory can provide robust stability guarantees.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Techniques like block-wise processing, structured sparsity, and IO-aware algorithm design are crucial for efficient implementations.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Methods such as \"Sequential Prefill\" and avoiding KV caching can significantly reduce memory usage.\n- **Convergence Guarantees**: Stable parameterization schemes and mathematical foundations from control theory ensure reliable convergence.\n\nThese insights and references should help researchers in designing more efficient, stable, and scalable autoregressive language models.\n",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model when released, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self-attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity $\\mathcal{O}\\left(T^{2}\\right)$ to linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(T)$ with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining $32.2 \\times$ fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 3. Large Memory Layers with Product Keys (Avg. Score: 0.35)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/51 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn Gurevych, I. and Miyao, Y.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

Unraveling Feature Extraction Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective activation mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xiaobing Sun, Jiaxi Li, Wei Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Considering the infinite network width, it is hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening insights into their internal mechanisms and aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying mechanism of neural networks in capturing precise knowledge has been the subject of consistent research efforts. In this work, we propose a theoretical approach based on Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) to investigate such mechanisms. Specifically, considering the infinite network width, we hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening our insights into their internal mechanisms. We apply our approach to several fundamental models and reveal how these models leverage statistical features during gradient descent and how they are integrated into final decisions. We also discovered that the choice of activation function can affect feature extraction. For instance, the use of the \\textit{ReLU} activation function could potentially introduce a bias in features, providing a plausible explanation for its replacement with alternative functions in recent pre-trained language models. Additionally, we find that while self-attention and CNN models may exhibit limitations in learning n-grams, multiplication-based models seem to excel in this area. We verify these theoretical findings through experiments and find that they can be applied to analyze language modeling tasks, which can be regarded as a special variant of classification.

PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective activation mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

We approach this problem through the unconventional angle of \\textit{cognitive abstraction mechanisms}, drawing inspiration from recent neuroscience work, allowing us to define the Cognitive Neural Activation metric (CNA) for DNNs, which is the correlation between information complexity (entropy) of given input and the concentration of higher activation values in deeper layers of the network. The CNA is highly predictive of generalization ability, outperforming norm-and-margin-based generalization metrics on an extensive evaluation of over 100 dataset-and-network-architecture combinations, especially in cases where additive noise is present and/or training labels are corrupted. These strong empirical results show the usefulness of CNA as a generalization metric, and encourage further research on the connection between information complexity and representations in the deeper layers of networks in order to better understand the generalization capabilities of DNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Privacy Induces Robustness: Information-Computation Gaps and Sparse Mean Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation efficiency*\n\n*Kristian Georgiev, Samuel B. Hopkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We establish a simple connection between robust and differentially-private algorithms: private mechanisms which perform well with very high probability are automatically robust in the sense that they retain accuracy even if a constant fraction of the samples they receive are adversarially corrupted. Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities, our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics problems are robust. We investigate the consequences of this observation for both algorithms and computational complexity across different statistical problems. Assuming the Brennan-Bresler secret-leakage planted clique conjecture, we demonstrate a fundamental tradeoff between computational efficiency, privacy leakage, and success probability for sparse mean estimation. Private algorithms which match this tradeoff are not yet known -- we achieve that (up to polylogarithmic factors) in a polynomially-large range of parameters via the Sum-of-Squares method. To establish an information-computation gap for private sparse mean estimation, we also design new (exponential-time) mechanisms using fewer samples than efficient algorithms must use. Finally, we give evidence for privacy-induced information-computation gaps for several other statistics and learning problems, including PAC learning parity functions and estimation of the mean of a multivariate Gaussian.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Personalized Federated Learning via Sparse Model-Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation efficiency*\n\n*Daoyuan Chen, Liuyi Yao, Dawei Gao, Bolin Ding, Yaliang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel approach named pFedGate, which achieves superior global accuracy, individual accuracy and efficiency simultaneously over state-of-the-art methods for efficient personalized FL by adaptively and efficiently learning sparse local models.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated Learning (FL) aims to train machine learning models for multiple clients without sharing their own private data. Due to the heterogeneity of clients' local data distribution, recent studies explore the personalized FL that learns and deploys distinct local models with the help of auxiliary global models. However, the clients can be heterogeneous in terms of not only local data distribution, but also their computation and communication resources. The capacity and efficiency of personalized models are restricted by the lowest-resource clients, leading to sub-optimal performance and limited practicality of personalized FL. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach named pFedGate for efficient personalized FL by adaptively and efficiently learning sparse local models. With a lightweight trainable gating layer, pFedGate enables clients to reach their full potential in model capacity by generating different sparse models accounting for both the heterogeneous data distributions and resource constraints. Meanwhile, the computation and communication efficiency are both improved thanks to the adaptability between the model sparsity and clients' resources. Further, we theoretically show that the proposed pFedGate has superior complexity with guaranteed convergence and generalization error. Extensive experiments show that pFedGate achieves superior global accuracy, individual accuracy and efficiency simultaneously over state-of-the-art methods. We also demonstrate that pFedGate performs better than competitors in the novel clients participation and partial clients participation scenarios, and can learn meaningful sparse local models adapted to different data distributions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6.

Therefore, we present a novel method of Bi-directional Masks (Bi-Mask) with its two central innovations in: 1) Separate sparse masks in the two directions of forward and backward propagation to obtain training acceleration. It disentangles the forward and backward weight sparsity and overcomes the very dense gradient computation. 2) An efficient weight row permutation method to maintain performance. It picks up the permutation candidate with the most eligible N:M weight blocks in the backward to minimize the gradient gap between traditional uni-directional masks and our bi-directional masks. Compared with existing uni-directional scenario that applies a transposable mask and enables backward acceleration, our Bi-Mask is experimentally demonstrated to be more superior in performance.

While the tensor computation in top-of-the-line GPUs increased by 32x over the last five years, the total available memory only grew by 2.5x. This prevents researchers from exploring larger architectures, as training large networks requires more memory for storing intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present MONeT, an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks. MONeT jointly optimizes the checkpointing schedule and the implementation of various operators. MONeT is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing. MONeT reduces the overall memory requirement by 3x for various PyTorch models, with a 9-16% overhead in computation.

Exploring the Limits of Differentially Private Deep Learning with Group-wise Clipping\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization deep learning*\n\n*Jiyan He, Xuechen Li, Da Yu, Huishuai Zhang, Janardhan Kulkarni, Y. Lee, A. Backurs, Nenghai Yu, J. Bian*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that per-layer clipping, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization, which results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Differentially private deep learning has recently witnessed advances in computational efficiency and privacy-utility trade-off. We explore whether further improvements along the two axes are possible and provide affirmative answers leveraging two instantiations of \\emph{group-wise clipping}. To reduce the compute time overhead of private learning, we show that \\emph{per-layer clipping}, where the gradient of each neural network layer is clipped separately, allows clipping to be performed in conjunction with backpropagation in differentially private optimization. This results in private learning that is as memory-efficient and almost as fast per training update as non-private learning for many workflows of interest. While per-layer clipping with constant thresholds tends to underperform standard flat clipping, per-layer clipping with adaptive thresholds matches or outperforms flat clipping under given training epoch constraints, hence attaining similar or better task performance within less wall time. To explore the limits of scaling (pretrained) models in differentially private deep learning, we privately fine-tune the 175 billion-parameter GPT-3. We bypass scaling challenges associated with clipping gradients that are distributed across multiple devices with \\emph{per-device clipping} that clips the gradient of each model piece separately on its host device. Privately fine-tuning GPT-3 with per-device clipping achieves a task performance at $\\epsilon=1$ better than what is attainable by non-privately fine-tuning the largest GPT-2 on a summarization task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 9. MCUNet: Tiny Deep Learning on IoT Devices\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization deep learning*\n\n*Ji Lin, Wei-Ming Chen, Yujun Lin, J. Cohn, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** MCUNet, a framework that jointly designs the efficient neural architecture (T TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcontrollers, is proposed, suggesting that the era of always-on tiny machine learning on IoT devices has arrived.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning on tiny IoT devices based on microcontroller units (MCU) is appealing but challenging: the memory of microcontrollers is 2-3 orders of magnitude less even than mobile phones. We propose MCUNet, a framework that jointly designs the efficient neural architecture (TinyNAS) and the lightweight inference engine (TinyEngine), enabling ImageNet-scale inference on microcontrollers. TinyNAS adopts a two-stage neural architecture search approach that first optimizes the search space to fit the resource constraints, then specializes the network architecture in the optimized search space. TinyNAS can automatically handle diverse constraints (i.e. device, latency, energy, memory) under low search costs. TinyNAS is co-designed with TinyEngine, a memory-efficient inference library to expand the design space and fit a larger model. TinyEngine adapts the memory scheduling according to the overall network topology rather than layer-wise optimization, reducing the memory usage by 2.7x, and accelerating the inference by 1.7-3.3x compared to TF-Lite Micro and CMSIS-NN. MCUNet is the first to achieves >70% ImageNet top1 accuracy on an off-the-shelf commercial microcontroller, using 3.6x less SRAM and 6.6x less Flash compared to quantized MobileNetV2 and ResNet-18. On visual&audio wake words tasks, MCUNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and runs 2.4-3.4x faster than MobileNetV2 and ProxylessNAS-based solutions with 2.2-2.6x smaller peak SRAM. Our study suggests that the era of always-on tiny machine learning on IoT devices has arrived.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 402  (*Influential: 59*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Can Active Memory Replace Attention?\n\n*From Search Query: selective activation mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts\nof its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in\nrecent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning,\nspeech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it\nhad probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.\n  Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative\nmechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of\nit in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory,\nimproved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in\ngenerative modelling.\n  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most\nnatural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We\nanalyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active\nmemory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and\ngeneralizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain\nwhy previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when\nactive memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.\n\n**Conference:** can-active-memory-replace-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Pay attention to the activations: a modular attention mechanism for fine-grained image recognition\n\n*From Search Query: selective activation mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Jordi Gonz\u00e0lez Sabat\u00e9, Josep M. Gonfaus, Guillem Cucurull Preixens, Pau Rodr\u00edguez L\u00f3pez, F. Xavier Roca Marva, Diego Velazquez Dorta*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-grained image recognition is central to many multimedia tasks such as search, retrieval and captioning. Unfortunately, these tasks are still challenging since the appearance of samples of the same class can be more different than those from different classes. Attention has been typically implemented in neural networks by selecting the most informative regions of the image that improve classification. In contrast, in this paper, attention is not applied at the image level but to the convolutional feature activations. In essence, with our approach, the neural model learns to attend to lower-level feature activations without requiring part annotations and uses those activations to update and rectify the output likelihood distribution. The proposed mechanism is modular, architecture-independent and efficient in terms of both parameters and computation required. Experiments demonstrate that well-known networks such as Wide Residual Networks and ResNeXt, when augmented with our approach, systematically improve their classification accuracy and become more robust to changes in deformation and pose and to the presence of clutter. As a result, our proposal reaches state-of-the-art classification accuracies in CIFAR-10, the Adience gender recognition task, Stanford Dogs, and UEC-Food100 while obtaining competitive performance in ImageNet, CIFAR-100, CUB200 Birds, and Stanford Cars. In addition, we analyze the different components of our model, showing that the proposed attention modules succeed in finding the most discriminative regions of the image. Finally, as a proof of concept, we demonstrate that with only local predictions, an augmented neural network can successfully classify an image before reaching any fully connected layer, thus reducing the computational amount up to 10%.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. Computationally Efficient Sparse Bayesian Learning via Generalized Approximate Message Passing\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation efficiency*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The sparse Beyesian learning (also referred to as Bayesian compressed\nsensing) algorithm is one of the most popular approaches for sparse signal\nrecovery, and has demonstrated superior performance in a series of experiments.\nNevertheless, the sparse Bayesian learning algorithm has computational\ncomplexity that grows exponentially with the dimension of the signal, which\nhinders its application to many practical problems even with moderately large\ndata sets. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a computationally\nefficient sparse Bayesian learning method via the generalized approximate\nmessage passing (GAMP) technique. Specifically, the algorithm is developed\nwithin an expectation-maximization (EM) framework, using GAMP to efficiently\ncompute an approximation of the posterior distribution of hidden variables. The\nhyperparameters associated with the hierarchical Gaussian prior are learned by\niteratively maximizing the Q-function which is calculated based on the\nposterior approximation obtained from the GAMP. Numerical results are provided\nto illustrate the computational efficacy and the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm.\n\n**Published:** 2015-01-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Scalable Training of Artificial Neural Networks with Adaptive Sparse Connectivity inspired by Network Science\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation efficiency*\n\n*Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Madeleine Gibescu, Antonio Liotta, Phuong H. Nguyen, Elena Mocanu, Peter Stone*\n\n**Abstract:** Through the success of deep learning in various domains, artificial neural\nnetworks are currently among the most used artificial intelligence methods.\nTaking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks\n(e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice)\nartificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here\nwe propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an\nalgorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random\ngraph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during\nlearning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers\nwith sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of\nparameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on\nrestricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional\nneural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets. Our\napproach has the potential to enable artificial neural networks to scale up\nbeyond what is currently possible.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. Accelerating SLIDE Deep Learning on Modern CPUs: Vectorization, Quantizations, Memory Optimizations, and More\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization deep learning*\n\n*Anshumali Shrivastava, Charlie Tai, Sameh Gobriel, Yong Wu, Mengnan Zhao, Nicholas Meisburger, Shabnam Daghaghi*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning implementations on CPUs (Central Processing Units) are gaining more traction. Enhanced AI capabilities on commodity x86 architectures are commercially appealing due to the reuse of existing hardware and virtualization ease. A notable work in this direction is the SLIDE system. SLIDE is a C++ implementation of a sparse hash table based back-propagation, which was shown to be significantly faster than GPUs in training hundreds of million parameter neural models. In this paper, we argue that SLIDE's current implementation is sub-optimal and does not exploit several opportunities available in modern CPUs. In particular, we show how SLIDE's computations allow for a unique possibility of vectorization via AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)-512. Furthermore, we highlight opportunities for different kinds of memory optimization and quantizations. Combining all of them, we obtain up to 7x speedup in the computations on the same hardware. Our experiments are focused on large (hundreds of millions of parameters) recommendation and NLP models. Our work highlights several novel perspectives and opportunities for implementing randomized algorithms for deep learning on modern CPUs.

Memory Augmented Optimizers for Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization deep learning*\n\n*Sarath Chandar, Mahmoud Assran, Prasanna Parthasarathi, Paul-Aymeric McRae*\n\n**Abstract:** Popular approaches for minimizing loss in data-driven learning often involve an abstraction or an explicit retention of the history of gradients for efficient parameter updates. The aggregated history of gradients nudges the parameter updates in the right direction even when the gradients at any given step are not informative. Although the history of gradients summarized in meta-parameters or explicitly stored in memory has been shown effective in theory and practice, the question of whether $all$ or only a subset of the gradients in the history are sufficient in deciding the parameter updates remains unanswered. In this paper, we propose a framework of memory-augmented gradient descent optimizers that retain a limited view of their gradient history in their internal memory. Such optimizers scale well to large real-life datasets, and our experiments show that the memory augmented extensions of standard optimizers enjoy accelerated convergence and improved performance on a majority of computer vision and language tasks that we considered. Additionally, we prove that the proposed class of optimizers with fixed-size memory converge under assumptions of strong convexity, regardless of which gradients are selected or how they are linearly combined to form the update step.\n\n**Conference:** memory-augmented-optimizers-for-deep-learning-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on selective activation mechanisms, efficient sparse computation, memory optimization, and hardware-efficient implementation, here are some relevant insights and references:\n\n## Selective Activation Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n- The concept of selective activation is crucial for balancing computation and memory. The \"Sparse Modular Activation\" approach by Zhai et al. (2023) is particularly relevant, as it enables neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. This method can be adapted to autoregressive LMs to reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance.\n\n## Efficient Sparse Computation Techniques\n\n- The paper on \"Solving Continual Offline RL through Selective Weights Activation\" introduces the Vector-Quantized Continual Diffuser (VQ-CD) method, which includes a selective weights activation diffuser (SWA) module. This module selectively activates different parameters of the diffusion model to reduce catastrophic forgetting and reserve disengaged weights for ongoing tasks. This technique can be generalized to other neural network architectures, including LMs, to improve sparse computation efficiency.\n\n## Memory Optimization Strategies for Deep Learning\n\n- Memory hierarchy optimization is essential for efficient LM design. The \"Samba\" approach by Chen et al. (2024) selectively compresses sequences into recurrent hidden states while maintaining the ability to recall memories with attention mechanisms. This selective compression can help in optimizing memory usage, especially in hybrid architectures that combine state space models (SSMs) with transformers.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementation of Sparse Operations\n\n- Structured sparsity and IO-aware algorithm design are critical for hardware efficiency. The \"Block-State Transformers\" by Fathi et al. (2023) combine SSMs with attention mechanisms, enabling block-wise processing that aligns well with hardware capabilities. This design can be optimized further by incorporating structured sparsity to improve hardware utilization.\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity in Neural Architectures\n\n- Dynamic sparsity can be achieved through mechanisms like those described in \"Sparse Modular Activation\" by Zhai et al. (2023). This approach allows neural networks to dynamically activate sub-modules based on the input sequence, which can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive LMs where different parts of the model may be more or less relevant depending on the context.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms, as seen in \"Block-State Transformers\" and \"Samba,\" can leverage the strengths of both architectures while allowing for selective activation and efficient computation.\n- **Stability and Control Theory**: Ensuring stability in these hybrid models is crucial. Theoretical frameworks like those presented in \"Transformers as Algorithms\" by Li et al. (2023) can provide mathematical foundations for stability analysis, which is essential for reliable performance.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop autoregressive LMs that are not only efficient in terms of computation and memory but also scalable and robust, aligning with the goals of achieving low perplexity, high accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.\n",

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 2. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds.

However, as previously discussed, this Monte Carlo-based approximation method cannot achieve satisfactory outcomes, resulting in accuracy loss. By switching from Monte Carlo to the Quasi-Monte Carlo scheme using Positive Fixed Features (PFF) as described in Equation 9, we surpassed the accuracy of Performer but still fell short of the original vanilla Transformer's performance. Furthermore, by incorporating the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), our method achieves higher efficiency than approaches using PFF kernels. The DCT transformation enables a more compact and efficient representation of the frequency components of the attention mechanism. This efficiency stems from the DCT's ability to concentrate energy, allowing for a sparse representation that captures the most significant features of the data with fewer coefficients. Consequently, our approach not only closely approximates the original attention but also does so with improved computational performance compared to PFF-based methods. This advantage highlights the effectiveness of using DCT in optimizing the approximation of attention mechanisms, further underscoring the potential of our method in enhancing the efficiency of Transformer models. Further incorporating weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo, our DiJiang architecture ultimately achieved accuracy nearly identical to the original Pythia- 400 M , validating the efficacy of our approximation method. This demonstrates not only the potential of our approach for fine-tuning large-scale language models but also underscores the importance of choosing an efficient approximation strategy to maintain model performance. We further visualized the training curves to showcase the approximation efficiency of different linear Transformer models, as depicted in Figure 2. RetNet, as an emerging language model architecture, has shown its potential by achieving significantly low loss values, underscoring its\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_7edc096661daf8d487e6g-07.jpg?height=695&width=790&top_left_y=994&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2. Training Curve of different methods. The proposed method achieves the lowest PPL and the fastest converge speed. capability for language tasks. Despite its low loss, RetNet does not necessarily outperform on benchmark metrics and, in some cases, even falls short of the results achieved by the Performer. This discrepancy highlights the importance and advantages of employing kernel methods to approximate the original attention computation, particularly in fine-tuning scenarios. Our method demonstrates the fastest rate of loss reduction and ultimately achieves the lowest loss value. This rapid convergence indicates that our approach can quickly reach a performance level similar to that of the original Transformer. The visualization clearly underscores the superiority of our method in terms of both convergence speed and final model accuracy, validating our approach's effectiveness in efficiently approximating the attention mechanism\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_7edc096661daf8d487e6g-08.jpg?height=541&width=1605&top_left_y=251&top_left_x=227)\n\nFigure 3.

Comparison of inference memory and throughput between the proposed DiJIang and vanilla Transformer architecture. while maintaining high performance standards. This visual evidence further solidifies our claim that our method stands out among linear Transformer alternatives, offering a compelling solution for optimizing Transformer models without compromising on quality. ### 4.4. Comparison of Inference Cost\n\nFurthermore, we also evaluated the memory usage and throughput of our method in comparison to the original Transformer model under various conditions. We selected the Pythia-410M model as our primary subject for analysis. We follow the implementation of RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) to efficient inference. The specific results, as depicted in Figure 4, demonstrate that as the token length increases, the memory footprint and inference speed of our model do not escalate. This observation is attributed to the linear complexity characteristic of our approach, indicating that our method is more conducive to long-sequence inference. In contrast, due to the quadratic complexity of attention computations, the original Transformer model experiences a continuous increase in both inference time and required memory as the token length grows. This comparison highlights the efficiency and practicality of our solution, particularly in scenarios involving extensive sequences where computational resources are a critical concern. ### 4.5. Visualization\n\nTo further demonstrate the effectiveness of our model's approximation of the attention mechanism, we present attention maps generated by different methods in Figure 3. It is evident that the original Transformer's attention map (Figure 3 (a)) is rich in information, laying the foundation for its robust capabilities. In contrast, attention maps produced by other linear attention methods such as Performer (Figure 3 (b)) fail to adequately capture the relationships between tokens, resulting in maps that are dissimilar to those of the original Transformer and ultimately leading to decreased model accuracy, despite fine-tuning efforts. In contrast, our method (Figure 3 (c)), by employing the weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo scheme, closely approximates the original attention mechanism. This allows it to effectively model the relationships between different tokens, achieving results nearly identical to those of the original Transformer but\nwith significantly faster inference efficiency. This comparison not only highlights the inadequacies of other linear attention methods in capturing token interdependencies but also showcases the superiority of our approach in accurately approximating attention while enhancing computational efficiency. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nThis paper introduces DiJiang, a groundbreaking Frequency Domain Kernelization method designed to address the computational inefficiencies inherent in traditional Transformer models. By leveraging linear attention mechanisms and a novel application of the weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for efficient sampling, our approach significantly reduces the necessity for extensive retraining. This is particularly beneficial for large language models, where the cost and time associated with training are substantial barriers to progress. The kernelization process, underpinned by Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), not only diminishes the computational complexity but also ensures that the adaptation from a vanilla Transformer to a linear attention model incurs minimal training costs. Our extensive experiments validate that DiJiang achieves performance on par with conventional Transformers while reducing training costs by about 10x and enhancing inference speeds. This method represents a significant advancement in the development of efficient and scalable Transformer models, promising wider applicability and facilitating advancements in various tasks within the realm of natural language processing and beyond. ## Broader Impact\n\nThis paper presents work whose goal is to advance the field of Machine Learning.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/30 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Score: 0.73)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/29 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\n1990.

Score: 0.62)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

After deriving its properties, we show how its Jacobian can be efficiently computed, enabling its use in a network trained with backpropagation. Then, we propose a new smooth and convex loss function which is the sparsemax analogue of the logistic loss. We reveal an unexpected connection between this new loss and the Huber classification loss. We obtain promising empirical results in multi-label classification problems and in attention-based neural networks for natural language inference. For the latter, we achieve a similar performance as the traditional softmax, but with a selective, more compact, attention focus.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 649  (*Influential: 73*)\n\n#### 2. EXACT: Scalable Graph Neural Networks Training via Extreme Activation Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Selective activation neural networks*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Fan Yang, Li Li, Rui Chen, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch, and a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called EXACT, which for the first time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs is a fundamental challenge due to the high memory usage, which is mainly occupied by activations (e.g., node embeddings). Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of nodes retained in memory. In parallel, unlike what has been developed for other types of neural networks, training with compressed activation maps is less explored for GNNs. This extension is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to implement due to the lack of necessary tools in common graph learning packages. To un-leash the potential of this direction, we provide an optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations. Based on the implementation, we propose a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called \u201cEXACT\u201d, which for the \ufb01rst time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations. We systematically analyze the trade-off among the memory saving, time overhead, and accuracy drop. In practice, EXACT can reduce the memory footprint of activations by up to 32 \u00d7 with 0 . 2 - 0 . 5% accuracy drop and 10 - 25% time overhead across different models and datasets. We implement EXACT as an extension for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch. In practice, for Pytorch Geometric, EXACT can trim down the hardware requirement of training a three-layer full-batch GraphSAGE on ogbn-products from a 48GB GPU to a 12GB GPU.

Globally Optimal Training of Neural Networks with Threshold Activation Functions\n\n*From Search Query: Selective activation neural networks*\n\n*Tolga Ergen, Halil Ibrahim Gulluk, Jonathan Lacotte, Mert Pilanci*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n**Abstract:** Threshold activation functions are highly preferable in neural networks due to their efficiency in hardware implementations. Moreover, their mode of operation is more interpretable and resembles that of biological neurons. However, traditional gradient based algorithms such as Gradient Descent cannot be used to train the parameters of neural networks with threshold activations since the activation function has zero gradient except at a single non-differentiable point. To this end, we study weight decay regularized training problems of deep neural networks with threshold activations. We first show that regularized deep threshold network training problems can be equivalently formulated as a standard convex optimization problem, which parallels the LASSO method, provided that the last hidden layer width exceeds a certain threshold. We also derive a simplified convex optimization formulation when the dataset can be shattered at a certain layer of the network. We corroborate our theoretical results with various numerical experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. FragRel: Exploiting Fragment-level Relations in the External Memory of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical memory language models*\n\n*Xihang Yue, Linchao Zhu, Yi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A relation-aware fragment assessment criteria is introduced and the fragment-connected Hierarchical Memory based LLM is presented, which validates the benefits of involving these relations on long story understanding, repository-level code generation, and long-term chatting.\n\n**Abstract:** To process contexts with unlimited length using Large Language Models (LLMs), recent studies explore hierarchically managing the long text. Only several text fragments are taken from the external memory and passed into the temporary working memory, i.e., LLM's context window. However, existing approaches isolatedly handle the text fragments without considering their structural connections, thereby suffering limited capability on texts with intensive inter-relations, e.g., coherent stories and code repositories. This work attempts to resolve this by exploiting the fragment-level relations in external memory. First, we formulate the fragment-level relations and present several instantiations for different text types. Next, we introduce a relation-aware fragment assessment criteria upon previous independent fragment assessment. Finally, we present the fragment-connected Hierarchical Memory based LLM. We validate the benefits of involving these relations on long story understanding, repository-level code generation, and long-term chatting.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Dior-CVAE: Pre-trained Language Models and Diffusion Priors for Variational Dialog Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical memory language models*\n\n*Tianyu Yang, Thy Thy Tran, Iryna Gurevych*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work employs a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM, and proposes memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation.\n\n**Abstract:** Current variational dialog models have employed pre-trained language models (PLMs) to parameterize the likelihood and posterior distributions. However, the Gaussian assumption made on the prior distribution is incompatible with these distributions, thus restricting the diversity of generated responses. These models also suffer from posterior collapse, i.e., the decoder tends to ignore latent variables and directly access information captured in the encoder through the cross-attention mechanism. In this work, we propose Dior-CVAE, a hierarchical conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with diffusion priors to address these challenges. We employ a diffusion model to increase the complexity of the prior distribution and its compatibility with the distributions produced by a PLM. Also, we propose memory dropout to the cross-attention mechanism, which actively encourages the use of latent variables for response generation. Overall, experiments across two commonly used open-domain dialog datasets show that our method can generate more diverse responses without large-scale dialog pre-training.

History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical memory language models*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. Neural Lyapunov Control of Unknown Nonlinear Systems with Stability Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability neural networks*\n\n*Rui Zhou, Thanin Quartz, H. Sterck, Jun Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A learning framework to simultaneously stabilize an unknown nonlinear system with a neural controller and learn a neural Lyapunov function to certify a region of attraction (ROA) for the closed-loop system is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning for control of dynamical systems with formal guarantees remains a challenging task. This paper proposes a learning framework to simultaneously stabilize an unknown nonlinear system with a neural controller and learn a neural Lyapunov function to certify a region of attraction (ROA) for the closed-loop system. The algorithmic structure consists of two neural networks and a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver. The first neural network is responsible for learning the unknown dynamics. The second neural network aims to identify a valid Lyapunov function and a provably stabilizing nonlinear controller. The SMT solver then verifies that the candidate Lyapunov function indeed satisfies the Lyapunov conditions. We provide theoretical guarantees of the proposed learning framework in terms of the closed-loop stability for the unknown nonlinear system. We illustrate the effectiveness of the approach with a set of numerical experiments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Neural Lyapunov Control for Discrete-Time Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability neural networks*\n\n*Junlin Wu, Andrew Clark, Y. Kantaros, Yevgeniy Vorobeychik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in a broad class of discrete-time systems and is the first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.\n\n**Abstract:** While ensuring stability for linear systems is well understood, it remains a major challenge for nonlinear systems. A general approach in such cases is to compute a combination of a Lyapunov function and an associated control policy. However, finding Lyapunov functions for general nonlinear systems is a challenging task. To address this challenge, several methods have been proposed that represent Lyapunov functions using neural networks. However, such approaches either focus on continuous-time systems, or highly restricted classes of nonlinear dynamics. We propose the first approach for learning neural Lyapunov control in a broad class of discrete-time systems. Three key ingredients enable us to effectively learn provably stable control policies. The first is a novel mixed-integer linear programming approach for verifying the discrete-time Lyapunov stability conditions, leveraging the particular structure of these conditions. The second is a novel approach for computing verified sublevel sets. The third is a heuristic gradient-based method for quickly finding counterexamples to significantly speed up Lyapunov function learning. Our experiments on four standard benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. For example, on the path tracking benchmark, we outperform recent neural Lyapunov control baselines by an order of magnitude in both running time and the size of the region of attraction, and on two of the four benchmarks (cartpole and PVTOL), ours is the first automated approach to return a provably stable controller.

Adversarial Robustness in Graph Neural Networks: A Hamiltonian Approach\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability neural networks*\n\n*Kai Zhao, Qiyu Kang, Yang Song, Rui She, Sijie Wang, Wee Peng Tay*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates GNNs derived from diverse neural flows, concentrating on their connection to various stability notions such as BIBO stability, Lyapunov stability, structural stability, and conservative stability, to demonstrate robustness against adversarial perturbations.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations, including those that affect both node features and graph topology. This paper investigates GNNs derived from diverse neural flows, concentrating on their connection to various stability notions such as BIBO stability, Lyapunov stability, structural stability, and conservative stability. We argue that Lyapunov stability, despite its common use, does not necessarily ensure adversarial robustness. Inspired by physics principles, we advocate for the use of conservative Hamiltonian neural flows to construct GNNs that are robust to adversarial attacks. The adversarial robustness of different neural flow GNNs is empirically compared on several benchmark datasets under a variety of adversarial attacks. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that GNNs leveraging conservative Hamiltonian flows with Lyapunov stability substantially improve robustness against adversarial perturbations.

Performance Evaluation of Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control based on Different Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Selective activation neural networks*\n\n*Woon-Seng Gan, Dongyuan Shi, Zhengding Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to its rapid response time and a high degree of robustness, the selective fixed-filter active noise control (SFANC) method appears to be a viable candidate for widespread use in a variety of practical active noise control (ANC) systems. In comparison to conventional fixed-filter ANC methods, SFANC can select the pre-trained control filters for different types of noise. Deep learning technologies, thus, can be used in SFANC methods to enable a more flexible selection of the most appropriate control filters for attenuating various noises. Furthermore, with the assistance of a deep neural network, the selecting strategy can be learned automatically from noise data rather than through trial and error, which significantly simplifies and improves the practicability of ANC design. Therefore, this paper investigates the performance of SFANC based on different one-dimensional and two-dimensional convolutional neural networks. Additionally, we conducted comparative analyses of several network training strategies and discovered that fine-tuning could improve selection performance.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Can Active Memory Replace Attention?\n\n*From Search Query: Selective activation neural networks*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts\nof its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in\nrecent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning,\nspeech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it\nhad probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.\n  Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative\nmechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of\nit in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory,\nimproved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in\ngenerative modelling.\n  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most\nnatural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We\nanalyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active\nmemory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and\ngeneralizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain\nwhy previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when\nactive memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.\n\n**Conference:** can-active-memory-replace-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 3.

MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical memory language models*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Kevin Lin, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Sarah Wooders, Shishir G. Patil, Vivian Fang, Charles Packer*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users. We release MemGPT code and data for our experiments at https://memgpt.ai.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. The Lyapunov Neural Network: Adaptive Stability Certification for Safe Learning of Dynamical Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability neural networks*\n\n*Andreas Krause, Felix Berkenkamp, Spencer M. Richards*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning algorithms have shown considerable prowess in simulation by allowing\nrobots to adapt to uncertain environments and improve their performance.\nHowever, such algorithms are rarely used in practice on safety-critical\nsystems, since the learned policy typically does not yield any safety\nguarantees. That is, the required exploration may cause physical harm to the\nrobot or its environment. In this paper, we present a method to learn accurate\nsafety certificates for nonlinear, closed-loop dynamical systems. Specifically,\nwe construct a neural network Lyapunov function and a training algorithm that\nadapts it to the shape of the largest safe region in the state space. The\nalgorithm relies only on knowledge of inputs and outputs of the dynamics,\nrather than on any specific model structure. We demonstrate our method by\nlearning the safe region of attraction for a simulated inverted pendulum.\nFurthermore, we discuss how our method can be used in safe learning algorithms\ntogether with statistical models of dynamical systems.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-02\n\n\n\n#### 6. Lyapunov-stable neural-network control\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning has had a far reaching impact in robotics. Specifically, deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been highly effective in synthesizing neural-network controllers for a wide range of tasks. However, despite this empirical success, these controllers still lack theoretical guarantees on their performance, such as Lyapunov stability (i.e., all trajectories of the closed-loop system are guaranteed to converge to a goal state under the control policy). This is in stark contrast to traditional model-based controller design, where principled approaches (like LQR) can synthesize stable controllers with provable guarantees. To address this gap, we propose a generic method to synthesize a Lyapunov-stable neural-network controller, together with a neural-network Lyapunov function to simultaneously certify its stability. Our approach formulates the Lyapunov condition verification as a mixed-integer linear program (MIP). Our MIP verifier either certifies the Lyapunov condition, or generates counter examples that can help improve the candidate controller and the Lyapunov function. We also present an optimization program to compute an inner approximation of the region of attraction for the closed-loop system. We apply our approach to robots including an inverted pendulum, a 2D and a 3D quadrotor, and showcase that our neural-network controller outperforms a baseline LQR controller.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/23 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1609.07959, 2016.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/30 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

Deep SSMs demonstrate outstanding performance across a diverse set of domains, at a reduced training and inference cost compared to attention-based transformers. Recent developments show that if the linear recurrence powering SSMs allows for multiplicative interactions between inputs and hidden states (e.g. GateLoop, Mamba, GLA), then the resulting architecture can surpass in both in accuracy and efficiency attention-powered foundation models trained on text, at scales of billion parameters. In this paper, we give theoretical grounding to this recent finding using tools from Rough Path Theory: we show that when random linear recurrences are equipped with simple input-controlled transitions (selectivity mechanism), then the hidden state is provably a low-dimensional projection of a powerful mathematical object called the signature of the input -- capturing non-linear interactions between tokens at distinct timescales. Our theory not only motivates the success of modern selective state-space models such as Mamba but also provides a solid framework to understand the expressive power of future SSM variants.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/45 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nHambly, B. and Lyons, T.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

Improving Stability of Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models via Component-Wise Gradient Norm Clipping\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability language models*\n\n*Chenghao Yang, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components, which achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning over large pretrained language models (PLMs) has established many state-of-the-art results. Despite its superior performance, such fine-tuning can be unstable, resulting in significant variance in performance and potential risks for practical applications. Previous works have attributed such instability to the catastrophic forgetting problem in the top layers of PLMs, which indicates iteratively fine-tuning layers in a top-down manner is a promising solution. In this paper, we first point out that this method does not always work out due to the different convergence speeds of different layers/modules. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.

Large Language Models are Not Yet Human-Level Evaluators for Abstractive Summarization\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability language models*\n\n*Chenhui Shen, Liying Cheng, Yang You, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that while ChatGPT and GPT-4 outperform the commonly used automatic metrics, they are not ready as human replacements due to significant limitations, and LLM evaluators rate each candidate system inconsistently and are dimension-dependent.\n\n**Abstract:** With the recent undeniable advancement in reasoning abilities in large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4, there is a growing trend for using LLMs on various tasks. One area where LLMs can be employed is as an alternative evaluation metric for complex generative tasks, which generally demands expensive human judges to complement the traditional automatic metrics for various evaluation dimensions such as fluency and consistency. In this work, we conduct extensive analysis to investigate the stability and reliability of LLMs as automatic evaluators for abstractive summarization. We found that while ChatGPT and GPT-4 outperform the commonly used automatic metrics, they are not ready as human replacements due to significant limitations. That is, LLM evaluators rate each candidate system inconsistently and are dimension-dependent. They also struggle to compare candidates with close performance and become more unreliable with higher-quality summaries by obtaining a lower correlation with humans. In other words, with better abstractive summarization systems being introduced at a fast pace, LLMs may result in misleading and unreliable evaluations.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Stable and low-precision training for large-scale vision-language models\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability language models*\n\n*Mitchell Wortsman, Tim Dettmers, Luke Zettlemoyer, Ari S. Morcos, Ali Farhadi, Ludwig Schmidt*\n\n**TL;DR:** SwitchBack is introduced, a linear layer for int8 quantized training which provides a speed-up of 13-25% while matching the performance of bfloat16 training within 0.1 percentage points for the 1B parameter CLIP ViT-Huge -- the largest int8 training to date.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce new methods for 1) accelerating and 2) stabilizing training for large language-vision models. 1) For acceleration, we introduce SwitchBack, a linear layer for int8 quantized training which provides a speed-up of 13-25% while matching the performance of bfloat16 training within 0.1 percentage points for the 1B parameter CLIP ViT-Huge -- the largest int8 training to date. Our main focus is int8 as GPU support for float8 is rare, though we also analyze float8 training through simulation. While SwitchBack proves effective for float8, we show that standard techniques are also successful if the network is trained and initialized so that large feature magnitudes are discouraged, which we accomplish via layer-scale initialized with zeros. 2) For stability, we analyze loss spikes and find they consistently occur 1-8 iterations after the squared gradients become under-estimated by their AdamW second moment estimator. As a result, we recommend an AdamW-Adafactor hybrid which avoids loss spikes when training a CLIP ViT-Huge model and outperforms gradient clipping at the scales we test.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Universal approximation power of deep residual neural networks via nonlinear control theory\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory neural networks NLP*\n\n*P. Tabuada, B. Gharesifard*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides a general sufficient condition for a residual network to have the power of universal approximation by asking the activation function, or one of its derivatives, to satisfy a quadratic differential equation.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explain the universal approximation capabilities of deep residual neural networks through geometric nonlinear control. Inspired by recent work establishing links between residual networks and control systems, we provide a general sufficient condition for a residual network to have the power of universal approximation by asking the activation function, or one of its derivatives, to satisfy a quadratic differential equation. Many activation functions used in practice satisfy this assumption, exactly or approximately, and we show this property to be sufficient for an adequately deep neural network with $n+1$ neurons per layer to approximate arbitrarily well, on a compact set and with respect to the supremum norm, any continuous function from $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to $\\mathbb{R}^n$. We further show this result to hold for very simple architectures for which the weights only need to assume two values. The first key technical contribution consists of relating the universal approximation problem to controllability of an ensemble of control systems corresponding to a residual network and to leverage classical Lie algebraic techniques to characterize controllability. The second technical contribution is to identify monotonicity as the bridge between controllability of finite ensembles and uniform approximability on compact sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Are aligned neural networks adversarially aligned?\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory neural networks NLP*\n\n*Nicholas Carlini, Milad Nasr, Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, Matthew Jagielski, Irena Gao, Anas Awadalla, Pang Wei Koh, Daphne Ippolito, Katherine Lee, Florian Tram\u00e8r, Ludwig Schmidt*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, the authors can find adversarial inputs with brute force.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models are now tuned to align with the goals of their creators, namely to be\"helpful and harmless.\"These models should respond helpfully to user questions, but refuse to answer requests that could cause harm. However, adversarial users can construct inputs which circumvent attempts at alignment. In this work, we study adversarial alignment, and ask to what extent these models remain aligned when interacting with an adversarial user who constructs worst-case inputs (adversarial examples). These inputs are designed to cause the model to emit harmful content that would otherwise be prohibited. We show that existing NLP-based optimization attacks are insufficiently powerful to reliably attack aligned text models: even when current NLP-based attacks fail, we can find adversarial inputs with brute force. As a result, the failure of current attacks should not be seen as proof that aligned text models remain aligned under adversarial inputs. However the recent trend in large-scale ML models is multimodal models that allow users to provide images that influence the text that is generated. We show these models can be easily attacked, i.e., induced to perform arbitrary un-aligned behavior through adversarial perturbation of the input image. We conjecture that improved NLP attacks may demonstrate this same level of adversarial control over text-only models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 163  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 6. Learning Disentangled Semantic Spaces of Explanations via Invertible Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory neural networks NLP*\n\n*Yingji Zhang, Danilo S. Carvalho, Ian Pratt-Hartmann, Andr\u00e9 Freitas*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work contributes to a novel notion of sentence semantic disentanglement and introduces a flow-based invertible neural network (INN) mechanism integrated with a transformer-based language Autoencoder (AE) in order to deliver latent spaces with better separability properties.\n\n**Abstract:** Disentangled latent spaces usually have better semantic separability and geometrical properties, which leads to better interpretability and more controllable data generation. While this has been well investigated in Computer Vision, in tasks such as image disentanglement, in the NLP domain sentence disentanglement is still comparatively under-investigated. Most previous work have concentrated on disentangling task-specific generative factors, such as sentiment, within the context of style transfer. In this work, we focus on a more general form of sentence disentanglement, targeting the localised modification and control of more general sentence semantic features. To achieve this, we contribute to a novel notion of sentence semantic disentanglement and introduce a flow-based invertible neural network (INN) mechanism integrated with a transformer-based language Autoencoder (AE) in order to deliver latent spaces with better separability properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the model can conform the distributed latent space into a better semantically disentangled sentence space, leading to improved language interpretability and controlled generation when compared to the recent state-of-the-art language VAE models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. State and parameter learning with PARIS particle Gibbs\n\n*From Search Query: Stability guarantees in sequence modeling*\n\n*Gabriel Victorino Cardoso, Yazid Janati, S. Corff, \u00c9. Moulines, J. Olsson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel additive smoothing algorithm is designed, the Parisian particle Gibbs PPG sampler, which can be viewed as a PaRIS algorithm driven by conditional SMC moves, resulting in bias-reduced estimates of the targeted quantities, which are the first non-asymptotic results of this kind in this setting.\n\n**Abstract:** Non-linear state-space models, also known as general hidden Markov models, are ubiquitous in statistical machine learning, being the most classical generative models for serial data and sequences in general. The particle-based, rapid incremental smoother PaRIS is a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) technique allowing for efficient online approximation of expectations of additive functionals under the smoothing distribution in these models. Such expectations appear naturally in several learning contexts, such as likelihood estimation (MLE) and Markov score climbing (MSC). PARIS has linear computational complexity, limited memory requirements and comes with non-asymptotic bounds, convergence results and stability guarantees. Still, being based on self-normalised importance sampling, the PaRIS estimator is biased. Our first contribution is to design a novel additive smoothing algorithm, the Parisian particle Gibbs PPG sampler, which can be viewed as a PaRIS algorithm driven by conditional SMC moves, resulting in bias-reduced estimates of the targeted quantities. We substantiate the PPG algorithm with theoretical results, including new bounds on bias and variance as well as deviation inequalities. Our second contribution is to apply PPG in a learning framework, covering MLE and MSC as special examples. In this context, we establish, under standard assumptions, non-asymptotic bounds highlighting the value of bias reduction and the implicit Rao--Blackwellization of PPG. These are the first non-asymptotic results of this kind in this setting. We illustrate our theoretical results with numerical experiments supporting our claims.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Arabisc: Context-Sensitive Neural Spelling Checker\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory neural networks NLP*\n\n*Andy Way, Rejwanul Haque, Yasmin Moslem*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional statistical approaches to spelling correction usually consist of two consecutive processes \u2014 error detection and correction \u2014 and they are generally computationally intensive. Current state-of-the-art neural spelling correction models usually attempt to correct spelling errors directly over an entire sentence, which, as a consequence, lacks control of the process, e.g. they are prone to overcorrection. In recent years, recurrent neural networks (RNNs), in particular long short-term memory (LSTM) hidden units, have proven increasingly popular and powerful models for many natural language processing (NLP) problems. Accordingly, we made use of a bidirectional LSTM language model (LM) for our context-sensitive spelling detection and correction model which is shown to have much control over the correction process. While the use of LMs for spelling checking and correction is not new to this line of NLP research, our proposed approach makes better use of the rich neighbouring context, not only from before the word to be corrected, but also after it, via a dual-input deep LSTM network. Although in theory our proposed approach can be applied to any language, we carried out our experiments on Arabic, which we believe adds additional value given the fact that there are limited linguistic resources readily available in Arabic in comparison to many languages. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed methods are effective in both improving the quality of correction suggestions and minimising overcorrection.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Predicting trends in the quality of state-of-the-art neural networks without access to training or testing data\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory neural networks NLP*\n\n*Michael W. Mahoney, Peng, Tongsu, Charles H. Martin*\n\n**Abstract:** In many applications, one works with neural network models trained by someone else. For such pretrained models, one may not have access to training data or test data. Moreover, one may not know details about the model, e.g., the specifics of the training data, the loss function, the hyperparameter values, etc. Given one or many pretrained models, it is a challenge to say anything about the expected performance or quality of the models. Here, we address this challenge by providing a detailed meta-analysis of hundreds of publicly-available pretrained models. We examine norm based capacity control metrics as well as power law based metrics from the recently-developed Theory of Heavy-Tailed Self Regularization. We find that norm based metrics correlate well with reported test accuracies for well-trained models, but that they often cannot distinguish well-trained versus poorly-trained models. We also find that power law based metrics can do much better -- quantitatively better at discriminating among series of well-trained models with a given architecture; and qualitatively better at discriminating well-trained versus poorly-trained models. These methods can be used to identify when a pretrained neural network has problems that cannot be detected simply by examining training/test accuracies.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. CoT: Cooperative Training for Generative Modeling of Discrete Data\n\n*From Search Query: Stability guarantees in sequence modeling*\n\n*Wei-Nan Zhang, Lantao Yu, Yong Yu, Siyuan Feng, Sidi Lu, Yaoming Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the generative models of sequential discrete data. To tackle the exposure bias problem inherent in maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), generative adversarial networks (GANs) are introduced to penalize the unrealistic generated samples. To exploit the supervision signal from the discriminator, most previous models leverage REINFORCE to address the non-differentiable problem of sequential discrete data. However, because of the unstable property of the training signal during the dynamic process of adversarial training, the effectiveness of REINFORCE, in this case, is hardly guaranteed. To deal with such a problem, we propose a novel approach called Cooperative Training (CoT) to improve the training of sequence generative models. CoT transforms the min-max game of GANs into a joint maximization framework and manages to explicitly estimate and optimize Jensen-Shannon divergence. Moreover, CoT works without the necessity of pre-training via MLE, which is crucial to the success of previous methods. In the experiments, compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, CoT shows superior or at least competitive performance on sample quality, diversity, as well as training stability.\n\n**Conference:** cot-cooperative-training-for-generative-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Stable Conformal Prediction Sets\n\n*From Search Query: Stability guarantees in sequence modeling*\n\n*Eugene Ndiaye*\n\n**Abstract:** When one observes a sequence of variables $(x_1, y_1), \\ldots, (x_n, y_n)$, Conformal Prediction (CP) is a methodology that allows to estimate a confidence set for $y_{n+1}$ given $x_{n+1}$ by merely assuming that the distribution of the data is exchangeable. CP sets have guaranteed coverage for any finite population size $n$. While appealing, the computation of such a set turns out to be infeasible in general, e.g. when the unknown variable $y_{n+1}$ is continuous. The bottleneck is that it is based on a procedure that readjusts a prediction model on data where we replace the unknown target by all its possible values in order to select the most probable one. This requires computing an infinite number of models, which often makes it intractable. In this paper, we combine CP techniques with classical algorithmic stability bounds to derive a prediction set computable with a single model fit. We demonstrate that our proposed confidence set does not lose any coverage guarantees while avoiding the need for data splitting as currently done in the literature. We provide some numerical experiments to illustrate the tightness of our estimation when the sample size is sufficiently large, on both synthetic and real datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the **SelectiveStateRetNet**, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Novelty Assessment and Integration\n\n#### Similar Mechanisms in Existing Models\n- **Adaptive Computation Time (ACT)** and **Skip RNN** already introduce dynamic computation based on input complexity.

These models have become recently popular in the machine learning community since, owing to their parallelizability, they can be efficiently and scalably trained to tackle extremely-long sequence classification and regression problems. Interestingly, SSMs appear as an effective way to learn deep Wiener models, which allows to reframe SSMs as an extension of a model class commonly used in system identification. In order to stimulate a fruitful exchange of ideas between the machine learning and system identification communities, we deem it useful to summarize the recent contributions on the topic in a structured and accessible form.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

Score: 0.95)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Lyapunov Density Models: Constraining Distribution Shift in Learning-Based Control\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability autoregressive models*\n\n*Katie Kang, Paula Gradu, Jason J. Choi, Michael Janner, C. Tomlin, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a generalization of control Lyapunov functions and density models that provides guarantees on an agent's ability to stay in-distribution over its entire trajectory, by combining concepts from LyAPunov stability and density estimation.\n\n**Abstract:** Learned models and policies can generalize effectively when evaluated within the distribution of the training data, but can produce unpredictable and erroneous outputs on out-of-distribution inputs. In order to avoid distribution shift when deploying learning-based control algorithms, we seek a mechanism to constrain the agent to states and actions that resemble those that it was trained on. In control theory, Lyapunov stability and control-invariant sets allow us to make guarantees about controllers that stabilize the system around specific states, while in machine learning, density models allow us to estimate the training data distribution. Can we combine these two concepts, producing learning-based control algorithms that constrain the system to in-distribution states using only in-distribution actions? In this work, we propose to do this by combining concepts from Lyapunov stability and density estimation, introducing Lyapunov density models: a generalization of control Lyapunov functions and density models that provides guarantees on an agent's ability to stay in-distribution over its entire trajectory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. The Stability-Efficiency Dilemma: Investigating Sequence Length Warmup for Training GPT Models\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability autoregressive models*\n\n*Conglong Li, Minjia Zhang, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** An in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model finds that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works have demonstrated great success in pre-training large-scale autoregressive language models on massive GPUs. To reduce the wall-clock training time, a common practice is to increase the batch size and learning rate. However, such practice is often brittle and leads to a so-called stability-efficiency dilemma: increasing the batch sizes and learning rates leads to better training efficiency but can also result in training instability, leading to poor generalization accuracy or failed runs. To better understand this phenomenon, we conduct an in-depth analysis on large-scale pre-training experiments replicating the GPT-2 model. We find that there is a strong correlation between training instability and extreme values of gradient variance, and that samples with long sequence lengths contribute to these extreme gradient variance values, especially at the beginning of the training, indicating that long sequence length can be a main source of training instability. Based on the analysis, we present a Sequence Length Warmup method that aims to solve the training stability-efficiency dilemma. Experiments replicating GPT-2 models show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training instability. To achieve the same or better zero-shot evaluation results, our method reduces the required number of training tokens and wall clock time by up to 2.2x and 3.7x, respectively. Experiments replicating GPT-3 model (125M) show that our approach enables stable training with 8x larger batch size and 40x larger learning rate, and retains 99% of the zero-shot accuracy on 11 tasks using 10x less data and 17x less time compared to the original GPT-3 training recipe, while the baseline diverges under the same settings and only retain 95% of accuracy under lower learning rate.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Variance-reduced Zeroth-Order Methods for Fine-Tuning Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Lyapunov stability autoregressive models*\n\n*Tanmay Gautam, Youngsuk Park, Hao Zhou, Parameswaran Raman, Wooseok Ha*\n\n**TL;DR:** Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) is introduced and its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks is demonstrated, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning language models (LMs) has demonstrated success in a wide array of downstream tasks. However, as LMs are scaled up, the memory requirements for backpropagation become prohibitively high. Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization methods can leverage memory-efficient forward passes to estimate gradients. More recently, MeZO, an adaptation of ZO-SGD, has been shown to consistently outperform zero-shot and in-context learning when combined with suitable task prompts. In this work, we couple ZO methods with variance reduction techniques to enhance stability and convergence for inference-based LM fine-tuning. We introduce Memory-Efficient Zeroth-Order Stochastic Variance-Reduced Gradient (MeZO-SVRG) and demonstrate its efficacy across multiple LM fine-tuning tasks, eliminating the reliance on task-specific prompts. Evaluated across a range of both masked and autoregressive LMs on benchmark GLUE tasks, MeZO-SVRG outperforms MeZO with up to 20% increase in test accuracies in both full- and partial-parameter fine-tuning settings. MeZO-SVRG benefits from reduced computation time as it often surpasses MeZO's peak test accuracy with a $2\\times$ reduction in GPU-hours. MeZO-SVRG significantly reduces the required memory footprint compared to first-order SGD, i.e. by $2\\times$ for autoregressive models. Our experiments highlight that MeZO-SVRG's memory savings progressively improve compared to SGD with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. PIDformer: Transformer Meets Control Theory\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory in transformer architectures*\n\n*Tam Nguyen, C'esar A. Uribe, Tan M. Nguyen, R. Baraniuk*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel class of transformers is derived, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we address two main shortcomings of transformer architectures: input corruption and rank collapse in their output representation. We unveil self-attention as an autonomous state-space model that inherently promotes smoothness in its solutions, leading to lower-rank outputs and diminished representation capacity. Moreover, the steady-state solution of the model is sensitive to input perturbations. We incorporate a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) closed-loop feedback control system with a reference point into the model to improve robustness and representation capacity. This integration aims to preserve high-frequency details while bolstering model stability, rendering it more noise-resilient. The resulting controlled state-space model is theoretically proven robust and adept at addressing the rank collapse. Motivated by this control framework, we derive a novel class of transformers, PID-controlled Transformer (PIDformer), aimed at improving robustness and mitigating the rank-collapse issue inherent in softmax transformers. We empirically evaluate the model for advantages and robustness against baseline transformers across various practical tasks, including object classification, image segmentation, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Hofmann, Chris J. Maddison, Daniel M. Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width, and shows that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation indexed by the depth-to-width ratio.\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning theory, the covariance matrix of the representations serves as a proxy to examine the network's trainability. Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Deep Transformers without Shortcuts: Modifying Self-attention for Faithful Signal Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory in transformer architectures*\n\n*Bobby He, James Martens, Guodong Zhang, Aleksandar Botev, Andy Brock, Samuel L. Smith, Y. Teh*\n\n**TL;DR:** Several approaches are designed that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking.\n\n**Abstract:** Skip connections and normalisation layers form two standard architectural components that are ubiquitous for the training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), but whose precise roles are poorly understood. Recent approaches such as Deep Kernel Shaping have made progress towards reducing our reliance on them, using insights from wide NN kernel theory to improve signal propagation in vanilla DNNs (which we define as networks without skips or normalisation). However, these approaches are incompatible with the self-attention layers present in transformers, whose kernels are intrinsically more complicated to analyse and control. And so the question remains: is it possible to train deep vanilla transformers? We answer this question in the affirmative by designing several approaches that use combinations of parameter initialisations, bias matrices and location-dependent rescaling to achieve faithful signal propagation in vanilla transformers. Our methods address various intricacies specific to signal propagation in transformers, including the interaction with positional encoding and causal masking. In experiments on WikiText-103 and C4, our approaches enable deep transformers without normalisation to train at speeds matching their standard counterparts, and deep vanilla transformers to reach the same performance as standard ones after about 5 times more iterations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Are Neural Topic Models Broken?\n\n*From Search Query: Stability analysis neural language models*\n\n*Alexander Miserlis Hoyle, Pranav Goel, Rupak Sarkar, P. Resnik*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work analyzes two related aspects of topic models that affect their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practice: the stability of their estimates and the extent to which the model's discovered categories align with human-determined categories in the data.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, the relationship between automated and human evaluation of topic models has been called into question. Method developers have staked the efficacy of new topic model variants on automated measures, and their failure to approximate human preferences places these models on uncertain ground. Moreover, existing evaluation paradigms are often divorced from real-world use. Motivated by content analysis as a dominant real-world use case for topic modeling, we analyze two related aspects of topic models that affect their effectiveness and trustworthiness in practice for that purpose: the stability of their estimates and the extent to which the model's discovered categories align with human-determined categories in the data. We find that neural topic models fare worse in both respects compared to an established classical method. We take a step toward addressing both issues in tandem by demonstrating that a straightforward ensembling method can reliably outperform the members of the ensemble.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

To elucidate the mechanisms by which the models accomplish this behavior, this study applies causal mediation analysis to pre-trained neural language models. We investigate the magnitude of models\u2019 preferences for grammatical inflections, as well as whether neurons process subject-verb agreement similarly across sentences with different syntactic structures. We uncover similarities and differences across architectures and model sizes\u2014notably, that larger models do not necessarily learn stronger preferences.

Data-driven discovery of Koopman eigenfunctions for control\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory in transformer architectures*\n\n*J. Nathan Kutz, Steven L. Brunton, Eurika Kaiser*\n\n**Abstract:** Data-driven transformations that reformulate nonlinear systems in a linear\nframework have the potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control\nof strongly nonlinear dynamics using linear systems theory. The Koopman\noperator has emerged as a principled linear embedding of nonlinear dynamics,\nand its eigenfunctions establish intrinsic coordinates along which the dynamics\nbehave linearly. In this work, we demonstrate a data-driven control\narchitecture, termed Koopman Reduced Order Nonlinear Identification and Control\n(KRONIC), that utilizes Koopman eigenfunctions to manipulate nonlinear systems\nusing linear systems theory. We approximate these eigenfunctions with\ndata-driven regression and power series expansions, based on the partial\ndifferential equation governing the infinitesimal generator of the Koopman\noperator. Although previous regression-based methods may identify spurious\ndynamics, we show that lightly damped eigenfunctions may be faithfully\nextracted using sparse regression. These lightly damped eigenfunctions are\nparticularly relevant for control, as they correspond to nearly conserved\nquantities that are associated with persistent dynamics, such as the\nHamiltonian. We derive the form of control in these intrinsic eigenfunction\ncoordinates and design nonlinear controllers using standard linear control\ntheory. KRONIC is then demonstrated on a number of relevant examples, including\n1) a nonlinear system with a known linear embedding, 2) a variety of\nHamiltonian systems, and 3) a high-dimensional double-gyre model for ocean\nmixing.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Vision Mamba: A Comprehensive Survey and Taxonomy\n\n*From Search Query: Control theory in transformer architectures*\n\n*Lei Zhang, Chenxu Zhang, Xiao Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** State Space Model (SSM) is a mathematical model used to describe and analyze the behavior of dynamic systems. This model has witnessed numerous applications in several fields, including control theory, signal processing, economics and machine learning. In the field of deep learning, state space models are used to process sequence data, such as time series analysis, natural language processing (NLP) and video understanding. By mapping sequence data to state space, long-term dependencies in the data can be better captured. In particular, modern SSMs have shown strong representational capabilities in NLP, especially in long sequence modeling, while maintaining linear time complexity. Notably, based on the latest state-space models, Mamba merges time-varying parameters into SSMs and formulates a hardware-aware algorithm for efficient training and inference. Given its impressive efficiency and strong long-range dependency modeling capability, Mamba is expected to become a new AI architecture that may outperform Transformer. Recently, a number of works have attempted to study the potential of Mamba in various fields, such as general vision, multi-modal, medical image analysis and remote sensing image analysis, by extending Mamba from natural language domain to visual domain. To fully understand Mamba in the visual domain, we conduct a comprehensive survey and present a taxonomy study. This survey focuses on Mamba's application to a variety of visual tasks and data types, and discusses its predecessors, recent advances and far-reaching impact on a wide range of domains. Since Mamba is now on an upward trend, please actively notice us if you have new findings, and new progress on Mamba will be included in this survey in a timely manner and updated on the Mamba project at https://github.com/lx6c78/Vision-Mamba-A-Comprehensive-Survey-and-Taxonomy.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. Blackbox Meets Blackbox: Representational Similarity \\& Stability Analysis of Neural Language Models and Brains\n\n*From Search Query: Stability analysis neural language models*\n\n*Samira Abnar, Rochelle Choenni, Lisa Beinborn, Willem Zuidema*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we define and apply representational stability analysis (ReStA), an intuitive way of analyzing neural language models. ReStA is a variant of the popular representational similarity analysis (RSA) in cognitive neuroscience. While RSA can be used to compare representations in models, model components, and human brains, ReStA compares instances of the same model, while systematically varying single model parameter. Using ReStA, we study four recent and successful neural language models, and evaluate how sensitive their internal representations are to the amount of prior context. Using RSA, we perform a systematic study of how similar the representational spaces in the first and second (or higher) layers of these models are to each other and to patterns of activation in the human brain. Our results reveal surprisingly strong differences between language models, and give insights into where the deep linguistic processing, that integrates information over multiple sentences, is happening in these models. The combination of ReStA and RSA on models and brains allows us to start addressing the important question of what kind of linguistic processes we can hope to observe in fMRI brain imaging data. In particular, our results suggest that the data on story reading from Wehbe et al./ (2014) contains a signal of shallow linguistic processing, but show no evidence on the more interesting deep linguistic processing.\n\n**Proceeding:** ws-2019-8\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-01\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Plan of Next Steps**\n\n1. **Conduct Additional Searches:**\n\n   - Utilize the formulated keywords and descriptions to gather more information on the application of control theory and Lyapunov stability in language models.\n   - Focus on recent publications (2020 onwards) to capture the latest developments.\n\n2. **Assess Empirical Results:**\n\n   - Look for experimental studies demonstrating practical implementations of control theory-based stability in neural networks, particularly in language models.\n   - Evaluate whether these methods have led to improvements in performance metrics.\n\n3. **Evaluate Novelty and Impact:**\n\n   - After gathering sufficient information, synthesize the findings to assess the proposal's novelty, feasibility, and potential impact compared to existing models and prior proposals.\n   - Determine if the integration of control theory-based stability provides significant advantages.\n\n4. **Identify Potential Challenges and Mitigation Strategies:**\n\n   - Analyze potential obstacles in implementing the proposed design, such as computational overhead and training complexities.\n   - Explore techniques to address these challenges, ensuring the practical viability of the proposal.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe additional search results provide valuable insights into the application of control theory and Lyapunov stability in neural networks. While there is existing research applying these concepts to analyze and ensure stability in neural networks, their application within language models, and specifically within the RetNetMLP architecture, appears to be less explored.\n\nThe proposal's main novelty may lie in the integration of selective state activation, hierarchical memory management, and control theory-based stability guarantees within RetNetMLP. However, significant overlap with prior proposals necessitates a thorough assessment of whether the proposed approach offers meaningful advantages over existing designs.\n\nFurther investigation is required to:\n\n- Confirm the novelty of applying control theory-based stability in language models.\n- Evaluate the practical implementation and potential benefits.\n- Determine if the integration leads to improvements in accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n---\n\n**Search Queries**\n\n```keywords\nLyapunov stability autoregressive models\nControl theory in transformer architectures\nStability analysis neural language models\n```\n\n```description\nLocate research papers and technical reports that apply control theory or Lyapunov stability analysis to autoregressive language models, including transformers and state-space models.

Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nThe core innovation combines three key components:\n1. Selective state activation based on input relevance\n2. Hierarchical memory management with structured sparsity\n3. Control theory-based stability guarantees\n\n## 4. Design Plan\n\n### 4.1 Selective State Activation\n\n```python\nclass SelectiveStateUnit(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, num_heads):\n        self.hidden_size = hidden_size\n        self.num_heads = num_heads\n        self.state_scorer = StateScorer(hidden_size)\n        self.state_gate = nn.Linear(hidden_size, num_heads)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, state):\n        # Compute state relevance scores\n        scores = self.state_scorer(x)\n        gates = torch.sigmoid(self.state_gate(x))\n        \n        # Selective state update\n        mask = (scores > self.compute_threshold(x))\n        new_state = torch.where(mask, \n                              self.update_state(x, state, gates),\n                              state)\n        return new_state\n        \n    def compute_threshold(self, x):\n        # Adaptive threshold based on input statistics\n        return self.state_scorer.get_adaptive_threshold(x)\n```\n\n### 4.2 Hierarchical Memory Management\n\n```python\nclass HierarchicalMemory(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, levels, dim_per_level):\n        self.levels = levels\n        self.dim_per_level = dim_per_level\n        self.memory_layers = nn.ModuleList([\n            MemoryLevel(dim_per_level[i]) \n            for i in range(levels)\n        ])\n        \n    def forward(self, x, states):\n        outputs = []\n        for level, memory in enumerate(self.memory_layers):\n            # Process at each memory level\n            state = states[level]\n            out, new_state = memory(x, state)\n            outputs.append(out)\n            states[level] = new_state\n            \n        # Combine outputs with learned weights\n        return self.combine_outputs(outputs), states\n```\n\n### 4.3 Stability Control\n\n```python\nclass StabilityController(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size):\n        self.controller = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.lyapunov_fn = LyapunovFunction(hidden_size)\n        \n    def forward(self, state, input_state):\n        # Compute stability metric\n        stability = self.lyapunov_fn(state)\n        \n        # Apply control input\n        control = self.controller(input_state)\n        stable_state = state + control * (1 - stability)\n        \n        return stable_state\n```\n\n### 4.4 Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe selective state activation follows:\n\ns_t = g_t \u2299 \u03d5(W_s x_t + U_s s_{t-1})\n\nwhere g_t is the gating function and \u03d5 is a nonlinearity.\n\nThe stability guarantee is based on the Lyapunov function:\n\nV(s_t) = s_t^T P s_t\n\nwhere P is positive definite and V(s_t) decreases monotonically.\n\n## 5.

Memory level management:\n```python\ndef manage_memory_levels(x, states):\n    # Distribute information across levels\n    scores = [compute_relevance_score(x, s) for s in states]\n    return distribute_by_relevance(x, scores, states)\n```\n\n### 5.2 Hardware Optimization\n\n1. Structured sparsity patterns:\n```python\ndef apply_structured_sparsity(x, block_size=32):\n    # Apply hardware-friendly sparsity\n    blocks = x.view(-1, block_size, x.size(-1))\n    mask = generate_structured_mask(blocks)\n    return (blocks * mask).view(x.shape)\n```\n\n2. Memory access optimization:\n```python\ndef optimize_memory_access(states, batch_size):\n    # Optimize state storage layout\n    return reorder_states_for_locality(states, batch_size)\n```\n\n## 6.
