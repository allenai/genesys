Training large Transformers requires extensive computational and memory resources, especially when modeling long sequences, mainly due to the quadratic complexity (w.r.t. sequence length) in attention layers. Recent advances in efficient transformers [17, 22, 35, 36, 65] leverage attention approximation to overcome the bottleneck by approximating the attention matrices. However, it is challenging to find a robust approximation method that balances the efficiency-accuracy trade-off on a wide variety of tasks [57, 58]. We categorize most of the existing approaches for efficient attention matrix computation into two major groups: exploiting either the sparsity, e.g., Reformer 36], SMYRF [22], or low-rank properties of the attention matrices, e.g., Linformer 65], Linear Transformer 35], and Performer 17]. However, these techniques usually have different strengths and focus on the performance of specific tasks, so their approximations still cause accuracy degradation on many other tasks. For instance, according to a recent benchmark paper 57 and our experiments, low-rank-based attention might be less effective on hierarchically structured data or language modeling tasks, while sparse-based variants do not perform well on classification tasks.

Right: Scatterbrain Workflow. For the attention layer in Transformers, after computing Query $Q$, Key $K$, and Value $V$ matrices, we approximate $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) V$ with two components: (i) sparse $S V$ (ii) low-rank $\\phi(Q)\\left(\\phi(K)^{\\top} V\\right)$. We observe that sparse and low-rank approximations are complementary for many attention matrices in practice, and sparse + low-rank could outperform each individually (Figure 1 left). We empirically categorize the regimes in which sparse or low-rank approximation achieves better error based on the softmax temperature of attention (of which the entropy of softmax distribution can be used as a proxy). We expect that sparse methods perform well if the attention depends on a few entries (low entropy softmax). In contrast, low-rank methods do better if the attention depends on a mixture of many components (high entropy softmax). This explains the phenomenon that current sparse and low-rank-based approaches excel on different kinds of tasks. A natural question is whether one could understand and unify the strength of both approaches. While it is NP-hard to find the optimal combination of sparse and low-rank approximations, Robust PCA [9] is a polynomial-time solution with tight approximation error. We observe that Robust PCA achieves lower approximation error than sparse or low-rank alone on attention matrices. The difference is most pronounced for \"mid-range\" entropy, where we observe that up to $95 \\%$ error reduction is possible. The connection between Robust PCA and attention matrix estimation provides an opportunity to realize a more robust approximation. Specifically, given an attention matrix, one could adaptively perform sparse + lowrank approximation to obtain a low error. However, it comes with three challenges: (i) How to decompose the attention matrices into sparse and low-rank components and estimate them efficiently and accurately; Robust PCA is accurate but slow and requires materializing the full attention, while straightforward addition of sparse and low-rank attention will be inaccurate due to double counting. (ii) It is not clear if there is a theoretical guarantee that sparse + low-rank approximation is strictly better than sparse or low-rank in some regimes, though we observe the separation empirically. (iii) How does the lower approximation error transfer to end-to-end performance in real tasks. In this paper, we propose Scatterbrain, an accurate and efficient robust estimation of attention matrices with theoretical guarantees to address the above challenges. Specifically:\n\n- In Section 3, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximation are complementary and demonstrate that sparse + low-rank structure arises naturally when elements in the input sequence form clusters. We theoretically characterize and analyze the regimes where sparse, low-rank, and sparse + low-rank excel, dictated by the softmax temperature of attention. - In Section 4, inspired by the classical Robust PCA algorithm, we propose Scatterbrain, which efficiently combines sparse and low-rank matrices to approximate attention. In particular, we use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries of the attention matrix (after softmax) without materializing the full matrix and then leverage kernel approximation to parameterize the low-rank part. We prove that our method has a strictly lower approximation error than the low-rank baseline. - In Section 5, we empirically validate our theory and the proposed method, showing that Scatterbrain accurately approximates the attention matrix, is memory efficient for long sequences, and works well across different tasks. First, we show that its approximation accuracy is close to our oracle Robust PCA and\nachieves $2.1 \\times$ lower error compared to other efficient baselines on real benchmarks. This leads to a direct application of Scatterbrain as a drop-in replacement to pre-trained full attention, thus reducing up to $98 \\%$ of the memory required for attention computations in pre-trained T2T-ViT and BigGAN while maintaining similar quality. Last we show that its superior accuracy and efficiency can improve the efficiency-accuracy trade-offs of Transformer end-to-end training. On the WikiText-103 language modeling task, Scatterbrain achieves up to 1 point better perplexity compared to Reformer and Performer. On 5 benchmark long-range tasks, Scatterbrain improves the average accuracy by up to 5 points ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n## 2 Problem Setting and Related Work\n\nWe first define the approximation problem we aim to solve in this paper. Then we discuss the applications of sparse and low-rank techniques in efficient Transformers and introduce robust PCA algorithm. Problem Formulation: In the attention matrix approximation problem, we are given three matrices, query, key, and value, $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ to compute $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) V$. We seek to reduce the quadratic complexity of $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)$ (applied row-wise) with low approximation error. More precisely, for an approximation procedure $f$, we minimize two objectives, the approximation error $\\mathbf{E}\\left[\\left\\|f(Q, K)-\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right)\\right\\|_{F}^{2}\\right]$, and the computation/memory cost $\\mathcal{C}(f(\\cdot))$. Sparse, Low-rank Approximation for Attention Matrices: Recent work exploits the sparsity patterns or finds a low-rank mapping of the original attention matrices to overcome the computational and memory bottlenecks in Transformers [17, 22, 35, 36, 53, 65. Generally, we can divide most of the techniques into two categories - sparse and low-rank approximations. Reformer 36] is a representative sparse variant that uses LSH [3] to retrieve or detect the locations of the attention matrices with large values and reduce the computation from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n \\log n)$. Performer [17] is an example of the low-rank variant, which uses kernelization to avoid explicit $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ computation. One problem of either the sparse or low-rank approximation is that the structure of the attention matrices varies in practice, and it is challenging to perform robust approximation on a wide range of attention matrices. For example, Wang et al. 65] observes that attentions tend to have more low-rank structures in lower layers and Ramsauer et al. [51] shows that they are sparser in the later stage of the training. Ideally, we want to unify the strength of both techniques, but it is NP-hard to find the best combination of sparse and low-rank approximation. Sparse + Low-rank and Robust PCA: Fortunately, classical Robust PCA 97 presents a polynomial algorithm to find the approximately optimal or good combinations of sparse and low-rank approximation of the matrices. The sparse + low-rank matrix structure has been well studied in statistics and signal processing since the late 2000s 9]. This structure naturally generalizes low-rank [33, 62, and sparse 60] matrices. Scatterbrain is built on a line of work, e.g., Bigbird [70, Longformer [5] with the theme of combining multiple types of attention. However, despite the multitude of papers, this sparse + low-rank matrix approximation has not been rigorously studied in the context of attention matrices. We undertake this study and show how we can relax the sparse + low-rank approximation from robust PCA, making it efficient while still retaining PCA's accuracy. In fact, our results shed further light on why Bigbird or Longformer work, as they are special cases of a single principled structure. An extended discussion of related work is in Appendix A. ## 3 Characterization of Sparse + Low-rank Approx. to Attention Matrices\n\nWe motivate the use of sparse + low-rank approximation of the attention matrices with the key observation that for many attention matrices, sparse and low-rank approximation are complementary, and their ideal combination (via Robust PCA) can outperform both (Section 3.1). Furthermore, we argue that the sparse + low-rank structure can arise naturally when elements in the input sequence form clusters, as dictated by the softmax temperature (Section 3.2. [^1]\n### 3.1 Motivating Observations: Low-rank and Sparse Structures of Attention Matrices\n\nWe empirically characterize regimes where sparse and low-rank approximation are well-suited, based on the softmax temperature (for which we use the softmax distribution entropy is a proxy). Specifically, in Fig. 1 (left), we present the approximation error of the original attention matrices and the approximation (sparse or low-rank) of matrices sampled from a 4-layer Transformer trained on IMDb reviews classification 57. We make two observations:\n\n1. Sparse and low-rank approximation are complementary: sparse excels when the softmax temperature scale is low (i.e., low entropy), and low-rank excels when the softmax temperature is high (i.e., high entropy). 2. An ideal combination of sparse and low-rank (orange line in Fig. 1 left), obtained with robust PCA, can achieve lower error than both. Similar observations on other benchmarks and details are presented in Appendix B. ### 3.2 A Generative Model of How Sparse + Low-rank Structure Can Arise\n\nSparse + low-rank parameterization is more expressive than either sparse or low-rank alone. Indeed, in the Appendix, we construct a family of attention matrices to show the separation between the approximation capability of sparse + low-rank vs. sparse or low-rank alone: for an $n \\times n$ attention matrix, sparse or low-rank alone requires a $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ parameters to get $\\epsilon$ approximation error in Frobenius norm, while sparse + low-rank only requires $O(n)$ parameters. Moreover, we argue here that sparse + low-rank is a natural candidate to approximate generic attention matrices. We describe a generative model of how the sparse + low-rank structure in attention matrices could arise when the elements of the input sequence\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_4420c59ec674bac5f31eg-04.jpg?height=279&width=816&top_left_y=907&top_left_x=1053)\n\nFigure 2: Visualization of the generative process, for three different values of the intra-cluster distance $\\Delta$ (small, medium, and large).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n34\nF Further Discussions and Future Work ..... 34\n\n## A Extended Related Work\n\n## A. 1 Robust PCA\n\nRobust Principle Component Analysis (robust PCA) is the problem of finding a composition of a matrix $M$ into a sum of sparse and low-rank components: $M=S+L$. It is a modification of PCA to accommodate corrupted observations (aka, noise). The sparse part covers the noise, while the low-rank part recovers the principle components. The most popular method to solve the problem is convex relaxation [8, where one minimizes the error $\\|M-S-L\\|_{F}^{2}$ subject to $\\ell_{1}$ constraint on $\\|S\\|_{1}$ and nuclear norm constraint on $\\|L\\|_{*}$, in order to promote the sparsity of $S$ and the low-rankness of $L$. This convex problem can be solved with a variety of methods, such as interior point methods or the method of Augmented Lagrange Multipliers. In our context, to find a sparse + low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix, one can also heuristically \"peel off\" the sparse part by finding the large entries of the attention matrix, then find a low-rank decomposition of the remainder. To avoid materializing the full attention matrix, one can use LSH to find potential locations of large entries, and use matrix completion [52] to find a low-rank decomposition. Gradient descent can find global optimum for this matrix completion problem [23]. However, it still requires too many iterations to be used in each training step. ## A. 2 Efficient Transformers\n\nSparse, Low-rank Approx.: Transformer-based model such as BERT [38 has achieved unprecedented performance in natural language processing. Recently, Vision Transformers [28, 69, has also achieved comparable performance to the traditional convolutional neural network in computer vision tasks [66]. However, the quadratic computation of the attention layers constrains the scalability of Transformers. There are many existing directions to overcome this bottleneck, including attention matrix approximation such as Reformer [36], Performer [17], leveraging a side memory module that can access multiple tokens at once [38, 39, 56] such as Longformer [5] and BigBird [70, segment-based recurrence such as TransformerXL 19 and Compressive Transformer [49. Please refer to a recent survey [58 for more details. In this paper, we mainly explore within the scope of approximating dense or full attention matrices. Existing combination of Sparse and Low-rank Attention: Our focus on the classical and welldefined problem of matrix approximation, as opposed to simply designing an efficient model that performs well on downstream tasks (e.g., Longformer, Luna, Long-short transformer, etc.) affords us several advantages: (i) Easier understanding and theoretical analysis (Section 3, 4). We see that Scatterbrain yields an unbiased estimate of the attention matrix, and we can also understand how its variance changes. (ii) Clear-cut evaluation based on approximation error, as well as the ability to directly replace a full attention layer with Scatterbrain attention without re-training (Section 5). This setting is increasingly important as transformer models are getting larger and training them from scratch has become prohibitively costly. Other methods such as Luna and Long-short transformer are not backward compatible with pre-trained models. Here we compare Scatterbrain with other work mentioned by the reviewer, showing how most of them are special cases of Scatterbrain. We will also add this discussion in the updated version of the manuscript. - Longformer [5: a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local attention, and the low-rank component is the global tokens. Global tokens can be considered a restricted form of low-rank approximation. - BigBird 70: a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local + random sparse attention, and the low-rank component is the global tokens. The use of global tokens makes the model unsuited for autoregressive modeling. On the other hand, Scatterbrain's generality allows it to use other kinds of low-rank attention (e.g., Performer), and thus Scatterbrain works on both the causal/autoregressive and the bidirectional/non-causal attention settings. BigBird's motivation is also quite different from ours: they aim to design efficient attention such that the whole Transformer model is still a universal approximator and is Turing complete. Our goal is more concrete and easier to evaluate: we approximate the attention matrices, to get a small Frobenius error between the Scatterbrain attention and the full attention matrices. - Luna [43 (concurrent work): they use a fixed-length extra sequence and two consecutive attention steps: the context sequence attends to the extra sequence, and then the query sequence attends to the extra sequence. This is similar in spirit to low-rank attention (Linformer) and global tokens, but it is not a\nlow-rank approximation due to the non-linearity between the two attention steps. It is not clear to us that it combines different kinds of attention. - Long-short transformer 71] (concurrent work): a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local attention and the low-rank component is Linformer. ## A. 3 Locality Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Neural Network Training\n\nLocality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has been well-studied in approximate nearest-neighbor search 2, 11, 27, 30, 34, 54. Since the brute-force approach for similarity search is computationally expensive, researchers have come up with various indexing structures to expedite the search process. Usually this comes with trade-offs on the search quality. Based on these indexing structures, one can achieve sub-linear search time. LSH has been used in estimation problem as well [12, 13]. Recently, there has been several work taking advantage of LSH data structures for efficient neural network training. During training process, the weight matrices are slowly modified via gradients derived from objective functions. If we consider the weights as the search data and input as queries, we can view neural network training as a similarity search problem. For example, 14, 18, 41] proposes an algorithm which performs sparse forward and backward computations via maximum inner product search during training. It is based on the observation that the model is usually over-parameterized so the activation for a given input could be sparse and LSH is used to find or impose the sparse structure. Similarly, LSH based algorithms have also been used in Transformers [14, [15], where LSH is used to capture the sparse structure of the attention matrices. They can largely reduce the memory bottleneck of self-attention modules especially over long sequences in Transformer. Though [15] has done some exploration to improve LSH accuracy-efficiency trade-offs through learnable LSH, most of the above works have limited understanding on when and where LSH can perform well. ## A. 4 Structured Matrices for Efficient Machine Learning Models\n\nSparse + low-rank is an example of a class of structured matrices: those with asymptotically fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithm ( $o\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ time complexity) and few parameters ( $o\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ space complexity). Common examples include sparse, low-rank matrices, and matrices based on fast transforms (e.g., Fourier transform, circulant, Toeplitz, Legendre transform, Chebyshev transform, and more generally orthogonal polynomial transforms). These classes of matrices, and their generalization, have been used in machine learning to replace dense matrices in fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers [32, 55, 61. De Sa et al. [24] shows that any structured matrix can be written as product of sparse matrices, and products of sparse matrices even with fixed sparsity pattern have been shown to be effective at parameterizing compressed models [1, 20, 21]. In our setting, it remains difficult to approximate the attention matrix with these more general classes of structured matrices. This is because many of them are fixed (e.g., Fourier transform, orthogonal polynomial transforms), and there lacks efficient algorithms to find the closest structured matrix to a given attention matrix. ## B Motivating Observations: Low-rank and Sparse Structures of Attention Matrices\n\nWe aim to build a deeper understanding of sparse and low-rank structures in real attention matrices: where each of them excel, and the potential for their combination. Specifically, we\n\n- show that sparse and low-rank approximation errors are negatively correlated (through statistical tests),\n- characterize regimes where each of sparse and low-rank approximation are well-suited, as dictated by the entropy of the softmax attention distribution, and\n- demonstrate that sparse + low-rank has the potential to achieve better approximation than either. ## B. 1 Setup\n\nDenote $M$ as the attention matrix (after softmax) and $\\mathcal{H}$ as entropy. We measure approximation error by the Frobenius norm or the original matrix and the approximation (sparse or low-rank). All the observed attention matrices in this section are from (1) a 4-layer vanilla Transformer trained from scratch on char-level IMDb reviews classification [57] (2) a 16-layer vanilla Transformer trained from scratch on WikiText103 45 (3) a 1-layer (attention) pre-trained BigGAN on ImageNet [25]. To collect attention matrices for IMDb and WikiText103, we first save checkpoint of the models in every epoch; then evaluate 100 samples from validate data for each checkpoint and collect attention matrices from each layer each head. Note we take the median of the stats (error) for those 100 samples if it is difficult to visualize. To collect attention matrices for BigGAN, we generate 100 samples and collect the attention on the fly. ## B. 2 Observation 1: Sparse and low-rank approximation errors are negatively correlated\n\nTable 3: The Spearman's rank, Pearson and Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients between Sparse and Low-rank approx. error on IMDb, WikiText-103, and BigGAN-ImageNet.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/51 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nLet the rows of $Q$ be $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{n}$, and the rows of $K$ be $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$.

In particular, let $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ be the autoregressive mask, whose lower triangle is all ones and the rest of the entries are zero. The unnormalized attention matrix is $\\exp \\left(\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right)$, and the unnormalized output is $\\exp \\left(\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V$, where $\\odot$ is elementwise multiplication. The low-rank autoregressive variant computes $\\left(\\left(\\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{K}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V$, though with a custom GPU kernel / implementation so as not to materialize the $n \\times n$ matrix. For the sparse component, we simply mask out locations $S_{i j}$ where $i>j$. That is, we can perform $S \\odot M$ efficiently. As a result, we can compute the Scatterbrain output $\\left(\\left(\\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{K}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V+(S \\odot M) V$ efficiently. ## D Proofs\n\n## D. 1 Expressiveness of Sparse + Low-rank Matrices\n\nTo motivate the use of sparse + low-rank matrices, we describe a family of attention matrices where sparse + low-rank matrices need asymptotically fewer parameters to approximate the attention matrix, compared to sparse or low-rank matrices alone. For there cases, either sparse or low-rank alone requires a quadratic number of parameters $\\left(O\\left(n^{2}\\right)\\right.$, where $n \\times n$ is the dimension of the attention matrix) to get $\\epsilon$ approximation error in Frobenius norm, while sparse + low-rank only requires $O(n)$ parameters. We construct a matrix family that shows the separation between the approximation capability of sparse + low-rank vs. sparse or low-rank alone. More specifically, we will use diagonal + low-rank (a special case of sparse + low-rank). Example 1. Let $\\epsilon$ denote a parameter that satisfies $\\epsilon \\in(0,1 / 2]$. Consider the following randomized construction of a matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with $d \\geq 6 \\epsilon^{-2} \\log n$ and $d=\\Theta\\left(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log n\\right)$, where each entry of $Q$ is picked independently and uniformly at random from $\\{ \\pm 1 / \\sqrt{d}\\}$. Let $M=\\sigma\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)$ where $\\sigma$ is the elementwise exponential function (we first ignore the normalization term of softmax here). It can be shown (e.g. by Hoeffding's inequality) that with high probability\n\n$$\n\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)_{i, j}= \\begin{cases}1, & \\text { if } i=j \\\\ \\epsilon[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon], & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince $M=\\sigma\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)$ where $\\sigma$ is the elementwise exponential function,\n\n$$\nM_{i, j}= \\begin{cases}e, & \\text { if } i=j \\\\ \\in[1-O(\\epsilon), 1+O(\\epsilon)], & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, as the attention matrix $M$ has large diagonal entries, low-rank matrices will not be able to approximate it well. However, the off-diagonals are also of reasonable size, thus making sparse approximation difficult. With sparse + low-rank, we can use the sparse part to represent the diagonal, and the low-rank part to represent the remaining elements, allowing it to approximate this matrix well. We formalize this separation in the theorem below. Theorem 3. Let $M$ be the attention matrix from Example 1. For any $\\gamma \\in[0,1]$, with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$, there exists a sparse + low-rank estimator with $O\\left(\\gamma^{-1} n^{3 / 2} \\log n\\right)$ parameters that achieve $\\gamma \\sqrt{n}$ Frobenius error. For any matrix $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with rank such that $n-\\operatorname{rank}=\\Omega(n)$ (e.g., $R$ has o $\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ parameters), with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$, we have $\\|M-R\\|_{F} \\geq \\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, any matrix $E_{S}$ that has row sparsity $k$ (each row has less than $k$ non-zeros) such that $n-k=\\omega(1)$ (e.g., $E_{\\mathrm{S}}$ has o( $\\left.n^{2}\\right)$ parameters) will have error $\\left\\|M-E_{S}\\right\\|_{F} \\geq \\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$. We see that for any $\\gamma \\in[0,1]$, any low-rank or sparse estimator for $M$ with $\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ parameters has $\\Omega\\left(\\gamma^{-1}\\right)$ times the error of the sparse + low-rank estimator with $O\\left(\\gamma^{-1} n^{1.5} \\log n\\right)$ parameters.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/83 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nMoreover on language modeling (on wikitext-103 Merity et al.

The matrix $A_{i}$ is known as the attention matrix and the softmax is taken row-wise in the product $Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}$.

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.77)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/35 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nFigure 3 also includes a baseline row factoring a matrix of appropriately scaled i.i.d. Gaussian entries, to indicate typical errors for factoring an unstructured matrix. ### 4.2 Neural Network Compression\n\nMany structured matrix approaches have been proposed to replace fully-connected (FC) layers of neural networks, to speed up training and inference, and to reduce the memory consumption. These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: low rank matrix approximation neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

The majority of existing GNNs rely on the implicit homophily assumption. Recent studies have demonstrated that GNNs may struggle to model heterophilous graphs where nodes with different labels are more likely connected. To address this issue, we propose a generic GNN applicable to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN). Our analysis demonstrates that a signed graph\u2019s global label relationship matrix has a low rank. This insight inspires us to predict the label relationship matrix by solving a robust low-rank matrix approximation problem, as prior research has proven that low-rank approximation could achieve perfect recovery under certain conditions. The experimental results reveal that the solution bears a strong resemblance to the label relationship matrix, presenting two advantages for graph modeling: a block diagonal structure and varying distributions of within-class and between-class entries.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. On Learning Over-parameterized Neural Networks: A Functional Approximation Prospective\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Lili Su, Pengkun Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network over-parameterization, and an application of the general results to the setting where $\\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider training over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) using gradient descent (GD) method. Inspired by a recent line of work, we study the evolutions of network prediction errors across GD iterations, which can be neatly described in a matrix form. When the network is sufficiently over-parameterized, these matrices individually approximate {\\em an} integral operator which is determined by the feature vector distribution $\\rho$ only. Consequently, GD method can be viewed as {\\em approximately} applying the powers of this integral operator on the underlying/target function $f^*$ that generates the responses/labels. \nWe show that if $f^*$ admits a low-rank approximation with respect to the eigenspaces of this integral operator, then the empirical risk decreases to this low-rank approximation error at a linear rate which is determined by $f^*$ and $\\rho$ only, i.e., the rate is independent of the sample size $n$. Furthermore, if $f^*$ has zero low-rank approximation error, then, as long as the width of the neural network is $\\Omega(n\\log n)$, the empirical risk decreases to $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network over-parameterization. We provide an application of our general results to the setting where $\\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial.

Low-Rank Approximations for Conditional Feedforward Computation in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Andrew S. Davis, I. Arel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.\n\n**Abstract:** Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions, particularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging. This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio, et. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*James Martens, Roger Grosse*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.\n\n**Published:** 2015-03-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Nystrom Method for Accurate and Scalable Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Makoto Yamada, Ryuichiro Hataya*\n\n**Abstract:** The essential difficulty of gradient-based bilevel optimization using implicit differentiation is to estimate the inverse Hessian vector product with respect to neural network parameters. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by the Nystrom method and the Woodbury matrix identity, exploiting the low-rankness of the Hessian. Compared to existing methods using iterative approximation, such as conjugate gradient and the Neumann series approximation, the proposed method avoids numerical instability and can be efficiently computed in matrix operations without iterations. As a result, the proposed method works stably in various tasks and is faster than iterative approximations. Throughout experiments including large-scale hyperparameter optimization and meta learning, we demonstrate that the Nystrom method consistently achieves comparable or even superior performance to other approaches.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Aniruddh Rao, Alexander Liu, Jessica Grogan, Michael Poli, Arjun Desai, Nimit Sohoni, Beidi Chen, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called \"reverse sparsification,\" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using low-rank matrix approximations, here are some specific techniques and implementations that address the key aspects of theoretical guarantees, memory efficiency, computational complexity, and training stability:\n\n## Theoretical Guarantees\n- The work on \"Weight Decay induces low-rank bias for neural networks\" provides theoretical guarantees that weight decay (WD) in neural networks leads to a low-rank bias in the weight matrices. This is particularly relevant as it shows that the learned weight matrices can be approximated by low-rank matrices without significant loss in performance, which can be generalized to autoregressive language models.\n\n## Memory Efficiency\n- **Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA):** LoRA utilizes low-rank matrix approximations to reduce the parameter complexity of large language models. This method allows for faster and less resource-intensive model customization, which is crucial for improving memory efficiency in autoregressive models.\n- **Tensor-Train Decomposition:** This method can reduce the complexity of matrix operations from \\(O(d^2)\\) to \\(O(dr)\\), where \\(r \\ll d\\), providing significant memory savings. This technique can be applied to the weight matrices in autoregressive language models to achieve better memory efficiency.\n\n## Computational Complexity\n- **Structured Matrix Approximations:** Techniques like butterfly patterns can reduce the computational complexity of matrix operations to \\(O(d \\log d)\\), which is more efficient than traditional methods. These structured matrices maintain the expressivity of the model while improving computational efficiency, making them suitable for autoregressive language models.\n- **Block-Wise Matrix Operations:** Optimizing matrix operations by using block-wise computations can reduce memory bandwidth requirements by 40-60%. This approach, when tailored to the hardware characteristics, can significantly improve the computational efficiency of autoregressive models.\n\n## Training Stability\n- **Stability Mechanisms:** The stability of low-rank matrix operations can be enhanced by ensuring that the training process leads to small batch gradients. The work on weight decay inducing low-rank bias shows that sufficient training with small batch gradients results in stable and generalizable models. This principle can be applied to autoregressive language models to improve training stability.\n- **Regularization Techniques:** Using regularization techniques such as weight decay can help in inducing a low-rank bias, which not only improves generalization but also stabilizes the training process. This is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various datasets, suggesting its applicability to language models.\n\n## Empirical Validation and Benchmarks\n- To validate these techniques, researchers can use benchmarks such as perplexity in corpora and accuracy in downstream tasks. Empirical validation methods should include comparing the performance of models with and without low-rank approximations, measuring metrics such as training time, inference speed, and memory usage.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in terms of memory and computation, more stable during training, and theoretically grounded in their design.\n",

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.24)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/70 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages $1675-1685$.

At their core is an attention function which models pairwise interactions between the inputs at every timestep. While attention is powerful, it does not scale efficiently to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity in the sequence length. We propose RFA, a linear time and space attention that uses random feature methods to approximate the softmax function, and explore its application in transformers. RFA can be used as a drop-in replacement for conventional softmax attention and offers a straightforward way of learning with recency bias through an optional gating mechanism. Experiments on language modeling and machine translation demonstrate that RFA achieves similar or better performance compared to strong transformer baselines. In the machine translation experiment, RFA decodes twice as fast as a vanilla transformer. Compared to existing efficient transformer variants, RFA is competitive in terms of both accuracy and efficiency on three long text classification datasets. Our analysis shows that RFA's efficiency gains are especially notable on long sequences, suggesting that RFA will be particularly useful in tasks that require working with large inputs, fast decoding speed, or low memory footprints.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/40 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP, 2014.

We propose KERPLE, a framework that generalizes relative position embedding for extrapolation by kernelizing positional differences. We achieve this goal using conditionally positive definite (CPD) kernels, a class of functions known for generalizing distance metrics. To maintain the inner product interpretation of self-attention, we show that a CPD kernel can be transformed into a PD kernel by adding a constant offset. This offset is implicitly absorbed in the Softmax normalization during self-attention. The diversity of CPD kernels allows us to derive various RPEs that enable length extrapolation in a principled way. Experiments demonstrate that the logarithmic variant achieves excellent extrapolation performance on three large language modeling datasets.

Spectral State Space Models (Avg.

(2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/31 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nWe provide further details about this study after this section. Spectral filtering. The technique of spectral filtering for learning linear dynamical systems was put forth in [HSZ17]. This work studies online prediction of the sequence of observations $y_{t}$, and the goal is to predict as well as the best symmetric LDS using past inputs and observations. Directly\nlearning the dynamics is a non-convex optimization problem, and spectral filtering is developed as an improper learning technique with an efficient, polynomial-time algorithm and near-optimal regret guarantees. Different from regression-based methods that aim to identify the system dynamics, spectral filtering's guarantee does not depend on the stability of the underlying system, and is the first method to obtain condition number-free regret guarantees for the MIMO setting. Extension to asymmetric dynamical systems was further studied in $\\mathrm{HLS}^{+} 18$. Convolutional Models for Sequence Modeling Exploiting the connnection between Linear dynamical systems and convolutions (as highlighted by [GGR21]) various convolutional models have been proposed for sequence modelling. [FEN ${ }^{+}$23] employ direct learning of convolutional kernels directly to sequence modelling but find that they underperform SSMs. They find the non-smoothness of kernels to be the culprit and propose applying explicit smoothing and squashing operations to the kernels to match performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark. The proposed model still contains significantly large number of parameters growing with the sequence length. [ $\\left.\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ identifies two key characteristics of convolutions to be crucial for long range modelling, decay in filters and small number of parameters parameterizing the kernel. They achieve this via a specific form of the kernel derived by repeating and scaling the kernel in a dyadic fashion. [SWF23] propose a multiresolution kernel structure inspired from the wavelet transform and multiresolution analysis. All these methods parameterize the kernels with specific structures and/or add further regularizations to emulate the convolution kernels implied by SSMs. In contrast our proposed kernels are fixed and thereby parameter-free and the number of parameters scale in the number of kernels and not the size of the kernel. Furthermore our kernels are provably more expressive than linear dynamical systems capable of directly capturing and improving the performance of SSMs without the need for specific initializations. Naturally our kernels (see Fig 1] by default satisfy both the smoothness and the decay condition identified (and explicitly enforced) by $\\left\\lfloor\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right\\rfloor$ and $\\left[\\mathrm{FEN}^{+}\\right.$23]. ## A. 1 Ablations performed by OSG $^{+}$23]\n\nMotivated by the success of SSMs, $\\left[\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23\\right]$ revisit the RNN model (under the same deep stacked structure as SSMs) to investigate their efficiency. They begin from a simple linear RNN (a directly parameterized LDS) and add multiple components inspired from the SSM literature to ensure numerical stability and trainability of the model especially as the sequences grow larger. Overall they demonstrate that carefully designed parameterizations and initializations of LDS parameters as well as specifically designed normalizations are all necessary for model to learn consistently over the LRA dataset and in particularly over the 16 K context length task PathX. These interventions are driven by specific intuitions such as an inductive bias towards larger memory or controlling the loss blowup at initialization under long contexts but as such come with no theoretical guarantees towards alleviating the problem. We provide some quick details towards what these interventions are and refer the reader to $\\left[\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23\\right]$ to understand the motivations behind them and comparisons with similar ideas existing in previous SSM literature. The LRU model considered by $\\left[\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23\\right]$ is given by\n\n$$\ny_{k}=\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda) y_{k-1}+\\gamma \\odot B u_{k}\n$$\n\nIn the above the learned parameters are $\\lambda$ and $B$ and note that $\\operatorname{diag}(\\lambda)$ corresponds to a diagonal $A$. $\\gamma$ is a specific normalization technique they develop to control the loss blowup under long-context detailed below. They perform the following interventions towards stable training\n\n- Stable Exponential Parameterization: They parameterize $\\lambda$ as\n\n$$\n\\lambda_{j}=\\underbrace{\\exp \\left(-\\exp \\left(\\nu_{j}^{\\log }\\right)\\right.}_{\\text {magnitude }}+i \\underbrace{\\exp \\left(\\theta_{j}^{\\log }\\right)}_{\\text {phase }})\n$$\n\nThe above is done to ensure a bound on the magnitude of eigenvalues of the effective A matrix as well as to ensure more resolution in the parameter space closer to the value of 1 . - Ring Initialization: They initialize the $\\lambda_{j}$ in the complex annulus [min_rad, max_rad]. This ensures that at initialization the magnitude of $\\lambda_{j}$ chosen randomly lies in $\\in$ [min_rad, max_rad] and the phase is chosen randomly. When not applying this intervention min_rad and max_rad are chosen to be 0,1 respectively. When applying this intervention these values are chosen to be closer to 1 , e.g. $0.9,0.999$ respectively. - $\\gamma$-Normalization: They set $\\gamma_{j}=\\sqrt{1-\\left|\\lambda_{j}\\right|^{2}}$\n- Restricting Phase at initialization: Instead of drawing a random phase at initialization the authors recommend selecting the initial phase from $[0, \\pi / 10]$. The authors claim that uniform phase inherently biases the network towards learning spurious features in the input sequence. $\\left[\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23\\right]$ provide the following ablation in the paper. In particular we see that all the above interventions are necessary to make the model get to non-trivial accuracy on PathX. On the contrary, as we show the STU model achieves comparable accuracy without requiring any specific initialization or normalization. | Model | Specification | sCIFAR | ListOps | Pathfinder | PathX |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| LRU | Dense A | 72.2 | 50.4 | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ |\n|  | $\\Lambda$ Exp.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/54 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nS.

Excess Risk of Two-Layer ReLU Neural Networks in Teacher-Student Settings and its Superiority to Kernel Methods\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Shunta Akiyama, Taiji Suzuki*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs, and shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator, including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate.\n\n**Abstract:** While deep learning has outperformed other methods for various tasks, theoretical frameworks that explain its reason have not been fully established. To address this issue, we investigate the excess risk of two-layer ReLU neural networks in a teacher-student regression model, in which a student network learns an unknown teacher network through its outputs. Especially, we consider the student network that has the same width as the teacher network and is trained in two phases: first by noisy gradient descent and then by the vanilla gradient descent. Our result shows that the student network provably reaches a near-global optimal solution and outperforms any kernel methods estimator (more generally, linear estimators), including neural tangent kernel approach, random feature model, and other kernel methods, in a sense of the minimax optimal rate. The key concept inducing this superiority is the non-convexity of the neural network models. Even though the loss landscape is highly non-convex, the student network adaptively learns the teacher neurons.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Classifying high-dimensional Gaussian mixtures: Where kernel methods fail and neural networks succeed\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Maria Refinetti, Sebastian Goldt, Florent Krzakala, Lenka Zdeborov'a*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is theoretically shown that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task and illustrates how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Abstract:** A recent series of theoretical works showed that the dynamics of neural networks with a certain initialisation are well-captured by kernel methods. Concurrent empirical work demonstrated that kernel methods can come close to the performance of neural networks on some image classification tasks. These results raise the question of whether neural networks only learn successfully if kernels also learn successfully, despite neural networks being more expressive. Here, we show theoretically that two-layer neural networks (2LNN) with only a few hidden neurons can beat the performance of kernel learning on a simple Gaussian mixture classification task. We study the high-dimensional limit where the number of samples is linearly proportional to the input dimension, and show that while small 2LNN achieve near-optimal performance on this task, lazy training approaches such as random features and kernel methods do not. Our analysis is based on the derivation of a closed set of equations that track the learning dynamics of the 2LNN and thus allow to extract the asymptotic performance of the network as a function of signal-to-noise ratio and other hyperparameters. We finally illustrate how over-parametrising the neural network leads to faster convergence, but does not improve its final performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

When do neural networks outperform kernel methods?\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*B. Ghorbani, Song Mei, Theodor Misiakiewicz, A. Montanari*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that this curse of dimensionality becomes milder if the covariates display the same low-dimensional structure as the target function, and a spiked covariates model is presented that can capture in a unified framework both behaviors observed in earlier work.\n\n**Abstract:** For a certain scaling of the initialization of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), wide neural networks (NN) have been shown to be well approximated by reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods. Recent empirical work showed that, for some classification tasks, RKHS methods can replace NNs without a large loss in performance. On the other hand, two-layers NNs are known to encode richer smoothness classes than RKHS and we know of special examples for which SGD-trained NN provably outperform RKHS. This is true even in the wide network limit, for a different scaling of the initialization. How can we reconcile the above claims? For which tasks do NNs outperform RKHS? If covariates are nearly isotropic, RKHS methods suffer from the curse of dimensionality, while NNs can overcome it by learning the best low-dimensional representation. Here we show that this curse of dimensionality becomes milder if the covariates display the same low-dimensional structure as the target function, and we precisely characterize this tradeoff. Building on these results, we present the spiked covariates model that can capture in a unified framework both behaviors observed in earlier work. We hypothesize that such a latent low-dimensional structure is present in image classification. We test numerically this hypothesis by showing that specific perturbations of the training distribution degrade the performances of RKHS methods much more significantly than NNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 173  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 5. Stability & Generalisation of Gradient Descent for Shallow Neural Networks without the Neural Tangent Kernel\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Dominic Richards, Ilja Kuzborskij*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work revisits on-average algorithmic stability of GD for training overparameterised shallow neural networks and shows oracle type bounds which reveal that the generalisation and excess risk of GD is controlled by an interpolating network with the shortest GD path from initialisation.\n\n**Abstract:** We revisit on-average algorithmic stability of GD for training overparameterised shallow neural networks and prove new generalisation and excess risk bounds without the NTK or PL assumptions. In particular, we show oracle type bounds which reveal that the generalisation and excess risk of GD is controlled by an interpolating network with the shortest GD path from initialisation (in a sense, an interpolating network with the smallest relative norm). While this was known for kernelised interpolants, our proof applies directly to networks trained by GD without intermediate kernelisation. At the same time, by relaxing oracle inequalities developed here we recover existing NTK-based risk bounds in a straightforward way, which demonstrates that our analysis is tighter. Finally, unlike most of the NTK-based analyses we focus on regression with label noise and show that GD with early stopping is consistent.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Blind Image Deblurring with Unknown Kernel Size and Substantial Noise\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Ju Sun, Hengkang Wang, Taihui Li, Zhong Zhuang*\n\n**Abstract:** Blind image deblurring (BID) has been extensively studied in computer vision and adjacent fields. Modern methods for BID can be grouped into two categories: single-instance methods that deal with individual instances using statistical inference and numerical optimization, and data-driven methods that train deep-learning models to deblur future instances directly. Data-driven methods can be free from the difficulty in deriving accurate blur models, but are fundamentally limited by the diversity and quality of the training data -- collecting sufficiently expressive and realistic training data is a standing challenge. In this paper, we focus on single-instance methods that remain competitive and indispensable. However, most such methods do not prescribe how to deal with unknown kernel size and substantial noise, precluding practical deployment. Indeed, we show that several state-of-the-art (SOTA) single-instance methods are unstable when the kernel size is overspecified, and/or the noise level is high. On the positive side, we propose a practical BID method that is stable against both, the first of its kind. Our method builds on the recent ideas of solving inverse problems by integrating the physical models and structured deep neural networks, without extra training data. We introduce several crucial modifications to achieve the desired stability. Extensive empirical tests on standard synthetic datasets, as well as real-world NTIRE2020 and RealBlur datasets, show the superior effectiveness and practicality of our BID method compared to SOTA single-instance as well as data-driven methods.

Do Wider Neural Networks Really Help Adversarial Robustness?\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Quanquan Gu, Xiaofei He, Deng Cai, Jinghui Chen, Boxi Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Adversarial training is a powerful type of defense against adversarial examples. Previous empirical results suggest that adversarial training requires wider networks for better performances. However, it remains elusive how neural network width affects model robustness. In this paper, we carefully examine the relationship between network width and model robustness. Specifically, we show that the model robustness is closely related to the tradeoff between natural accuracy and perturbation stability, which is controlled by the robust regularization parameter $\\lambda$. With the same $\\lambda$, wider networks can achieve better natural accuracy but worse perturbation stability, leading to a potentially worse overall model robustness. To understand the origin of this phenomenon, we further relate the perturbation stability with the network's local Lipschitzness. By leveraging recent results on neural tangent kernels, we theoretically show that wider networks tend to have worse perturbation stability. Our analyses suggest that: 1) the common strategy of first fine-tuning $\\lambda$ on small networks and then directly use it for wide model training could lead to deteriorated model robustness; 2) one needs to properly enlarge $\\lambda$ to unleash the robustness potential of wider models fully. Finally, we propose a new Width Adjusted Regularization (WAR) method that adaptively enlarges $\\lambda$ on wide models and significantly saves the tuning time.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. ZITS++: Image Inpainting by Improving the Incremental Transformer on Structural Priors\n\n*From Search Query: kernel methods neural networks stability*\n\n*Yanwei Fu, Qiaole Dong, Chenjie Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Image inpainting involves filling missing areas of a corrupted image. Despite impressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both vivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge. Previous methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an improved model upon our conference work, ZITS. Specifically, given one corrupt image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To recover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) module, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention convolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized with the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular masks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting ability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore the effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to utilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive experiments. This investigation is orthogonal to most inpainting approaches and can thus significantly benefit the community.

By interpreting RNNs as continuous-time neural differential equations, it is possible to view the solution of an RNN as a linear function of a specific feature set of the input sequence, known as the signature. This approach allows for stability guarantees in a suitable reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS).\n\n### Integration of Kernel Methods with Deep Networks\nCombining kernel methods with deep neural networks can enhance stability. For instance, using a deep module as the front end and a kernel machine as the back end can provide more stable results. This hybrid approach leverages the rigorous theoretical foundation of kernel methods to stabilize the deep learning models.\n\n## Adaptive Parameter Selection\n\n### Deep Kernel Learning (DKL)\nThe DKL approach involves data reduction, localization of the predictive function, and reduction of the error function. This method uses a regularization constraint to enforce the matching of solutions between adjacent subproblems, which can be solved in parallel. This adaptive approach allows for dynamic adjustment of parameters based on the local error functions, improving the accuracy-per-parameter metric.\n\n### Multi-Kernel Learning\nSelecting or combining multiple kernel functions can enhance adaptability. Multi-kernel learning involves choosing several high-performing kernel functions or combining different kernel functions to improve interpretability, dimensionality reduction, and prediction performance. This approach allows for adaptive parameter selection based on the specific problem and dataset characteristics.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency\n\n### Block-Wise Operations and Parallel Processing\nThe DKL approach described in involves partitioning the domain and solving smaller problems in parallel. This method uses a nearest-neighbourhood communication scheme, which does not require a fully connected network, reducing communication overhead and improving hardware efficiency. The use of block-wise operations optimized for hardware, such as those in convolutional neural networks (CNNs), can also enhance efficiency.\n\n### Structured Matrices and Block Cyclic Distribution\nUsing structured matrices with block cyclic distribution, as in CNNs, can optimize matrix operations for distributed-memory architectures. This approach allows for the use of Level 3 BLAS during computations on a single node, improving hardware efficiency.\n\n## Error Bounds and Convergence Guarantees\n\n### Theoretical Guarantees in RKHS\nFraming RNNs as kernel methods provides theoretical guarantees on generalization and stability within an RKHS. This approach ensures that the solution of the RNN can be viewed as a linear function of the input sequence's signature, offering clear error bounds and convergence guarantees.\n\n### Tikhonov Regularization and Inverse Problems\nThe DKL framework casts deep learning problems into a functional analysis framework, exploiting the connection with Tikhonov regularization. This approach formulates DKL problems as concatenated Tikhonov regularization functionals, providing a rigorous theoretical basis for error bounds and convergence guarantees.\n\nIn summary, integrating kernel methods with deep neural networks can enhance stability, adaptability, and hardware efficiency. Techniques such as framing RNNs as kernel methods, using multi-kernel learning, and employing block-wise operations with parallel processing can be particularly effective. These approaches provide strong theoretical foundations, including error bounds and convergence guarantees, which are crucial for improving autoregressive language model design.\n",

FLuRKA: Fast and accurate unified Low-Rank&Kernel Attention (Avg.

Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/83 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nMoreover on language modeling (on wikitext-103 Merity et al. [2016]), language understanding (on GLUE Wang et al. 2018]), long sequence modeling (on LRA Tay et al. 2020c|), machine translation (on\nenglish to german and english to french) and image classification (on imagenet Russakovsky et al. [2015]), FLuRKA are competitive with, and occasionally surpass, the low-rank and kernel methods that compose them. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\nThe backbone of the transformer is multi-head-self-attention (MHSA) Vaswani et al. 2017. MHSA computes the following matrix: Concat $\\left(\\operatorname{Head}_{1}\\right.$, Head $_{2}, \\ldots$, Head $\\left._{h}\\right)$ where $\\mathrm{Head}_{i}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}\\right)}_{A_{i}} V W_{i}^{V}\n$$\n\nThe matrices $Q, K \\& V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{m}}$ are the input matrices consisting of $N$ points embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{m}}$, where $d_{m}$ and $N$ are known as the embedding dimension and sequence length respectively. $W_{i}^{Q}$, $W_{i}^{K}$ and $W_{i}^{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{m} \\times d_{h}}$ are linear transformations. The matrix $A_{i}$ is known as the attention matrix and the softmax is taken row-wise in the product $Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}$. Self-attention is expensive due to the matrix $A_{i}$ being of size $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. ### 2.1 Efficient Approximations\n\nLow-rank Methods Low-rank methods exploit the observation that the matrix $A_{i}$ is of low-rank. Motivated by this, linformer [Wang et al., 2020], a SOTA low-rank technique, constructs a low-rank approximation of $\\mathrm{Head}_{i}$ via:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(E_{1} K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}\\right) E_{2} V W_{i}^{V}\n$$\n\nWhere $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{k} \\times N}$ whose entries are sampled from $N\\left(0, \\frac{1}{d_{k}}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 2. Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 93  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, Scatterbrain is proposed, a novel way to unify sparse and low-rank attention for accurate and efficient approximation and is unbiased with provably low error.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity or low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and memory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n34\nF Further Discussions and Future Work ..... 34\n\n## A Extended Related Work\n\n## A. 1 Robust PCA\n\nRobust Principle Component Analysis (robust PCA) is the problem of finding a composition of a matrix $M$ into a sum of sparse and low-rank components: $M=S+L$. It is a modification of PCA to accommodate corrupted observations (aka, noise). The sparse part covers the noise, while the low-rank part recovers the principle components. The most popular method to solve the problem is convex relaxation [8, where one minimizes the error $\\|M-S-L\\|_{F}^{2}$ subject to $\\ell_{1}$ constraint on $\\|S\\|_{1}$ and nuclear norm constraint on $\\|L\\|_{*}$, in order to promote the sparsity of $S$ and the low-rankness of $L$. This convex problem can be solved with a variety of methods, such as interior point methods or the method of Augmented Lagrange Multipliers. In our context, to find a sparse + low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix, one can also heuristically \"peel off\" the sparse part by finding the large entries of the attention matrix, then find a low-rank decomposition of the remainder. To avoid materializing the full attention matrix, one can use LSH to find potential locations of large entries, and use matrix completion [52] to find a low-rank decomposition. Gradient descent can find global optimum for this matrix completion problem [23]. However, it still requires too many iterations to be used in each training step. ## A. 2 Efficient Transformers\n\nSparse, Low-rank Approx.: Transformer-based model such as BERT [38 has achieved unprecedented performance in natural language processing. Recently, Vision Transformers [28, 69, has also achieved comparable performance to the traditional convolutional neural network in computer vision tasks [66]. However, the quadratic computation of the attention layers constrains the scalability of Transformers. There are many existing directions to overcome this bottleneck, including attention matrix approximation such as Reformer [36], Performer [17], leveraging a side memory module that can access multiple tokens at once [38, 39, 56] such as Longformer [5] and BigBird [70, segment-based recurrence such as TransformerXL 19 and Compressive Transformer [49. Please refer to a recent survey [58 for more details. In this paper, we mainly explore within the scope of approximating dense or full attention matrices. Existing combination of Sparse and Low-rank Attention: Our focus on the classical and welldefined problem of matrix approximation, as opposed to simply designing an efficient model that performs well on downstream tasks (e.g., Longformer, Luna, Long-short transformer, etc.) affords us several advantages: (i) Easier understanding and theoretical analysis (Section 3, 4). We see that Scatterbrain yields an unbiased estimate of the attention matrix, and we can also understand how its variance changes. (ii) Clear-cut evaluation based on approximation error, as well as the ability to directly replace a full attention layer with Scatterbrain attention without re-training (Section 5). This setting is increasingly important as transformer models are getting larger and training them from scratch has become prohibitively costly. Other methods such as Luna and Long-short transformer are not backward compatible with pre-trained models. Here we compare Scatterbrain with other work mentioned by the reviewer, showing how most of them are special cases of Scatterbrain. We will also add this discussion in the updated version of the manuscript. - Longformer [5: a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local attention, and the low-rank component is the global tokens. Global tokens can be considered a restricted form of low-rank approximation. - BigBird 70: a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local + random sparse attention, and the low-rank component is the global tokens. The use of global tokens makes the model unsuited for autoregressive modeling. On the other hand, Scatterbrain's generality allows it to use other kinds of low-rank attention (e.g., Performer), and thus Scatterbrain works on both the causal/autoregressive and the bidirectional/non-causal attention settings. BigBird's motivation is also quite different from ours: they aim to design efficient attention such that the whole Transformer model is still a universal approximator and is Turing complete. Our goal is more concrete and easier to evaluate: we approximate the attention matrices, to get a small Frobenius error between the Scatterbrain attention and the full attention matrices. - Luna [43 (concurrent work): they use a fixed-length extra sequence and two consecutive attention steps: the context sequence attends to the extra sequence, and then the query sequence attends to the extra sequence. This is similar in spirit to low-rank attention (Linformer) and global tokens, but it is not a\nlow-rank approximation due to the non-linearity between the two attention steps. It is not clear to us that it combines different kinds of attention. - Long-short transformer 71] (concurrent work): a special case of Scatterbrain where the sparse component is local attention and the low-rank component is Linformer. ## A. 3 Locality Sensitive Hashing for Efficient Neural Network Training\n\nLocality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) has been well-studied in approximate nearest-neighbor search 2, 11, 27, 30, 34, 54. Since the brute-force approach for similarity search is computationally expensive, researchers have come up with various indexing structures to expedite the search process. Usually this comes with trade-offs on the search quality. Based on these indexing structures, one can achieve sub-linear search time. LSH has been used in estimation problem as well [12, 13]. Recently, there has been several work taking advantage of LSH data structures for efficient neural network training. During training process, the weight matrices are slowly modified via gradients derived from objective functions. If we consider the weights as the search data and input as queries, we can view neural network training as a similarity search problem. For example, 14, 18, 41] proposes an algorithm which performs sparse forward and backward computations via maximum inner product search during training. It is based on the observation that the model is usually over-parameterized so the activation for a given input could be sparse and LSH is used to find or impose the sparse structure. Similarly, LSH based algorithms have also been used in Transformers [14, [15], where LSH is used to capture the sparse structure of the attention matrices. They can largely reduce the memory bottleneck of self-attention modules especially over long sequences in Transformer. Though [15] has done some exploration to improve LSH accuracy-efficiency trade-offs through learnable LSH, most of the above works have limited understanding on when and where LSH can perform well. ## A. 4 Structured Matrices for Efficient Machine Learning Models\n\nSparse + low-rank is an example of a class of structured matrices: those with asymptotically fast matrix-vector multiplication algorithm ( $o\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ time complexity) and few parameters ( $o\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ space complexity). Common examples include sparse, low-rank matrices, and matrices based on fast transforms (e.g., Fourier transform, circulant, Toeplitz, Legendre transform, Chebyshev transform, and more generally orthogonal polynomial transforms). These classes of matrices, and their generalization, have been used in machine learning to replace dense matrices in fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers [32, 55, 61. De Sa et al. [24] shows that any structured matrix can be written as product of sparse matrices, and products of sparse matrices even with fixed sparsity pattern have been shown to be effective at parameterizing compressed models [1, 20, 21]. In our setting, it remains difficult to approximate the attention matrix with these more general classes of structured matrices. This is because many of them are fixed (e.g., Fourier transform, orthogonal polynomial transforms), and there lacks efficient algorithms to find the closest structured matrix to a given attention matrix. ## B Motivating Observations: Low-rank and Sparse Structures of Attention Matrices\n\nWe aim to build a deeper understanding of sparse and low-rank structures in real attention matrices: where each of them excel, and the potential for their combination. Specifically, we\n\n- show that sparse and low-rank approximation errors are negatively correlated (through statistical tests),\n- characterize regimes where each of sparse and low-rank approximation are well-suited, as dictated by the entropy of the softmax attention distribution, and\n- demonstrate that sparse + low-rank has the potential to achieve better approximation than either. ## B. 1 Setup\n\nDenote $M$ as the attention matrix (after softmax) and $\\mathcal{H}$ as entropy. We measure approximation error by the Frobenius norm or the original matrix and the approximation (sparse or low-rank). All the observed attention matrices in this section are from (1) a 4-layer vanilla Transformer trained from scratch on char-level IMDb reviews classification [57] (2) a 16-layer vanilla Transformer trained from scratch on WikiText103 45 (3) a 1-layer (attention) pre-trained BigGAN on ImageNet [25]. To collect attention matrices for IMDb and WikiText103, we first save checkpoint of the models in every epoch; then evaluate 100 samples from validate data for each checkpoint and collect attention matrices from each layer each head. Note we take the median of the stats (error) for those 100 samples if it is difficult to visualize. To collect attention matrices for BigGAN, we generate 100 samples and collect the attention on the fly. ## B. 2 Observation 1: Sparse and low-rank approximation errors are negatively correlated\n\nTable 3: The Spearman's rank, Pearson and Kendall's Tau correlation coefficients between Sparse and Low-rank approx. error on IMDb, WikiText-103, and BigGAN-ImageNet.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/51 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nLet the rows of $Q$ be $q_{1}, \\ldots, q_{n}$, and the rows of $K$ be $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$.

In particular, let $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ be the autoregressive mask, whose lower triangle is all ones and the rest of the entries are zero. The unnormalized attention matrix is $\\exp \\left(\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right)$, and the unnormalized output is $\\exp \\left(\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V$, where $\\odot$ is elementwise multiplication. The low-rank autoregressive variant computes $\\left(\\left(\\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{K}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V$, though with a custom GPU kernel / implementation so as not to materialize the $n \\times n$ matrix. For the sparse component, we simply mask out locations $S_{i j}$ where $i>j$. That is, we can perform $S \\odot M$ efficiently. As a result, we can compute the Scatterbrain output $\\left(\\left(\\widetilde{Q} \\widetilde{K}^{\\top}\\right) \\odot M\\right) V+(S \\odot M) V$ efficiently. ## D Proofs\n\n## D. 1 Expressiveness of Sparse + Low-rank Matrices\n\nTo motivate the use of sparse + low-rank matrices, we describe a family of attention matrices where sparse + low-rank matrices need asymptotically fewer parameters to approximate the attention matrix, compared to sparse or low-rank matrices alone. For there cases, either sparse or low-rank alone requires a quadratic number of parameters $\\left(O\\left(n^{2}\\right)\\right.$, where $n \\times n$ is the dimension of the attention matrix) to get $\\epsilon$ approximation error in Frobenius norm, while sparse + low-rank only requires $O(n)$ parameters. We construct a matrix family that shows the separation between the approximation capability of sparse + low-rank vs. sparse or low-rank alone. More specifically, we will use diagonal + low-rank (a special case of sparse + low-rank). Example 1. Let $\\epsilon$ denote a parameter that satisfies $\\epsilon \\in(0,1 / 2]$. Consider the following randomized construction of a matrix $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$ with $d \\geq 6 \\epsilon^{-2} \\log n$ and $d=\\Theta\\left(\\epsilon^{-2} \\log n\\right)$, where each entry of $Q$ is picked independently and uniformly at random from $\\{ \\pm 1 / \\sqrt{d}\\}$. Let $M=\\sigma\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)$ where $\\sigma$ is the elementwise exponential function (we first ignore the normalization term of softmax here). It can be shown (e.g. by Hoeffding's inequality) that with high probability\n\n$$\n\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)_{i, j}= \\begin{cases}1, & \\text { if } i=j \\\\ \\epsilon[-\\epsilon, \\epsilon], & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nSince $M=\\sigma\\left(Q Q^{\\top}\\right)$ where $\\sigma$ is the elementwise exponential function,\n\n$$\nM_{i, j}= \\begin{cases}e, & \\text { if } i=j \\\\ \\in[1-O(\\epsilon), 1+O(\\epsilon)], & \\text { otherwise }\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, as the attention matrix $M$ has large diagonal entries, low-rank matrices will not be able to approximate it well. However, the off-diagonals are also of reasonable size, thus making sparse approximation difficult. With sparse + low-rank, we can use the sparse part to represent the diagonal, and the low-rank part to represent the remaining elements, allowing it to approximate this matrix well. We formalize this separation in the theorem below. Theorem 3. Let $M$ be the attention matrix from Example 1. For any $\\gamma \\in[0,1]$, with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$, there exists a sparse + low-rank estimator with $O\\left(\\gamma^{-1} n^{3 / 2} \\log n\\right)$ parameters that achieve $\\gamma \\sqrt{n}$ Frobenius error. For any matrix $R \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ with rank such that $n-\\operatorname{rank}=\\Omega(n)$ (e.g., $R$ has o $\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ parameters), with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$, we have $\\|M-R\\|_{F} \\geq \\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$. Moreover, any matrix $E_{S}$ that has row sparsity $k$ (each row has less than $k$ non-zeros) such that $n-k=\\omega(1)$ (e.g., $E_{\\mathrm{S}}$ has o( $\\left.n^{2}\\right)$ parameters) will have error $\\left\\|M-E_{S}\\right\\|_{F} \\geq \\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ with probability at least $1-n^{-1}$. We see that for any $\\gamma \\in[0,1]$, any low-rank or sparse estimator for $M$ with $\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ parameters has $\\Omega\\left(\\gamma^{-1}\\right)$ times the error of the sparse + low-rank estimator with $O\\left(\\gamma^{-1} n^{1.5} \\log n\\right)$ parameters.\n```\n\n#### 3.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/35 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nFigure 3 also includes a baseline row factoring a matrix of appropriately scaled i.i.d. Gaussian entries, to indicate typical errors for factoring an unstructured matrix. ### 4.2 Neural Network Compression\n\nMany structured matrix approaches have been proposed to replace fully-connected (FC) layers of neural networks, to speed up training and inference, and to reduce the memory consumption. These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: low rank matrix approximation neural networks\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Predicting Global Label Relationship Matrix for Graph Neural Networks under Heterophily\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Langzhang Liang, Xiangjing Hu, Zenglin Xu, Zixing Song, Irwin King*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a generic GNN applicable to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN), and demonstrates that a signed graph\u2019s global label relationship matrix has a low rank.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to achieve remarkable performance on node classification tasks by exploiting both graph structures and node features. The majority of existing GNNs rely on the implicit homophily assumption. Recent studies have demonstrated that GNNs may struggle to model heterophilous graphs where nodes with different labels are more likely connected. To address this issue, we propose a generic GNN applicable to both homophilous and heterophilous graphs, namely Low-Rank Graph Neural Network (LRGNN). Our analysis demonstrates that a signed graph\u2019s global label relationship matrix has a low rank. This insight inspires us to predict the label relationship matrix by solving a robust low-rank matrix approximation problem, as prior research has proven that low-rank approximation could achieve perfect recovery under certain conditions. The experimental results reveal that the solution bears a strong resemblance to the label relationship matrix, presenting two advantages for graph modeling: a block diagonal structure and varying distributions of within-class and between-class entries.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. On Learning Over-parameterized Neural Networks: A Functional Approximation Prospective\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Lili Su, Pengkun Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network over-parameterization, and an application of the general results to the setting where $\\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider training over-parameterized two-layer neural networks with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) using gradient descent (GD) method. Inspired by a recent line of work, we study the evolutions of network prediction errors across GD iterations, which can be neatly described in a matrix form. When the network is sufficiently over-parameterized, these matrices individually approximate {\\em an} integral operator which is determined by the feature vector distribution $\\rho$ only. Consequently, GD method can be viewed as {\\em approximately} applying the powers of this integral operator on the underlying/target function $f^*$ that generates the responses/labels. \nWe show that if $f^*$ admits a low-rank approximation with respect to the eigenspaces of this integral operator, then the empirical risk decreases to this low-rank approximation error at a linear rate which is determined by $f^*$ and $\\rho$ only, i.e., the rate is independent of the sample size $n$. Furthermore, if $f^*$ has zero low-rank approximation error, then, as long as the width of the neural network is $\\Omega(n\\log n)$, the empirical risk decreases to $\\Theta(1/\\sqrt{n})$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result showing the sufficiency of nearly-linear network over-parameterization. We provide an application of our general results to the setting where $\\rho$ is the uniform distribution on the spheres and $f^*$ is a polynomial.

Low-Rank Approximations for Conditional Feedforward Computation in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Andrew S. Davis, I. Arel*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.\n\n**Abstract:** Scalability properties of deep neural networks raise key research questions, particularly as the problems considered become larger and more challenging. This paper expands on the idea of conditional computation introduced by Bengio, et. al., where the nodes of a deep network are augmented by a set of gating units that determine when a node should be calculated. By factorizing the weight matrix into a low-rank approximation, an estimation of the sign of the pre-nonlinearity activation can be efficiently obtained. For networks using rectified-linear hidden units, this implies that the computation of a hidden unit with an estimated negative pre-nonlinearity can be ommitted altogether, as its value will become zero when nonlinearity is applied. For sparse neural networks, this can result in considerable speed gains. Experimental results using the MNIST and SVHN data sets with a fully-connected deep neural network demonstrate the performance robustness of the proposed scheme with respect to the error introduced by the conditional computation process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Optimizing Neural Networks with Kronecker-factored Approximate Curvature\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*James Martens, Roger Grosse*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an efficient method for approximating natural gradient descent in neural networks which we call Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC). K-FAC is based on an efficiently invertible approximation of a neural network's Fisher information matrix which is neither diagonal nor low-rank, and in some cases is completely non-sparse. It is derived by approximating various large blocks of the Fisher (corresponding to entire layers) as being the Kronecker product of two much smaller matrices. While only several times more expensive to compute than the plain stochastic gradient, the updates produced by K-FAC make much more progress optimizing the objective, which results in an algorithm that can be much faster than stochastic gradient descent with momentum in practice. And unlike some previously proposed approximate natural-gradient/Newton methods which use high-quality non-diagonal curvature matrices (such as Hessian-free optimization), K-FAC works very well in highly stochastic optimization regimes. This is because the cost of storing and inverting K-FAC's approximation to the curvature matrix does not depend on the amount of data used to estimate it, which is a feature typically associated only with diagonal or low-rank approximations to the curvature matrix.\n\n**Published:** 2015-03-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Nystrom Method for Accurate and Scalable Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Makoto Yamada, Ryuichiro Hataya*\n\n**Abstract:** The essential difficulty of gradient-based bilevel optimization using implicit differentiation is to estimate the inverse Hessian vector product with respect to neural network parameters. This paper proposes to tackle this problem by the Nystrom method and the Woodbury matrix identity, exploiting the low-rankness of the Hessian. Compared to existing methods using iterative approximation, such as conjugate gradient and the Neumann series approximation, the proposed method avoids numerical instability and can be efficiently computed in matrix operations without iterations. As a result, the proposed method works stably in various tasks and is faster than iterative approximations. Throughout experiments including large-scale hyperparameter optimization and meta learning, we demonstrate that the Nystrom method consistently achieves comparable or even superior performance to other approaches.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: low rank matrix approximation neural networks*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Aniruddh Rao, Alexander Liu, Jessica Grogan, Michael Poli, Arjun Desai, Nimit Sohoni, Beidi Chen, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called \"reverse sparsification,\" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using low-rank matrix approximations, here are some specific techniques and implementations that address the key aspects of computational efficiency, memory reduction, approximation quality, and training stability:\n\n## Computational Efficiency\n\n### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nLoRA is a technique that significantly reduces the computational complexity of fine-tuning large pre-trained neural networks. It achieves this by decomposing the weight matrices into low-rank matrices, reducing the number of trainable parameters from \\(d \\times q\\) to \\(r \\times (d + q)\\), where \\(r \\ll \\min(d, q)\\).\n- This method allows for faster and less resource-intensive model customization, making it highly efficient for training and inference.\n\n### Low-Rank Kalman Optimizer (LoKO)\nLoKO leverages low-rank decomposition in LoRA and applies a diagonal approximation of the covariance matrix to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in the number of trainable parameters. This approach enables efficient online fine-tuning of large models with fewer iterations and better performance.\n\n## Memory Reduction\n\n### Low-Rank Matrix Factorization\nUsing low-rank matrix factorization, such as in LoRA, reduces the memory usage by only updating a small subset of the model's parameters. This is achieved by introducing two smaller matrices \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) instead of the full weight matrix \\(W\\), significantly reducing the memory footprint.\n\n### Linear Layer-Wise Rank\nAssigning a linearly increasing rank across different layers of the model can further optimize memory usage. Early layers tend to have lower ranks, allowing for more efficient memory allocation without compromising performance.\n\n## Approximation Quality\n\n### SVD Initialization\nInitializing low-rank matrices with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) helps in maintaining the approximation quality. This method ensures that the low-rank matrices capture the most significant information from the original weight matrices, leading to better performance even with reduced ranks.\n\n### Adaptive Rank Assignment\nAssigning ranks adaptively based on the layer's position in the model can help in maintaining the approximation quality. For example, multi-headed self-attention (MHSA) layers tend to have lower ranks than feed-forward network (FFN) layers, and early blocks generally have lower ranks than later blocks.\n\n## Training Stability\n\n### Diagonal Approximation of Covariance Matrix\nIn LoKO, using a diagonal approximation of the covariance matrix helps in stabilizing the training process. This approximation reduces both computational and storage costs and ensures that the covariance matrix asymptotically approaches a block-diagonal configuration, enhancing stability.\n\n### Robust Initialization and Noise Estimation\nRobust initialization of the covariance matrix and accurate estimation of the observation noise covariance are crucial for the stability of the Kalman filter-based methods like LoKO. These approaches help in ensuring that the model converges with fewer iterations and yields better performance.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are computationally efficient, memory-efficient, maintain high approximation quality, and exhibit stable training behavior. These methods are particularly beneficial for fine-tuning large pre-trained models on specific tasks without the need for full parameter updates.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive rank selection neural networks stability*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Rank Selections for Low-Rank Approximation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive rank selection neural networks stability*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Ting Hua, Yen-Chang Hsu, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework that achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants and retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Abstract:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or its weighted variants has significantly progressed in compressing language models. Previous works assume the same importance for all operations and assign the same number of ranks for different layers in a language model. However, such a uniform rank selection is sub-optimal since different operations (layers) have non-uniform demand in capacity. In other words, a desired SVD strategy should allocate more ranks for important operations and vice versa. However, a globally-optimized selection of ranks for neural networks is still an open problem, and this is a non-trivial challenge since the selection is discrete. In this work, we propose a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework. Our strategy uses a novel regularization to enable the masking to comply with the SVD property where the ranks have sorted singular values. The experiments examined both types of language models, encoder-only and decoder-only models, including large language models like LLaMA. Our compressed model achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants. More interestingly, our method retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. At Stability's Edge: How to Adjust Hyperparameters to Preserve Minima Selection in Asynchronous Training of Neural Networks?\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive rank selection neural networks stability*\n\n*Niv Giladi, M. S. Nacson, Elad Hoffer, Daniel Soudry*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines asynchronous training from the perspective of dynamical stability and finds that the degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of minima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Background: Recent developments have made it possible to accelerate neural networks training significantly using large batch sizes and data parallelism. Training in an asynchronous fashion, where delay occurs, can make training even more scalable. However, asynchronous training has its pitfalls, mainly a degradation in generalization, even after convergence of the algorithm. This gap remains not well understood, as theoretical analysis so far mainly focused on the convergence rate of asynchronous methods. Contributions: We examine asynchronous training from the perspective of dynamical stability. We find that the degree of delay interacts with the learning rate, to change the set of minima accessible by an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent algorithm. We derive closed-form rules on how the learning rate could be changed, while keeping the accessible set the same. Specifically, for high delay values, we find that the learning rate should be kept inversely proportional to the delay. We then extend this analysis to include momentum. We find momentum should be either turned off, or modified to improve training stability. We provide empirical experiments to validate our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. ProtoGate: Prototype-based Neural Networks with Global-to-local Feature Selection for Tabular Biomedical Data\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive rank selection neural networks stability*\n\n*Xiangjian Jiang, Andrei Margeloiu, Nikola Simidjievski, M. Jamnik*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results show that ProtoGate generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy by a clear margin while providing high-fidelity feature selection and explainable predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** Tabular biomedical data poses challenges in machine learning because it is often high-dimensional and typically low-sample-size (HDLSS). Previous research has attempted to address these challenges via local feature selection, but existing approaches often fail to achieve optimal performance due to their limitation in identifying globally important features and their susceptibility to the co-adaptation problem. In this paper, we propose ProtoGate, a prototype-based neural model for feature selection on HDLSS data. ProtoGate first selects instance-wise features via adaptively balancing global and local feature selection. Furthermore, ProtoGate employs a non-parametric prototype-based prediction mechanism to tackle the co-adaptation problem, ensuring the feature selection results and predictions are consistent with underlying data clusters. We conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate the performance and interpretability of ProtoGate on synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that ProtoGate generally outperforms state-of-the-art methods in prediction accuracy by a clear margin while providing high-fidelity feature selection and explainable predictions.

Consistent Feature Selection for Analytic Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive rank selection neural networks stability*\n\n*Vu C. Dinh, L. Ho*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that for a wide class of networks, including deep feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural Networks, and a major sub-class of residual neural network, the Adaptive Group Lasso selection procedure with GroupLasso as the base estimator is selection-consistent.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the most important steps toward interpretability and explainability of neural network models is feature selection, which aims to identify the subset of relevant features. Theoretical results in the field have mostly focused on the prediction aspect of the problem with virtually no work on feature selection consistency for deep neural networks due to the model's severe nonlinearity and unidentifiability. This lack of theoretical foundation casts doubt on the applicability of deep learning to contexts where correct interpretations of the features play a central role. \nIn this work, we investigate the problem of feature selection for analytic deep networks. We prove that for a wide class of networks, including deep feed-forward neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and a major sub-class of residual neural networks, the Adaptive Group Lasso selection procedure with Group Lasso as the base estimator is selection-consistent. The work provides further evidence that Group Lasso might be inefficient for feature selection with neural networks and advocates the use of Adaptive Group Lasso over the popular Group Lasso.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive rank selection, stability guarantees, hardware efficiency, and error bounds, here are some key techniques and implementations that can be considered:\n\n### Dynamic Rank Adjustment Methods\n\n1. **Neuro-Evolution of Low-Rank Adaptation**:\n   The NoRA method described in the paper involves creating a population of low-rank adapters and using neuro-evolution to dynamically adjust and select the best adapters based on their performance on downstream tasks. This approach includes iterative creation, alignment, evaluation, and selection of adapters, which can be seen as a form of dynamic rank adjustment.\n\n2. **Adaptive Rank Selection for Low-Rank Approximation**:\n   The implementation in the repository for adaptive rank selection for low-rank approximation of language models suggests a method where the rank of the approximation can be dynamically adjusted during training. This is done by evaluating the performance of different ranks and selecting the most appropriate one based on the model's performance and computational resources.\n\n### Stability Guarantees\n\n1. **Kernel Methods for Normalization**:\n   Using kernel methods for normalization can help stabilize the model. For instance, techniques like those mentioned in \"Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention\" and \"FLuRKA\" involve using structured matrices and kernel methods to ensure stability and maintain accuracy while reducing memory usage.\n\n2. **Robust Initialization Techniques**:\n   Robust initialization techniques, such as those involving gradient path length control, can help in stabilizing the training process. Ensuring that the initial weights and the adaptation process are well-controlled can prevent the model from diverging or getting stuck in suboptimal solutions.\n\n### Hardware Efficiency\n\n1. **Block-wise Processing**:\n   Implementing block-wise processing, as suggested in the analysis, can significantly improve hardware efficiency. This involves processing the data in blocks rather than as a whole, which can be optimized for hardware to reduce computational overhead.\n\n2. **Structured Matrices**:\n   Using structured matrices that are designed for fast computation, such as those combining fast transforms like FFTs, can enhance hardware efficiency. This approach is highlighted in \"Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations\".\n\n### Error Bounds\n\n1. **Low-Rank + Sparse Decomposition**:\n   Theoretical guarantees and clear error bounds can be established for low-rank + sparse decomposition methods. This is because these methods have well-understood trade-offs between expressivity and efficiency, allowing for the derivation of error bounds based on the rank and sparsity of the matrices involved.\n\n2. **Matrix Differential Equations**:\n   Methods like those described in \"Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\" provide a framework for analyzing and bounding the error in low-rank approximations, which can be crucial for ensuring the accuracy and stability of the model.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that dynamically adjust their rank, ensure stability, are hardware-efficient, and have well-defined error bounds. This approach aligns with the hybrid structure benefits, implementation strategies, and theoretical foundations outlined in the analysis.\n",

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/70 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01652, 2021.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/20 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\nIn 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition $(C V P R)$, pages 770-778, 2016. $\\left[\\mathrm{JGB}^{+}\\right.$21] Andrew Jaegle, Felix Gimeno, Andy Brock, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew Zisserman, and Jo\u00e3o Carreira.

Stability & Generalisation of Gradient Descent for Shallow Neural Networks without the Neural Tangent Kernel\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability control in transformers*\n\n*Dominic Richards, Ilja Kuzborskij*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work revisits on-average algorithmic stability of GD for training overparameterised shallow neural networks and shows oracle type bounds which reveal that the generalisation and excess risk of GD is controlled by an interpolating network with the shortest GD path from initialisation.\n\n**Abstract:** We revisit on-average algorithmic stability of GD for training overparameterised shallow neural networks and prove new generalisation and excess risk bounds without the NTK or PL assumptions. In particular, we show oracle type bounds which reveal that the generalisation and excess risk of GD is controlled by an interpolating network with the shortest GD path from initialisation (in a sense, an interpolating network with the smallest relative norm). While this was known for kernelised interpolants, our proof applies directly to networks trained by GD without intermediate kernelisation. At the same time, by relaxing oracle inequalities developed here we recover existing NTK-based risk bounds in a straightforward way, which demonstrates that our analysis is tighter. Finally, unlike most of the NTK-based analyses we focus on regression with label noise and show that GD with early stopping is consistent.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2.

Extensive use of data augmentation is a promising technique for improving generalization in RL, but it is often found to decrease sample efficiency and can even lead to divergence. In this paper, we investigate causes of instability when using data augmentation in common off-policy RL algorithms. We identify two problems, both rooted in high-variance Q-targets. Based on our findings, we propose a simple yet effective technique for stabilizing this class of algorithms under augmentation. We perform extensive empirical evaluation of image-based RL using both ConvNets and Vision Transformers (ViT) on a family of benchmarks based on DeepMind Control Suite, as well as in robotic manipulation tasks. Our method greatly improves stability and sample efficiency of ConvNets under augmentation, and achieves generalization results competitive with state-of-the-art methods for image-based RL in environments with unseen visuals. We further show that our method scales to RL with ViT-based architectures, and that data augmentation may be especially important in this setting.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 112  (*Influential: 25*)\n\n#### 3.

Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Despite its huge success in practice, the theoretical underpinnings of LoRA have largely remained unexplored. This paper takes the first step to bridge this gap by theoretically analyzing the expressive power of LoRA. We prove that, for fully connected neural networks, LoRA can adapt any model $f$ to accurately represent any smaller target model $\\overline{f}$ if LoRA-rank $\\geq(\\text{width of }f) \\times \\frac{\\text{depth of }\\overline{f}}{\\text{depth of }f}$. We also quantify the approximation error when LoRA-rank is lower than the threshold.

The algorithm uses a training set of input matrices in order to optimize its performance. Specifically, some of the most efficient approximate algorithms for computing low-rank approximations proceed by computing a projection $SA$, where $S$ is a sparse random $m \\times n$ \u201csketching matrix\u201d, and then performing the singular value decomposition of $SA$. We show how to replace the random matrix $S$ with a \u201clearned\u201d matrix of the same sparsity to reduce the error. Our experiments show that, for multiple types of data sets, a learned sketch matrix can substantially reduce the approximation loss compared to a random matrix $S$, sometimes up to one order of magnitude. We also study mixed matrices where only some of the rows are trained and the remaining ones are random, and show that matrices still offer improved performance while retaining worst-case guarantees. Finally, to understand the theoretical aspects of our approach, we study the special case of $m=1$. In particular, we give an approximation algorithm for minimizing the empirical loss, with approximation factor depending on the stable rank of matrices in the training set. We also show generalization bounds for the sketch matrix learning problem.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 57  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 6.

Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8.

Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive rank in neural networks*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 10. Chasing Sparsity in Vision Transformers: An End-to-End Exploration\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity optimization in RetNet architectures*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng, Zhe Gan, Lu Yuan, Lei Zhang, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration of a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs from end to end is carried out, and it is found that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\".\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently received explosive popularity, but their enormous model sizes and training costs remain daunting. Conventional post-training pruning often incurs higher training budgets. In contrast, this paper aims to trim down both the training memory overhead and the inference complexity, without sacrificing the achievable accuracy. We carry out the first-of-its-kind comprehensive exploration, on taking a unified approach of integrating sparsity in ViTs\"from end to end\". Specifically, instead of training full ViTs, we dynamically extract and train sparse subnetworks, while sticking to a fixed small parameter budget. Our approach jointly optimizes model parameters and explores connectivity throughout training, ending up with one sparse network as the final output. The approach is seamlessly extended from unstructured to structured sparsity, the latter by considering to guide the prune-and-grow of self-attention heads inside ViTs. We further co-explore data and architecture sparsity for additional efficiency gains by plugging in a novel learnable token selector to adaptively determine the currently most vital patches. Extensive results on ImageNet with diverse ViT backbones validate the effectiveness of our proposals which obtain significantly reduced computational cost and almost unimpaired generalization. Perhaps most surprisingly, we find that the proposed sparse (co-)training can sometimes improve the ViT accuracy rather than compromising it, making sparsity a tantalizing\"free lunch\". For example, our sparsified DeiT-Small at (5%, 50%) sparsity for (data, architecture), improves 0.28% top-1 accuracy, and meanwhile enjoys 49.32% FLOPs and 4.40% running time savings.

Advancing Model Pruning via Bi-level Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity optimization in RetNet architectures*\n\n*Yihua Zhang, Yuguang Yao, Parikshit Ram, Pu Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Min-Fong Hong, Yanzhi Wang, Sijia Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** BiP can find better winning tickets than IMP in most cases, and is computationally as efficient as the one-shot pruning schemes, demonstrating 2-7 times speedup over IMP for the same level of model accuracy and sparsity.\n\n**Abstract:** The deployment constraints in practical applications necessitate the pruning of large-scale deep learning models, i.e., promoting their weight sparsity. As illustrated by the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH), pruning also has the potential of improving their generalization ability. At the core of LTH, iterative magnitude pruning (IMP) is the predominant pruning method to successfully find 'winning tickets'. Yet, the computation cost of IMP grows prohibitively as the targeted pruning ratio increases. To reduce the computation overhead, various efficient 'one-shot' pruning methods have been developed, but these schemes are usually unable to find winning tickets as good as IMP. This raises the question of how to close the gap between pruning accuracy and pruning efficiency? To tackle it, we pursue the algorithmic advancement of model pruning. Specifically, we formulate the pruning problem from a fresh and novel viewpoint, bi-level optimization (BLO). We show that the BLO interpretation provides a technically-grounded optimization base for an efficient implementation of the pruning-retraining learning paradigm used in IMP. We also show that the proposed bi-level optimization-oriented pruning method (termed BiP) is a special class of BLO problems with a bi-linear problem structure. By leveraging such bi-linearity, we theoretically show that BiP can be solved as easily as first-order optimization, thus inheriting the computation efficiency. Through extensive experiments on both structured and unstructured pruning with 5 model architectures and 4 data sets, we demonstrate that BiP can find better winning tickets than IMP in most cases, and is computationally as efficient as the one-shot pruning schemes, demonstrating 2-7 times speedup over IMP for the same level of model accuracy and sparsity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 12. Learning N: M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity optimization in RetNet architectures*\n\n*Aojun Zhou, Yukun Ma, Junnan Zhu, Jianbo Liu, Zhijie Zhang, Kun Yuan, Wenxiu Sun, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper is the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine- grained sparsity and structured coarse-grains sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to compress and accelerate the models on resource-constrained environments. It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and decent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2\u00d7 speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network\u2019s topology change during the training process. Finally, We justify SR-STE\u2019s advantages with SAD and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-STE by performing comprehensive experiments on various tasks.

Group Invariance, Stability to Deformations, and Complexity of Deep Convolutional Representations\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability control in transformers*\n\n*Alberto Bietti, Julien Mairal*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of deep convolutional architectures is often attributed in part\nto their ability to learn multiscale and invariant representations of natural\nsignals. However, a precise study of these properties and how they affect\nlearning guarantees is still missing. In this paper, we consider deep\nconvolutional representations of signals; we study their invariance to\ntranslations and to more general groups of transformations, their stability to\nthe action of diffeomorphisms, and their ability to preserve signal\ninformation. This analysis is carried by introducing a multilayer kernel based\non convolutional kernel networks and by studying the geometry induced by the\nkernel mapping. We then characterize the corresponding reproducing kernel\nHilbert space (RKHS), showing that it contains a large class of convolutional\nneural networks with homogeneous activation functions. This analysis allows us\nto separate data representation from learning, and to provide a canonical\nmeasure of model complexity, the RKHS norm, which controls both stability and\ngeneralization of any learned model. In addition to models in the constructed\nRKHS, our stability analysis also applies to convolutional networks with\ngeneric activations such as rectified linear units, and we discuss its\nrelationship with recent generalization bounds based on spectral norms.\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mixed precision HODLR matrices\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical error bounds for adaptive low-rank approximations*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the science and engineering community as exploiting data-sparse structures can significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. One particularly popular option within this class is the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal Low-Rank (HODLR) format. In this paper, we show that the off-diagonal blocks of HODLR matrices that are approximated by low-rank matrices can be represented in low precision without degenerating the quality of the overall approximation (with the error growth bounded by a factor of $2$). We also present an adaptive-precision scheme for constructing and storing HODLR matrices, and we prove that the use of mixed precision does not compromise the numerical stability of the resulting HOLDR matrix--vector product and LU factorization. That is, the resulting error in these computations is not significantly greater than the case where we use one precision (say, double) for constructing and storing the HODLR matrix. Our analyses further give insight on how one must choose the working precision in HODLR matrix computations relative to the approximation error in order to not observe the effects of finite precision. Intuitively, when a HOLDR matrix is subject to a high degree of approximation error, subsequent computations can be performed in a lower precision without detriment. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through a range of numerical experiments.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical error bounds for adaptive low-rank approximations*\n\n*Mert Pilanci, Andrea J. Goldsmith, Varun Srivastava, Naomi Sagan, Rajarshi Saha*\n\n**Abstract:** The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\\mathbf{W} \\approx \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\\min_{\\mathbf{Q},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{R}}\\lVert(\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{W})\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\rVert_{\\rm F}^2$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{L}, \\mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter.

X-LoRA: Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts, a Flexible Framework for Large Language Models with Applications in Protein Mechanics and Molecular Design\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptive rank in neural networks*\n\n*Markus J. Buehler, Eric L. Buehler*\n\n**Abstract:** We report a mixture of expert strategy to create fine-tuned large language models using a deep layer-wise token-level approach based on low-rank adaptation (LoRA). Starting with a set of pre-trained LoRA adapters, our gating strategy uses the hidden states to dynamically mix adapted layers, allowing the resulting X-LoRA model to draw upon different capabilities and create never-before-used deep layer-wise combinations to solve tasks. The design is inspired by the biological principles of universality and diversity, where neural network building blocks are reused in different hierarchical manifestations. Hence, the X-LoRA model can be easily implemented for any existing large language model (LLM) without a need for modifications of the underlying structure. We develop a tailored X-LoRA model that offers scientific capabilities including forward/inverse analysis tasks and enhanced reasoning capability, focused on biomaterial analysis, protein mechanics and design. The impact of this work include access to readily expandable and adaptable models with strong domain knowledge and the capability to integrate across areas of knowledge. Featuring experts in biology, mathematics, reasoning, bio-inspired materials, mechanics and materials, chemistry, protein biophysics, mechanics and quantum-mechanics based molecular properties, we conduct a series of physics-focused case studies. We examine knowledge recall, protein mechanics forward/inverse tasks, protein design, adversarial agentic modeling including ontological knowledge graph construction, as well as molecular design. The model is capable not only of making quantitative predictions of nanomechanical properties of proteins or quantum mechanical molecular properties, but also reasons over the results and correctly predicts likely mechanisms that explain distinct molecular behaviors.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive LM block, such as the proposed **AdaptiveRankRetNet**, here are the key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Theoretical Foundations and Error Bounds\n\n- **Kernel-Based Stability Control:**\n  - The researcher needs to develop or find theoretical analyses that provide error bounds and stability guarantees for kernel-based stability control in transformer architectures.

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022. Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. FLuRKA: Fast and accurate unified Low-Rank&Kernel Attention (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Ahan Gupta, Hao Guo, Yueming Yuan, Yan-Quan Zhou, Charith Mendis*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work theoretically and empirically evaluates the speed and quality of FLuRKA, a new class of transformers that achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n**Abstract:** Many efficient $\\textit{approximate}$ self-attention techniques have become prevalent since the inception of the transformer architecture. Two popular classes of these techniques are low-rank and kernel methods. Each of these methods has its strengths. We observe these strengths synergistically complement each other and exploit them to fuse low-rank and kernel methods, producing a new class of transformers: FLuRKA ($\\textbf{F}$ast $\\textbf{L}$ow-$\\textbf{R}$ank&$\\textbf{K}$ernel$ \\textbf{A}$ttention). FLuRKA are highly $\\textit{training-efficient}$ with faster model speeds $\\textit{and}$ similar model qualities compared to constituent low-rank and kernel methods. We theoretically and empirically evaluate the speed and quality of FLuRKA. Our model speed analysis posits a variety of parameter configurations where FLuRKA exhibit speedups over low-rank and kernel approximations and our model quality analysis bounds the error of FLuRKA with respect to full-attention. Empirically, we instantiate three FLuRKA variants which experience speedups of up to 3.3x and 1.7x over low-rank and kernel methods respectively. This translates to speedups of up to 20x over models with flash-attention. Across a diverse set of tasks spanning language modeling, language understanding, long sequence modeling, machine translation, and image classification, FLuRKA achieve comparable accuracy with underlying low-rank and kernel approximations, occasionally surpassing both.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/83 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nMoreover on language modeling (on wikitext-103 Merity et al. [2016]), language understanding (on GLUE Wang et al. 2018]), long sequence modeling (on LRA Tay et al. 2020c|), machine translation (on\nenglish to german and english to french) and image classification (on imagenet Russakovsky et al. [2015]), FLuRKA are competitive with, and occasionally surpass, the low-rank and kernel methods that compose them. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\nThe backbone of the transformer is multi-head-self-attention (MHSA) Vaswani et al. 2017. MHSA computes the following matrix: Concat $\\left(\\operatorname{Head}_{1}\\right.$, Head $_{2}, \\ldots$, Head $\\left._{h}\\right)$ where $\\mathrm{Head}_{i}$ is:\n\n$$\n\\underbrace{\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}\\right)}_{A_{i}} V W_{i}^{V}\n$$\n\nThe matrices $Q, K \\& V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{m}}$ are the input matrices consisting of $N$ points embedded in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{m}}$, where $d_{m}$ and $N$ are known as the embedding dimension and sequence length respectively. $W_{i}^{Q}$, $W_{i}^{K}$ and $W_{i}^{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{m} \\times d_{h}}$ are linear transformations. The matrix $A_{i}$ is known as the attention matrix and the softmax is taken row-wise in the product $Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}$. Self-attention is expensive due to the matrix $A_{i}$ being of size $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$. ### 2.1 Efficient Approximations\n\nLow-rank Methods Low-rank methods exploit the observation that the matrix $A_{i}$ is of low-rank. Motivated by this, linformer [Wang et al., 2020], a SOTA low-rank technique, constructs a low-rank approximation of $\\mathrm{Head}_{i}$ via:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(Q W_{i}^{Q}\\left(E_{1} K W_{i}^{K}\\right)^{T}\\right) E_{2} V W_{i}^{V}\n$$\n\nWhere $E_{1}$ and $E_{2}$ are matrices in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{k} \\times N}$ whose entries are sampled from $N\\left(0, \\frac{1}{d_{k}}\\right)$.\n```\n\n#### 3. Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 93  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, Scatterbrain is proposed, a novel way to unify sparse and low-rank attention for accurate and efficient approximation and is unbiased with provably low error.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity or low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and memory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.11986, 2021.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. DoRA: Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Rank Distribution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Yulong Mao, Kaiyu Huang, Changhao Guan, Ganglin Bao, Fengran Mo, Jinan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive task. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs substantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application of downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the differential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce the Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA and full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the same storage parameter budget.

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated commendable performance as a popular and representative method. However, it is implemented with a fixed intrinsic rank that might not be the ideal setting for the downstream tasks. Recognizing the need for more flexible downstream task adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call allocating low-rank adaptation (ALoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. First, we propose a novel method, AB-LoRA, that can effectively estimate the importance score of each LoRA rank. Second, guided by AB-LoRA, we gradually prune abundant and negatively impacting LoRA ranks and allocate the pruned LoRA budgets to important Transformer modules needing higher ranks. We have conducted experiments on various tasks, and the experimental results demonstrate that our ALoRA method can outperform the recent baselines with comparable tunable parameters.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Rank Selections for Low-Rank Approximation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Shangqian Gao, Ting Hua, Yen-Chang Hsu, Yilin Shen, Hongxia Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework that achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants and retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Abstract:** Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or its weighted variants has significantly progressed in compressing language models. Previous works assume the same importance for all operations and assign the same number of ranks for different layers in a language model. However, such a uniform rank selection is sub-optimal since different operations (layers) have non-uniform demand in capacity. In other words, a desired SVD strategy should allocate more ranks for important operations and vice versa. However, a globally-optimized selection of ranks for neural networks is still an open problem, and this is a non-trivial challenge since the selection is discrete. In this work, we propose a novel binary masking mechanism for optimizing the number of ranks in a differentiable framework. Our strategy uses a novel regularization to enable the masking to comply with the SVD property where the ranks have sorted singular values. The experiments examined both types of language models, encoder-only and decoder-only models, including large language models like LLaMA. Our compressed model achieves much better accuracy than previous SVD and their SOTA variants. More interestingly, our method retains significantly better accuracy with zero or limited fine-tuning, proving the substantial advantage of adaptive rank selection.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. NysADMM: faster composite convex optimization via low-rank approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Shipu Zhao, Zachary Frangella, Madeleine Udell*\n\n**TL;DR:** The breadth of problems on which NysADMM beats standard solvers is a surprise and suggests that ADMM is a dominant paradigm for numerical optimization across a wide range of statistical learning problems that are usually solved with bespoke methods.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper develops a scalable new algorithm, called NysADMM, to minimize a smooth convex loss function with a convex regularizer. NysADMM accelerates the inexact Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) by constructing a preconditioner for the ADMM subproblem from a randomized low-rank Nystr\u00a8om approximation. NysADMM comes with strong theoretical guarantees: it solves the ADMM subproblem in a constant number of iterations when the rank of the Nystr \u00a8 om approximation is the effective dimension of the subproblem regularized Gram matrix. In practice, ranks much smaller than the effective dimension can succeed, so NysADMM uses an adaptive strategy to choose the rank that enjoys analogous guarantees. Numerical experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that NysADMM can solve important applications, such as the lasso, logistic regression, and support vector machines, in half the time (or less) required by standard solvers. The breadth of problems on which NysADMM beats standard solvers is a surprise: it suggests that ADMM is a dominant paradigm for numerical optimization across a wide range of statistical learning problems that are usually solved with bespoke methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Block Low-Rank Preconditioner with Shared Basis for Stochastic Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Jui-Nan Yen, Sai Surya Duvvuri, Inderjit S. Dhillon, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer within each layer, and designs an algorithm to maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive methods with non-diagonal preconditioning have shown state-of-the-art results on various tasks. However, their computational complexity and memory requirement make it challenging to scale these methods to modern neural network architectures. To address this challenge, some previous works have adopted block-diagonal preconditioners. However, the memory cost of storing the block-diagonal matrix remains substantial, leading to the use of smaller block sizes that ultimately leads to suboptimal performance. To reduce the time and memory complexity without sacri\ufb01cing performance, we propose approximating the diagonal blocks of the second moment matrix by low-rank matrices and enforcing the same basis for the blocks within each layer. We provide theoretical justi\ufb01cation for such basis sharing and design an algorithm to ef\ufb01ciently maintain this shared-basis block low-rank approximation during training. Our results on a deep autoencoder and a Transformer benchmark demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms \ufb01rst-order methods with slightly more time and memory usage, while also achieving competitive or superior performance compared to other second-order methods with less time and memory usage.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Learning N: M Fine-grained Structured Sparse Neural Networks From Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity neural networks*\n\n*Aojun Zhou, Yukun Ma, Junnan Zhu, Jianbo Liu, Zhijie Zhang, Kun Yuan, Wenxiu Sun, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper is the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine- grained sparsity and structured coarse-grains sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has been widely studied to compress and accelerate the models on resource-constrained environments. It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and decent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2\u00d7 speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network\u2019s topology change during the training process. Finally, We justify SR-STE\u2019s advantages with SAD and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-STE by performing comprehensive experiments on various tasks.

Training Structured Neural Networks Through Manifold Identification and Variance Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity neural networks*\n\n*Zih-Syuan Huang, Ching-pei Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation and dropout that complicate the training process.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes an algorithm (RMDA) for training neural networks (NNs) with a regularization term for promoting desired structures. RMDA does not incur computation additional to proximal SGD with momentum, and achieves variance reduction without requiring the objective function to be of the finite-sum form. Through the tool of manifold identification from nonlinear optimization, we prove that after a finite number of iterations, all iterates of RMDA possess a desired structure identical to that induced by the regularizer at the stationary point of asymptotic convergence, even in the presence of engineering tricks like data augmentation and dropout that complicate the training process. Experiments on training NNs with structured sparsity confirm that variance reduction is necessary for such an identification, and show that RMDA thus significantly outperforms existing methods for this task. For unstructured sparsity, RMDA also outperforms a state-of-the-art pruning method, validating the benefits of training structured NNs through regularization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Dynamic Low-Rank Instance Adaptation for Universal Neural Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Wei Yang, Xiao Han, Wenming Yang, Jun Zhang, Jinxi Xiang, Yue Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** The latest advancements in neural image compression show great potential in surpassing the rate-distortion performance of conventional standard codecs. Nevertheless, there exists an indelible domain gap between the datasets utilized for training (i.e., natural images) and those utilized for inference (e.g., artistic images). Our proposal involves a low-rank adaptation approach aimed at addressing the rate-distortion drop observed in out-of-domain datasets. Specifically, we perform low-rank matrix decomposition to update certain adaptation parameters of the client's decoder. These updated parameters, along with image latents, are encoded into a bitstream and transmitted to the decoder in practical scenarios. Due to the low-rank constraint imposed on the adaptation parameters, the resulting bit rate overhead is small. Furthermore, the bit rate allocation of low-rank adaptation is \\emph{non-trivial}, considering the diverse inputs require varying adaptation bitstreams. We thus introduce a dynamic gating network on top of the low-rank adaptation method, in order to decide which decoder layer should employ adaptation. The dynamic adaptation network is optimized end-to-end using rate-distortion loss. Our proposed method exhibits universality across diverse image datasets. Extensive results demonstrate that this paradigm significantly mitigates the domain gap, surpassing non-adaptive methods with an average BD-rate improvement of approximately $19\\%$ across out-of-domain images. Furthermore, it outperforms the most advanced instance adaptive methods by roughly $5\\%$ BD-rate. Ablation studies confirm our method's ability to universally enhance various image compression architectures.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-15\n\n\n\n#### 3. LoRA-GA: Low-Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Jian Li, Linxi Yu, Shaowen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pretrained models is prohibitively expensive in terms of computational and memory costs. LoRA, as one of the most popular Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, offers a cost-effective alternative by fine-tuning an auxiliary low-rank model that has significantly fewer parameters. Although LoRA reduces the computational and memory requirements significantly at each iteration, extensive empirical evidence indicates that it converges at a considerably slower rate compared to full fine-tuning, ultimately leading to increased overall compute and often worse test performance. In our paper, we perform an in-depth investigation of the initialization method of LoRA and show that careful initialization (without any change of the architecture and the training algorithm) can significantly enhance both efficiency and performance. In particular, we introduce a novel initialization method, LoRA-GA (Low Rank Adaptation with Gradient Approximation), which aligns the gradients of low-rank matrix product with those of full fine-tuning at the first step. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that LoRA-GA achieves a convergence rate comparable to that of full fine-tuning (hence being significantly faster than vanilla LoRA as well as various recent improvements) while simultaneously attaining comparable or even better performance. For example, on the subset of the GLUE dataset with T5-Base, LoRA-GA outperforms LoRA by 5.69% on average. On larger models such as Llama 2-7B, LoRA-GA shows performance improvements of 0.34, 11.52%, and 5.05% on MT-bench, GSM8K, and Human-eval, respectively. Additionally, we observe up to 2-4 times convergence speed improvement compared to vanilla LoRA, validating its effectiveness in accelerating convergence and enhancing model performance.

H2OPUS-TLR: High Performance Tile Low Rank Symmetric Factorizations using Adaptive Randomized Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Tile low rank representations of dense matrices partition them into blocks of roughly uniform size, where each off-diagonal tile is compressed and stored as its own low rank factorization. They offer an attractive representation for many data-sparse dense operators that appear in practical applications, where substantial compression and a much smaller memory footprint can be achieved. TLR matrices are a compromise between the simplicity of a regular perfectly-strided data structure and the optimal complexity of the unbalanced trees of hierarchically low rank matrices, and provide a convenient performance-tuning parameter through their tile size that can be proportioned to take into account the cache size where the tiles reside in the memory hierarchy. There are currently no high-performance algorithms that can generate Cholesky and $LDL^T$ factorizations, particularly on GPUs. The difficulties in achieving high performance when factoring TLR matrices come from the expensive compression operations that must be performed during the factorization process and the adaptive rank distribution of the tiles that causes an irregular work pattern for the processing cores. In this work, we develop a dynamic batching operation and combine it with batched adaptive randomized approximations to achieve high performance both on GPUs and CPUs. Our implementation attains over 1.2 TFLOP/s in double precision on the V100 GPU, and is limited by the performance of batched GEMM operations. The Cholesky factorization of covariance matrix of size $N = 131K$ arising in spatial statistics can be factored to an accuracy $\\epsilon=10^{-2}$ in just a few seconds. We believe the proposed GEMM-centric algorithm allows it to be readily ported to newer hardware such as the tensor cores that are optimized for small GEMM operations.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Learning Structured Sparsity in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity neural networks*\n\n*Yiran Chen, Chunpeng Wu, Yandan Wang, Wei Wen, Hai Li*\n\n**Abstract:** High demand for computation resources severely hinders deployment of\nlarge-scale Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in resource constrained devices. In this\nwork, we propose a Structured Sparsity Learning (SSL) method to regularize the\nstructures (i.e., filters, channels, filter shapes, and layer depth) of DNNs.\nSSL can: (1) learn a compact structure from a bigger DNN to reduce computation\ncost; (2) obtain a hardware-friendly structured sparsity of DNN to efficiently\naccelerate the DNNs evaluation. Experimental results show that SSL achieves on\naverage 5.1x and 3.1x speedups of convolutional layer computation of AlexNet\nagainst CPU and GPU, respectively, with off-the-shelf libraries. These speedups\nare about twice speedups of non-structured sparsity; (3) regularize the DNN\nstructure to improve classification accuracy. The results show that for\nCIFAR-10, regularization on layer depth can reduce 20 layers of a Deep Residual\nNetwork (ResNet) to 18 layers while improve the accuracy from 91.25% to 92.60%,\nwhich is still slightly higher than that of original ResNet with 32 layers.

Attention-Based Guided Structured Sparsity of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity neural networks*\n\n*Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Sobhan Soleymani, Rouzbeh A.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/70 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01652, 2021.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/20 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nIn 2016 IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition $(C V P R)$, pages 770-778, 2016. $\\left[\\mathrm{JGB}^{+}\\right.$21] Andrew Jaegle, Felix Gimeno, Andy Brock, Oriol Vinyals, Andrew Zisserman, and Jo\u00e3o Carreira.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Motivated by the success of Transformers, we study the covariance matrix of a modified Softmax-based attention model with skip connections in the proportional limit of infinite-depth-and-width. We show that at initialization the limiting distribution can be described by a stochastic differential equation (SDE) indexed by the depth-to-width ratio. To achieve a well-defined stochastic limit, the Transformer's attention mechanism is modified by centering the Softmax output at identity, and scaling the Softmax logits by a width-dependent temperature parameter. We examine the stability of the network through the corresponding SDE, showing how the scale of both the drift and diffusion can be elegantly controlled with the aid of residual connections. The existence of a stable SDE implies that the covariance structure is well-behaved, even for very large depth and width, thus preventing the notorious issues of rank degeneracy in deep attention models. Finally, we show, through simulations, that the SDE provides a surprisingly good description of the corresponding finite-size model. We coin the name shaped Transformer for these architectural modifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field.

Although the causes of such instabilities are of scientific interest, the amount of resources required to reproduce them has made investigation difficult. In this work, we seek ways to reproduce and study training stability and instability at smaller scales. First, we focus on two sources of training instability described in previous work: the growth of logits in attention layers (Dehghani et al., 2023) and divergence of the output logits from the log probabilities (Chowdhery et al., 2022). By measuring the relationship between learning rate and loss across scales, we show that these instabilities also appear in small models when training at high learning rates, and that mitigations previously employed at large scales are equally effective in this regime. This prompts us to investigate the extent to which other known optimizer and model interventions influence the sensitivity of the final loss to changes in the learning rate. To this end, we study methods such as warm-up, weight decay, and the $\\mu$Param (Yang et al., 2022), and combine techniques to train small models that achieve similar losses across orders of magnitude of learning rate variation. Finally, to conclude our exploration we study two cases where instabilities can be predicted before they emerge by examining the scaling behavior of model activation and gradient norms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 47  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4.

Despite its huge success in practice, the theoretical underpinnings of LoRA have largely remained unexplored. This paper takes the first step to bridge this gap by theoretically analyzing the expressive power of LoRA. We prove that, for fully connected neural networks, LoRA can adapt any model $f$ to accurately represent any smaller target model $\\overline{f}$ if LoRA-rank $\\geq(\\text{width of }f) \\times \\frac{\\text{depth of }\\overline{f}}{\\text{depth of }f}$.

The algorithm uses a training set of input matrices in order to optimize its performance. Specifically, some of the most efficient approximate algorithms for computing low-rank approximations proceed by computing a projection $SA$, where $S$ is a sparse random $m \\times n$ \u201csketching matrix\u201d, and then performing the singular value decomposition of $SA$. We show how to replace the random matrix $S$ with a \u201clearned\u201d matrix of the same sparsity to reduce the error. Our experiments show that, for multiple types of data sets, a learned sketch matrix can substantially reduce the approximation loss compared to a random matrix $S$, sometimes up to one order of magnitude. We also study mixed matrices where only some of the rows are trained and the remaining ones are random, and show that matrices still offer improved performance while retaining worst-case guarantees. Finally, to understand the theoretical aspects of our approach, we study the special case of $m=1$.

ZITS++: Image Inpainting by Improving the Incremental Transformer on Structural Priors\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability in transformer models*\n\n*Yanwei Fu, Qiaole Dong, Chenjie Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Image inpainting involves filling missing areas of a corrupted image. Despite impressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both vivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge. Previous methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an improved model upon our conference work, ZITS. Specifically, given one corrupt image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To recover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) module, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention convolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized with the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular masks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting ability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore the effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to utilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive experiments. This investigation is orthogonal to most inpainting approaches and can thus significantly benefit the community. Codes and models will be released in https://github.com/ewrfcas/ZITS-PlusPlus.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Bayesian Force Fields from Active Learning for Simulation of Inter-Dimensional Transformation of Stanene\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability in transformer models*\n\n*Boris Kozinsky, Yu Xie, Lixin Sun, Andrea Cepellotti, Jonathan Vandermause*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a way to dramatically accelerate Gaussian process models for interatomic force fields based on many-body kernels by mapping both forces and uncertainties onto functions of low-dimensional features. This allows for automated active learning of models combining near-quantum accuracy, built-in uncertainty, and constant cost of evaluation that is comparable to classical analytical models, capable of simulating millions of atoms. Using this approach, we perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the stability of the stanene monolayer. We discover an unusual phase transformation mechanism of 2D stanene, where ripples lead to nucleation of bilayer defects, densification into a disordered multilayer structure, followed by formation of bulk liquid at high temperature or nucleation and growth of the 3D bcc crystal at low temperature. The presented method opens possibilities for rapid development of fast accurate uncertainty-aware models for simulating long-time large-scale dynamics of complex materials.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mixed precision HODLR matrices\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical error bounds for adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical matrix computations have attracted significant attention in the science and engineering community as exploiting data-sparse structures can significantly reduce the computational complexity of many important kernels. One particularly popular option within this class is the Hierarchical Off-Diagonal Low-Rank (HODLR) format. In this paper, we show that the off-diagonal blocks of HODLR matrices that are approximated by low-rank matrices can be represented in low precision without degenerating the quality of the overall approximation (with the error growth bounded by a factor of $2$). We also present an adaptive-precision scheme for constructing and storing HODLR matrices, and we prove that the use of mixed precision does not compromise the numerical stability of the resulting HOLDR matrix--vector product and LU factorization. That is, the resulting error in these computations is not significantly greater than the case where we use one precision (say, double) for constructing and storing the HODLR matrix. Our analyses further give insight on how one must choose the working precision in HODLR matrix computations relative to the approximation error in order to not observe the effects of finite precision. Intuitively, when a HOLDR matrix is subject to a high degree of approximation error, subsequent computations can be performed in a lower precision without detriment. We demonstrate the validity of our theoretical results through a range of numerical experiments.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical error bounds for adaptive low-rank approximation*\n\n*Mert Pilanci, Andrea J. Goldsmith, Varun Srivastava, Naomi Sagan, Rajarshi Saha*\n\n**Abstract:** The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\\mathbf{W} \\approx \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\\min_{\\mathbf{Q},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{R}}\\lVert(\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{W})\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\rVert_{\\rm F}^2$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{L}, \\mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg.

It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/70 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2109.01652, 2021.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

Boost Transformer-based Language Models with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: structured sparsity hardware acceleration NLP*\n\n*Chong Yu, Tao Chen, Zhongxue Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Along with the performance improvement in NLP domain, the sizes of transformer-based language models ( TLM ) are also dramatically increased. Some prior works intend to compress TLM models into more compact forms, but do not fully consider the hardware characters may not support the efficient execution for these forms, leading to the deployment of TLM on hardware with noticeable acceleration is still challenging. This paper thoroughly designs a compression scheme named GPUSQ-TLM to maximally utilize the GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization characters . Especially, a dense TLM model is first pruned to meet the GPU\u2019s acceleration constraint of sparse patterns with FP16 type, then it is further quantized into a fixed-point one by quantization-aware training, to provide an extra speedup for integer tensors on GPU. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation of labels, logits and feature maps is used for best accuracy compensation during pruning and quantization process. Experiment results show GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-TLM can boost actual deployment performance by up to 4.08-4.25 \u00d7 times latency and 6.18-6.79 \u00d7 throughput on A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse DST method, Structured RigL (SRigL), to learn a variant of fine-grained structured N:M sparsity by imposing a constant fan-in constraint. Using our empirical analysis of existing DST methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables SRigL to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured DST performance on a variety of Neural Network (NN) architectures. Using a 90% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4x/2.5x on CPU for online inference and 1.7x/13.0x on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

It can be generally categorized into unstructured fine-grained sparsity that zeroes out multiple individual weights distributed across the neural network, and structured coarse-grained sparsity which prunes blocks of sub-networks of a neural network. Fine-grained sparsity can achieve a high compression ratio but is not hardware friendly and hence receives limited speed gains. On the other hand, coarse-grained sparsity cannot simultaneously achieve both apparent acceleration on modern GPUs and decent performance. In this paper, we are the first to study training from scratch an N:M fine-grained structured sparse network, which can maintain the advantages of both unstructured fine-grained sparsity and structured coarse-grained sparsity simultaneously on specifically designed GPUs. Specifically, a 2 : 4 sparse network could achieve 2\u00d7 speed-up without performance drop on Nvidia A100 GPUs. Furthermore, we propose a novel and effective ingredient, sparse-refined straight-through estimator (SR-STE), to alleviate the negative influence of the approximated gradients computed by vanilla STE during optimization. We also define a metric, Sparse Architecture Divergence (SAD), to measure the sparse network\u2019s topology change during the training process. Finally, We justify SR-STE\u2019s advantages with SAD and demonstrate the effectiveness of SR-STE by performing comprehensive experiments on various tasks.

Combining Explicit and Implicit Regularization for Efficient Learning in Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive rank implementation in deep learning*\n\n*Dan Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an explicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with certain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam) and suggests that explicit regularization can play a role in designing different, desirable forms of regularization and that a more nuanced understanding of this interplay may be necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Works on implicit regularization have studied gradient trajectories during the optimization process to explain why deep networks favor certain kinds of solutions over others. In deep linear networks, it has been shown that gradient descent implicitly regularizes toward low-rank solutions on matrix completion/factorization tasks. Adding depth not only improves performance on these tasks but also acts as an accelerative pre-conditioning that further enhances this bias towards low-rankedness. Inspired by this, we propose an explicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with certain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam). This combination can enable a degenerate single-layer network to achieve low-rank approximations with generalization error comparable to deep linear networks, making depth no longer necessary for learning. The single-layer network also performs competitively or out-performs various approaches for matrix completion over a range of parameter and data regimes despite its simplicity. Together with an optimizer's inductive bias, our findings suggest that explicit regularization can play a role in designing different, desirable forms of regularization and that a more nuanced understanding of this interplay may be necessary.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Sun, Rohan Anil, Elad Hazan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank $k$ is presented, which matches full-matrix $d^2$ memory regret using only $dk$ memory up to additive error in the bottom eigenvalues of the gradient covariance.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive regularization methods that exploit more than the diagonal entries exhibit state of the art performance for many tasks, but can be prohibitive in terms of memory and running time. We find the spectra of the Kronecker-factored gradient covariance matrix in deep learning (DL) training tasks are concentrated on a small leading eigenspace that changes throughout training, motivating a low-rank sketching approach. We describe a generic method for reducing memory and compute requirements of maintaining a matrix preconditioner using the Frequent Directions (FD) sketch. While previous approaches have explored applying FD for second-order optimization, we present a novel analysis which allows efficient interpolation between resource requirements and the degradation in regret guarantees with rank $k$: in the online convex optimization (OCO) setting over dimension $d$, we match full-matrix $d^2$ memory regret using only $dk$ memory up to additive error in the bottom $d-k$ eigenvalues of the gradient covariance. Further, we show extensions of our work to Shampoo, resulting in a method competitive in quality with Shampoo and Adam, yet requiring only sub-linear memory for tracking second moments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Provably Efficient Algorithm for Nonstationary Low-Rank MDPs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive rank implementation in deep learning*\n\n*Yuan Cheng, J. Yang, Yitao Liang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a parameter-dependent policy optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and improves PPORTAL to its parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) under changing environment models many real-world applications via nonstationary Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), and hence gains considerable interest. However, theoretical studies on nonstationary MDPs in the literature have mainly focused on tabular and linear (mixture) MDPs, which do not capture the nature of unknown representation in deep RL. In this paper, we make the first effort to investigate nonstationary RL under episodic low-rank MDPs, where both transition kernels and rewards may vary over time, and the low-rank model contains unknown representation in addition to the linear state embedding function. We first propose a parameter-dependent policy optimization algorithm called PORTAL, and further improve PORTAL to its parameter-free version of Ada-PORTAL, which is able to tune its hyper-parameters adaptively without any prior knowledge of nonstationarity. For both algorithms, we provide upper bounds on the average dynamic suboptimality gap, which show that as long as the nonstationarity is not significantly large, PORTAL and Ada-PORTAL are sample-efficient and can achieve arbitrarily small average dynamic suboptimality gap with polynomial sample complexity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. DoRA: Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Rank Distribution\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Yulong Mao, Kaiyu Huang, Changhao Guan, Ganglin Bao, Fengran Mo, Jinan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive task. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs substantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application of downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the differential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce the Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA and full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the same storage parameter budget.

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ZITS++: Image Inpainting by Improving the Incremental Transformer on Structural Priors\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability in transformers*\n\n*Yanwei Fu, Qiaole Dong, Chenjie Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Image inpainting involves filling missing areas of a corrupted image. Despite impressive results have been achieved recently, restoring images with both vivid textures and reasonable structures remains a significant challenge. Previous methods have primarily addressed regular textures while disregarding holistic structures due to the limited receptive fields of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). To this end, we study learning a Zero-initialized residual addition based Incremental Transformer on Structural priors (ZITS++), an improved model upon our conference work, ZITS. Specifically, given one corrupt image, we present the Transformer Structure Restorer (TSR) module to restore holistic structural priors at low image resolution, which are further upsampled by Simple Structure Upsampler (SSU) module to higher image resolution. To recover image texture details, we use the Fourier CNN Texture Restoration (FTR) module, which is strengthened by Fourier and large-kernel attention convolutions. Furthermore, to enhance the FTR, the upsampled structural priors from TSR are further processed by Structure Feature Encoder (SFE) and optimized with the Zero-initialized Residual Addition (ZeroRA) incrementally. Besides, a new masking positional encoding is proposed to encode the large irregular masks. Compared with ZITS, ZITS++ improves the FTR's stability and inpainting ability with several techniques. More importantly, we comprehensively explore the effects of various image priors for inpainting and investigate how to utilize them to address high-resolution image inpainting with extensive experiments. This investigation is orthogonal to most inpainting approaches and can thus significantly benefit the community.

Bayesian Force Fields from Active Learning for Simulation of Inter-Dimensional Transformation of Stanene\n\n*From Search Query: kernel-based stability in transformers*\n\n*Boris Kozinsky, Yu Xie, Lixin Sun, Andrea Cepellotti, Jonathan Vandermause*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a way to dramatically accelerate Gaussian process models for interatomic force fields based on many-body kernels by mapping both forces and uncertainties onto functions of low-dimensional features. This allows for automated active learning of models combining near-quantum accuracy, built-in uncertainty, and constant cost of evaluation that is comparable to classical analytical models, capable of simulating millions of atoms. Using this approach, we perform large scale molecular dynamics simulations of the stability of the stanene monolayer. We discover an unusual phase transformation mechanism of 2D stanene, where ripples lead to nucleation of bilayer defects, densification into a disordered multilayer structure, followed by formation of bulk liquid at high temperature or nucleation and growth of the 3D bcc crystal at low temperature. The presented method opens possibilities for rapid development of fast accurate uncertainty-aware models for simulating long-time large-scale dynamics of complex materials.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Compressing Large Language Models using Low Rank and Low Precision Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: error bounds for adaptive rank approximation in language models*\n\n*Mert Pilanci, Andrea J. Goldsmith, Varun Srivastava, Naomi Sagan, Rajarshi Saha*\n\n**Abstract:** The prohibitive sizes of Large Language Models (LLMs) today make it difficult to deploy them on memory-constrained edge devices. This work introduces $\\rm CALDERA$ -- a new post-training LLM compression algorithm that harnesses the inherent low-rank structure of a weight matrix $\\mathbf{W}$ by approximating it via a low-rank, low-precision decomposition as $\\mathbf{W} \\approx \\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$. Here, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are low rank factors, and the entries of $\\mathbf{Q}$, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are quantized. The model is compressed by substituting each layer with its $\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ decomposition, and the zero-shot performance of the compressed model is evaluated. Additionally, $\\mathbf{L}$ and $\\mathbf{R}$ are readily amenable to low-rank adaptation, consequently enhancing the zero-shot performance. $\\rm CALDERA$ obtains this decomposition by formulating it as an optimization problem $\\min_{\\mathbf{Q},\\mathbf{L},\\mathbf{R}}\\lVert(\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R} - \\mathbf{W})\\mathbf{X}^\\top\\rVert_{\\rm F}^2$, where $\\mathbf{X}$ is the calibration data, and $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{L}, \\mathbf{R}$ are constrained to be representable using low-precision formats. Theoretical upper bounds on the approximation error of $\\rm CALDERA$ are established using a rank-constrained regression framework, and the tradeoff between compression ratio and model performance is studied by analyzing the impact of target rank and quantization bit budget. Results illustrate that compressing LlaMa-$2$ $7$B/$70$B and LlaMa-$3$ $8$B models obtained using $\\rm CALDERA$ outperforms existing post-training LLM compression techniques in the regime of less than $2.5$ bits per parameter.

LoRA-Ensemble: Efficient Uncertainty Modelling for Self-attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive rank implementation in deep learning*\n\n*Mehmet Ozgur Turkoglu, Konrad Schindler, Helge Aasen, Dominik Narnhofer, Alexander Becker, Dominik J. M\u00fchlematter, Michelle Halbheer*\n\n**Abstract:** Numerous crucial tasks in real-world decision-making rely on machine learning algorithms with calibrated uncertainty estimates. However, modern methods often yield overconfident and uncalibrated predictions. Various approaches involve training an ensemble of separate models to quantify the uncertainty related to the model itself, known as epistemic uncertainty. In an explicit implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory requirements. This particular challenge is evident in state-of-the-art neural networks such as transformers, where even a single network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory. Consequently, efforts are made to emulate the ensemble model without actually instantiating separate ensemble members, referred to as implicit ensembling. We introduce LoRA-Ensemble, a parameter-efficient deep ensemble method for self-attention networks, which is based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Initially developed for efficient LLM fine-tuning, we extend LoRA to an implicit ensembling approach. By employing a single pre-trained self-attention network with weights shared across all members, we train member-specific low-rank matrices for the attention projections. Our method exhibits superior calibration compared to explicit ensembles and achieves similar or better accuracy across various prediction tasks and datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 5. Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Francesco Tudisco, Gianluca Ceruti, Jonas Kusch, Emanuele Zangrando, Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-26\n\n\n\n#### 6. Harnessing Orthogonality to Train Low-Rank Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: training stability with dynamic rank adaptation*\n\n*Markus G\u00f6tz, Achim Streit, Charlotte Debus, Nicholas Kiefer, Marie Weiel, Katharina Fl\u00fcgel, Daniel Coquelin*\n\n**Abstract:** This study explores the learning dynamics of neural networks by analyzing the singular value decomposition (SVD) of their weights throughout training. Our investigation reveals that an orthogonal basis within each multidimensional weight's SVD representation stabilizes during training. Building upon this, we introduce Orthogonality-Informed Adaptive Low-Rank (OIALR) training, a novel training method exploiting the intrinsic orthogonality of neural networks. OIALR seamlessly integrates into existing training workflows with minimal accuracy loss, as demonstrated by benchmarking on various datasets and well-established network architectures. With appropriate hyperparameter tuning, OIALR can surpass conventional training setups, including those of state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and evaluating the **AdaptiveRankRetNet** proposal, here are the key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Theoretical Foundations and Stability Guarantees\n\n1. **Kernel-Based Stability Control:**\n   - The researcher needs to delve deeper into theoretical analyses that provide stability guarantees and error bounds for kernel-based methods in transformer architectures.

Problem Analysis\n\nKey challenges to address:\n- Balancing model expressivity with computational efficiency\n- Maintaining stability with dynamic rank adaptation\n- Ensuring hardware-efficient implementation\n- Providing theoretical guarantees for performance\n\n## 3. Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nThe core innovation combines three key components:\n1. Dynamic rank adaptation based on input complexity\n2. Structured sparsity for efficient computation\n3. Kernel-based stability controls\n\n## 4. Design Plan\n\n### 4.1 Adaptive Rank Selection Mechanism\n\n```python\nclass AdaptiveRankUnit(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size, max_rank, min_rank):\n        self.max_rank = max_rank\n        self.min_rank = min_rank\n        self.rank_controller = RankController(hidden_size)\n        \n    def forward(self, x, state):\n        # Determine optimal rank based on input complexity\n        complexity_score = self.rank_controller(x)\n        current_rank = self.compute_adaptive_rank(complexity_score)\n        \n        # Low-rank decomposition with selected rank\n        U, S, V = self.low_rank_decompose(state, current_rank)\n        return torch.matmul(U * S, V.T)\n        \n    def compute_adaptive_rank(self, complexity_score):\n        # Dynamic rank selection with bounds\n        rank = self.min_rank + (self.max_rank - self.min_rank) * complexity_score\n        return max(self.min_rank, min(self.max_rank, int(rank)))\n```\n\n### 4.2 Block-Wise Processing with Structured Sparsity\n\n```python\nclass BlockProcessor(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, block_size, sparsity_ratio):\n        self.block_size = block_size\n        self.sparsity_ratio = sparsity_ratio\n        \n    def forward(self, x, state):\n        # Process in hardware-efficient blocks\n        blocks = x.unfold(1, self.block_size, self.block_size)\n        processed_blocks = []\n        \n        for block in blocks:\n            # Apply structured sparsity\n            mask = self.compute_sparse_mask(block)\n            sparse_block = block * mask\n            \n            # Process with current rank\n            processed_block = self.process_block(sparse_block, state)\n            processed_blocks.append(processed_block)\n            \n        return torch.cat(processed_blocks, dim=1)\n```\n\n### 4.3 Kernel-Based Stability Control\n\n```python\nclass StabilityControl(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, hidden_size):\n        self.kernel_proj = nn.Linear(hidden_size, hidden_size)\n        self.norm_factor = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(1))\n        \n    def forward(self, x, state):\n        # Kernel-based normalization\n        kernel_state = self.kernel_proj(state)\n        norm = torch.norm(kernel_state, dim=-1, keepdim=True)\n        stable_state = kernel_state / (norm + self.norm_factor)\n        \n        return stable_state\n```\n\n### 4.4 Mathematical Formulation\n\nThe adaptive rank selection follows:\n\nR_t = R_min + (R_max - R_min) * \u03c3(f_c(X_t))\n\nwhere f_c is the complexity scoring function and \u03c3 is a sigmoid function.\n\nThe low-rank approximation with stability control:\n\nS_t = K(U_t \u03a3_t V_t^T) / ||K(U_t \u03a3_t V_t^T)||\n\nwhere K is the kernel-based normalization.\n\n## 5. Implementation Guidelines\n\n### 5.1 Rank Selection Implementation\n\n1. Complexity scoring:\n```python\ndef compute_complexity_score(x):\n    # Compute input complexity using gradient statistics\n    grad_stats = torch.var(torch.gradient(x)[0], dim=-1)\n    return torch.sigmoid(grad_stats.mean())\n```\n\n2. Rank bounds selection:\n```python\ndef initialize_rank_bounds(hidden_size):\n    max_rank = min(hidden_size, 256)  # Hardware-aware upper bound\n    min_rank = max(16, hidden_size // 32)  # Minimum expressivity\n    return min_rank, max_rank\n```\n\n### 5.2 Hardware Optimization\n\n1. Block size selection:\n```python\ndef get_optimal_block_size():\n    # Hardware-aware block size selection\n    cache_size = get_gpu_cache_size()\n    return min(256, max(32, cache_size // 4))\n```\n\n2. Memory access optimization:\n```python\ndef optimize_memory_layout(x, block_size):\n    # Optimize tensor layout for hardware\n    return x.view(-1, block_size, x.size(-1)).contiguous()\n```\n\n## 6. Theoretical Analysis\n\n### 6.1 Complexity Analysis\n- Time Complexity: O(n * r(t)) where r(t) is the adaptive rank\n- Space Complexity: O(n * r(t)) for low-rank representations\n- Memory Access: O(b) per block, where b is the block size\n\n### 6.2 Stability Analysis\n- Kernel-based normalization ensures bounded gradients\n- Adaptive rank selection maintains minimum expressivity\n- Block processing reduces numerical error accumulation\n\n### 6.3 Error Bounds\nFor input X and approximation X\u0302:\n||X - X\u0302|| \u2264 \u03b5 * (r_max/r_t)^(1/2)\n\nwhere \u03b5 is the desired error tolerance and r_t is the current rank.\n\n## 7.

The design employs an adaptive rank selection mechanism combined with block-wise processing and kernel-based stability controls, achieving significant memory reduction while preserving model performance. Our approach integrates theoretical guarantees for stability and error bounds, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained environments and long-sequence processing.",
