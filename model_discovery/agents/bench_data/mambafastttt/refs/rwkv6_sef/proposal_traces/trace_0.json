In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/48 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nFigures (2, 3, 3, 8).

Optimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (\"x-formers\") have been introduced to reduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other efficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021). Some recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al., 2019) share similarities with RWKV's chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient, their time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV achieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN. Attention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to scale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing attention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a computationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point where drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense. There has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and its successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work, Poli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the performance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021). Advances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto et al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al., 2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels. While QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as an attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN, RWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable. ## D Time-Mixing Block as an RNN Cell\n\nAs stated in 3.3, the RWKV time-mixing block can be formulated as an RNN, as the $W K V$ computation can be written in such a recursive form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0} & =0 \\\\\nw k v_{t} & =\\frac{a_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}} \\odot v_{t}}{b_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}}} \\\\\na_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot a_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}} \\odot v_{t} \\\\\nb_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot b_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe dataflow of the RNN-like time-mixing is shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/24 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2209.10655, 2022. [36] Eric Martin and Chris Cundy.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling (Avg.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Facing off World Model Backbones: RNNs, Transformers, and S4\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid S4*\n\n*Fei Deng, Junyeong Park, Sungjin Ahn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the effectiveness of Transformers and Structured State Space Sequence models and proposes S4WM, the first S4-based world model that can generate high-dimensional image sequences through latent imagination, and demonstrates that S4 WM outperforms Transformer- based world models in terms of long-term memory, while exhibiting greater efficiency during training and imagination.\n\n**Abstract:** World models are a fundamental component in model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents. To perform temporally extended and consistent simulations of the future in partially observable environments, world models need to possess long-term memory. However, state-of-the-art MBRL agents, such as Dreamer, predominantly employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as their world model backbone, which have limited memory capacity. In this paper, we seek to explore alternative world model backbones for improving long-term memory. In particular, we investigate the effectiveness of Transformers and Structured State Space Sequence (S4) models, motivated by their remarkable ability to capture long-range dependencies in low-dimensional sequences and their complementary strengths. We propose S4WM, the first S4-based world model that can generate high-dimensional image sequences through latent imagination. Furthermore, we extensively compare RNN-, Transformer-, and S4-based world models across four sets of environments, which we have specifically tailored to assess crucial memory capabilities of world models, including long-term imagination, context-dependent recall, reward prediction, and memory-based reasoning. Our findings demonstrate that S4WM outperforms Transformer-based world models in terms of long-term memory, while exhibiting greater efficiency during training and imagination. These results pave the way for the development of stronger MBRL agents.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: State-space models*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State-space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 6. Learning long-range spatial dependencies with horizontal gated-recurrent units\n\n*From Search Query: Gated feedforward*\n\n*Drew Linsley, Junkyung Kim, Vijay Veerabadran, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the horizontal gated-recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections -- both within and across feature columns, and demonstrates that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures which have orders of magnitude more free parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Progress in deep learning has spawned great successes in many engineering applications. As a prime example, convolutional neural networks, a type of feedforward neural networks, are now approaching -- and sometimes even surpassing -- human accuracy on a variety of visual recognition tasks. Here, however, we show that these neural networks and their recent extensions struggle in recognition tasks where co-dependent visual features must be detected over long spatial ranges. We introduce the horizontal gated-recurrent unit (hGRU) to learn intrinsic horizontal connections -- both within and across feature columns. We demonstrate that a single hGRU layer matches or outperforms all tested feedforward hierarchical baselines including state-of-the-art architectures which have orders of magnitude more free parameters. We further discuss the biological plausibility of the hGRU in comparison to anatomical data from the visual cortex as well as human behavioral data on a classic contour detection task.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 144  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 7. From Bayesian Sparsity to Gated Recurrent Nets\n\n*From Search Query: Gated feedforward*\n\n*Hao He, Bo Xin, Satoshi Ikehata, D. Wipf*\n\n**TL;DR:** The parallels between latent variable trajectories operating across multiple time-scales during optimization, and the activations within deep network structures designed to adaptively model such characteristic sequences are examined, leading to a novel sparse estimation system that can estimate optimal solutions efficiently in regimes where other algorithms fail.\n\n**Abstract:** The iterations of many first-order algorithms, when applied to minimizing common regularized regression functions, often resemble neural network layers with pre-specified weights. This observation has prompted the development of learning-based approaches that purport to replace these iterations with enhanced surrogates forged as DNN models from available training data. For example, important NP-hard sparse estimation problems have recently benefitted from this genre of upgrade, with simple feedforward or recurrent networks ousting proximal gradient-based iterations. Analogously, this paper demonstrates that more powerful Bayesian algorithms for promoting sparsity, which rely on complex multi-loop majorization-minimization techniques, mirror the structure of more sophisticated long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, or alternative gated feedback networks previously designed for sequence prediction. As part of this development, we examine the parallels between latent variable trajectories operating across multiple time-scales during optimization, and the activations within deep network structures designed to adaptively model such characteristic sequences. The resulting insights lead to a novel sparse estimation system that, when granted training data, can estimate optimal solutions efficiently in regimes where other algorithms fail, including practical direction-of-arrival (DOA) and 3D geometry recovery problems. The underlying principles we expose are also suggestive of a learning process for a richer class of multi-loop algorithms in other domains.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. Mixture of Attention Heads: Selecting Attention Heads Per Token\n\n*From Search Query: Gated feedforward*\n\n*Xiaofeng Zhang, Yikang Shen, Zeyu Huang, Jie Zhou, Wenge Rong, Zhang Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism, is proposed, which can easily scale up the number of attention heads and theNumber of parameters while preserving computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) networks have been proposed as an efficient way to scale up model capacity and implement conditional computing. However, the study of MoE components mostly focused on the feedforward layer in Transformer architecture. This paper proposes the Mixture of Attention Heads (MoA), a new architecture that combines multi-head attention with the MoE mechanism. MoA includes a set of attention heads that each has its own set of parameters. Given an input, a router dynamically selects a subset of k attention heads per token. This conditional computation schema allows MoA to achieve stronger performance than the standard multi-head attention layer. Furthermore, the sparsely gated MoA can easily scale up the number of attention heads and the number of parameters while preserving computational efficiency. Despite performance improvements, MoA also automatically differentiates heads\u2019 utilities, providing a new perspective to discuss the model\u2019s interpretability.

Small-footprint Highway Deep Neural Networks for Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Gated feedforward*\n\n*Liang Lu, Steve Renals*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art speech recognition systems typically employ neural network\nacoustic models. However, compared to Gaussian mixture models, deep neural\nnetwork (DNN) based acoustic models often have many more model parameters,\nmaking it challenging for them to be deployed on resource-constrained\nplatforms, such as mobile devices. In this paper, we study the application of\nthe recently proposed highway deep neural network (HDNN) for training\nsmall-footprint acoustic models. HDNNs are a depth-gated feedforward neural\nnetwork, which include two types of gate functions to facilitate the\ninformation flow through different layers. Our study demonstrates that HDNNs\nare more compact than regular DNNs for acoustic modeling, i.e., they can\nachieve comparable recognition accuracy with many fewer model parameters.\nFurthermore, HDNNs are more controllable than DNNs: the gate functions of an\nHDNN can control the behavior of the whole network using a very small number of\nmodel parameters. Finally, we show that HDNNs are more adaptable than DNNs. For\nexample, simply updating the gate functions using adaptation data can result in\nconsiderable gains in accuracy. We demonstrate these aspects by experiments\nusing the publicly available AMI corpus, which has around 80 hours of training\ndata.\n\n**Published:** 2016-10-18T22:06:01Z  (*Updated: 2017-04-25T19:48:41Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Previously, we investigated a structured HDNN architecture for speech\nrecognition, in which the two gate functions were tied across all the hidden\nlayers, and we were able to train a much smaller model without sacrificing the\nrecognition accuracy. In this paper, we carry on the study of this architecture\nwith sequence-discriminative training criterion and speaker adaptation\ntechniques on the AMI meeting speech recognition corpus. We show that these two\ntechniques improve speech recognition accuracy on top of the model trained with\nthe cross entropy criterion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two gate\nfunctions that are tied across all the hidden layers are able to control the\ninformation flow over the whole network, and we can achieve considerable\nimprovements by only updating these gate functions in both sequence training\nand adaptation experiments.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-07T11:24:51Z  (*Updated: 2017-03-22T15:59:30Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SiMBA: Simplified Mamba-Based Architecture for Vision and Multivariate Time series\n\n*From Search Query: Liquid S4*\n\n*Vijay S. Agneeswaran, Badri N. Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have widely adopted attention networks for sequence mixing and MLPs for channel mixing, playing a pivotal role in achieving breakthroughs across domains. However, recent literature highlights issues with attention networks, including low inductive bias and quadratic complexity concerning input sequence length. State Space Models (SSMs) like S4 and others (Hippo, Global Convolutions, liquid S4, LRU, Mega, and Mamba), have emerged to address the above issues to help handle longer sequence lengths. Mamba, while being the state-of-the-art SSM, has a stability issue when scaled to large networks for computer vision datasets. We propose SiMBA, a new architecture that introduces Einstein FFT (EinFFT) for channel modeling by specific eigenvalue computations and uses the Mamba block for sequence modeling. Extensive performance studies across image and time-series benchmarks demonstrate that SiMBA outperforms existing SSMs, bridging the performance gap with state-of-the-art transformers. Notably, SiMBA establishes itself as the new state-of-the-art SSM on ImageNet and transfer learning benchmarks such as Stanford Car and Flower as well as task learning benchmarks as well as seven time series benchmark datasets.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: State-space models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: State-space models*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. MossFormer2: Combining Transformer and RNN-Free Recurrent Network for Enhanced Time-Domain Monaural Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: Gated feedforward*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Our previously proposed MossFormer has achieved promising performance in monaural speech separation. However, it predominantly adopts a self-attention-based MossFormer module, which tends to emphasize longer-range, coarser-scale dependencies, with a deficiency in effectively modelling finer-scale recurrent patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model that provides the capabilities to model both long-range, coarse-scale dependencies and fine-scale recurrent patterns by integrating a recurrent module into the MossFormer framework. Instead of applying the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that use traditional recurrent connections, we present a recurrent module based on a feedforward sequential memory network (FSMN), which is considered \"RNN-free\" recurrent network due to the ability to capture recurrent patterns without using recurrent connections. Our recurrent module mainly comprises an enhanced dilated FSMN block by using gated convolutional units (GCU) and dense connections. In addition, a bottleneck layer and an output layer are also added for controlling information flow. The recurrent module relies on linear projections and convolutions for seamless, parallel processing of the entire sequence. The integrated MossFormer2 hybrid model demonstrates remarkable enhancements over MossFormer and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in WSJ0-2/3mix, Libri2Mix, and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks.\n\n**Conference:** mossformer2-combining-transformer-and-rnn\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-19\n\n\n\n#### 5.

This report introduces JetMoE-8B, a new LLM trained with less than $0.1 million, using 1.25T tokens from carefully mixed open-source corpora and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, the JetMoE-8B demonstrates impressive performance, with JetMoE-8B outperforming the Llama2-7B model and JetMoE-8B-Chat surpassing the Llama2-13B-Chat model. These results suggest that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. JetMoE-8B is based on an efficient Sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture, composed of attention and feedforward experts. Both layers are sparsely activated, allowing JetMoE-8B to have 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. Moreover, JetMoE-8B is highly open and academia-friendly, using only public datasets and training code. All training parameters and data mixtures have been detailed in this report to facilitate future efforts in the development of open foundation models.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n(2023); Qin et al. (2024) for large-scale experiments. As a result, HGRN2 can be regarded as an improved parameterization of GLA. We extensively evaluate HGRN2 across various tasks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms HGRN1 in multiple domains. In language modeling, we show HGRN2 to be highly competitive compared to other subquadratic efficient models. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Gated linear RNN\n\nGiven input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, where the sequence length is $N$ and the model dimension is $d$, a minimalist gated linear recurrent layer (Martin \\& Cundy, 2018) transforms the input $\\mathbf{x}$ into hidden states $\\mathbf{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and the output $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, as defined below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{g}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{u}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{i}_{t} & =\\tau\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{v}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{w}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t} & =\\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{t} & =\\mathbf{h}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{o}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes element-wise product; $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\tau$ is a nonlinear activation function (we choose to use SiLU); $\\mathbf{i}_{t}$ is the input vector; $\\mathbf{g}_{t}$ and $\\mathbf{o}_{t}$ are the forget gate and output gate, respectively. The input gate is tied to the forget gate as $1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}$, a common approach used in many gated RNNs such as GRU (Chung et al., 2014). ### 2.2 HGRN Qin et al. 2023c)\n\nCompared to Eq. 1. HGRN makes two adjustments: (i) complex-valued recurrence and (ii) forget gates with monotonically increased lower bound values from bottom layers to upper layers. For (i), similar to the findings in Gu \\& Dao (2023) and De et al. (2024), we empirically found that complex-valued recurrence is not necessary, as shown in Table 1. The reason why HGRN found it useful is due to state expansion: the complex-valued recurrent state is twice the size of that in the real-valued recurrent state. If we directly expand the real-valued recurrent state size from $d$ to $2 d$, the language modeling performance on the Wikitext-103 corpus is even better. Therefore, we only consider the real-valued recurrence thereafter. For (ii), suppose the total number of layers is L. HGRN introduces a data-independent learnable matrix $\\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $\\Gamma_{i}$ represents the lowest values of the forget gate for the $i$-th layer at all time steps. HGRN argues that this lower bound should be monotonically increasing from bottom to top, encouraging the bottom layers to model short-term local dependencies and the upper layers to model long-term dependencies. To enforce this monotonicity, HGRN uses the cumulative softmax operator cumax (Shen et al., 2018):\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\operatorname{cumax}(\\Gamma)=\\operatorname{cumsum}(\\operatorname{softmax}(\\Gamma, \\operatorname{dim}=0), \\operatorname{dim}=0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}, \\quad \\beta^{i}=[\\beta]_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nTable 1: Comparison of real HGRN and complex HGRN. We found that real HGRN with twice the state size performs better than complex HGRN in Wiki103 language modeling. | Method | State size | PPL(val) | PPL(test) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Complex HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.14 | 24.82 | 46.25 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $d$ | 25.34 | 26.12 | 46.24 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.04 | 24.64 | 45.46 |\n\nTo prevent the lower bound from reaching one in the highest layer, HGRN subtracts all $\\beta$ values by $\\beta^{0}$, making the lower bound for the first layer zero. After obtaining the lower bound values, the forget gate $g_{t}$ learns residuals instead, resulting in a new forget gate $f_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} & =\\beta^{i}+\\left(1-\\beta^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t}^{i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{i} & =\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{i}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t}^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the layer index. This additive lower bound approach has been shown to mitigate the issue of saturated gates Gu et al. 2020). ## 3 Method\n\n### 3.1 Explorations of state expansion methods\n\nThe goal of this work is to scale the size of the HGRN recurrent state from $d$ to $n d$, where $n$ is the state expansion ratio. However, if we use the original parameterization in Eq. 1, the matrices $\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{W}$ will have dimensions $d \\times n d$, which becomes very parameter inefficient when $n$ is large. Ideally, the number of parameters should be around $d^{2}$, as in the original case for each projection. To achieve this, we first consider using structured matrices (e.g., low-rank matrices) to replace the dense projection matrix $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n d}$, as described in Table 2 .

We list the Einstein Summation for low-rank (LR), group linear transformation (GLT), group linear transformation with interaction (GLTI), Khatri-Rao product (KRP), and Kronecker product (KP). | Method | Equation | Parameter\\# |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Naive | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{n d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $n d^{2}$ |\n| LR | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r} \\mathbf{n d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d r(n+1) \\approx d^{2}$ |\n| GLT | $d=(n e) \\rightarrow n e$ <br> $n e, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{e d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}$ |\n| GLTI | $d=(n e) \\rightarrow n e$ <br> $n e, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{e d}, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{n} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}+n^{2}$ |\n| KRP | $d, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $n d$ |\n| KP | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{n} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}+n$ |\n\nAfter obtaining the expanded $\\mathbf{g}, \\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{o}$, we feed them into element-wise gated linear recurrent layers as in Eq.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/29 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n| Model | Bn Params | Bn Token | PIQA | Hella. | Wino. | ARC-e | ARC-c | OBQA | AVG |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| OPT | 0.35 | 300 | 64.58 | 36.69 | 52.49 | 44.02 | 23.89 | 28.20 | 41.65 |\n| Pythia | 0.40 | 300 | 67.08 | 40.52 | 53.59 | 51.81 | 24.15 | 29.40 | 44.43 |\n| BLOOM | 0.56 | 350 | 64.09 | 46.97 | 52.80 | 47.35 | 29.38 | 28.20 | 42.23 |\n| RWKV-4 | 0.43 | - | 67.52 | 39.00 | 51.14 | 52.86 | 25.17 | 32.40 | 45.00 |\n| Llama $^{+}$ | 0.4 | 350 | 67.19 | 38.75 | 52.19 | 49.24 | 23.72 | 30.00 | 43.51 |\n| Mamba ${ }^{+}$ | 0.4 | 300 | 67.90 | 40.74 | 52.72 | 53.07 | 24.74 | 31.20 | 45.06 |\n| HGRN2 ${ }^{+}$ | 0.4 | 300 | 67.74 | 40.32 | 51.78 | 54.21 | 24.83 | 31.20 | 45.01 |\n| GPT-Neo | 1.3 | 300 | 71.11 | 48.93 | 54.93 | 56.19 | 25.85 | 33.60 | 48.44 |\n| OPT | 1.3 | 300 | 71.71 | 53.70 | 59.35 | 57.24 | 29.69 | 33.20 | 50.82 |\n| Pythia | 1.4 | 300 | 70.67 | 47.18 | 53.51 | 56.99 | 26.88 | 31.40 | 47.77 |\n| BLOOM | 1.3 | 350 | 71.42 | 49.83 | 51.47 | 55.63 | 29.40 | 44.50 | 47.27 |\n| RWKV-4 | 1.5 | - | 72.36 | 52.48 | 54.62 | 60.48 | 29.44 | 34.00 | 50.56 |\n| Llama $^{+}$ | 1.0 | 300 | 69.97 | 47.04 | 52.72 | 57.07 | 26.18 | 32.60 | 47.93 |\n| Mamba ${ }^{+}$ | 1.0 | 300 | 71.27 | 50.15 | 56.35 | 58.71 | 29.27 | 31.20 | 49.45 |\n| HGRN2 ${ }^{+}$ | 1.0 | 300 | 71.65 | 49.52 | 54.38 | 60.27 | 28.07 | 33.40 | 49.55 |\n| OPT | 2.7 | 300 | 73.83 | 60.60 | 61.01 | 60.77 | 31.31 | 35.20 | 53.79 |\n| Pythia | 2.8 | 300 | 74.10 | 59.31 | 59.91 | 64.14 | 33.02 | 35.60 | 54.35 |\n| BLOOM | 3.0 | 350 | 70.57 | 54.53 | 58.49 | 59.43 | 30.38 | 32.20 | 50.77 |\n| RWKV-4 | 3.0 | - | 72.42 | 58.75 | 57.30 | 62.92 | 35.15 | 36.20 | 53.79 |\n| Llama $^{+}$ | 3.0 | 350 | 73.18 | 57.88 | 59.59 | 63.93 | 33.51 | 35.40 | 53.93 |\n| Mamba ${ }^{+}$ | 3.0 | 300 | 74.92 | 61.68 | 59.19 | 65.33 | 31.45 | 35.60 | 55.31 |\n| HGRN2 ${ }^{+}$ | 3.0 | 300 | 74.10 | 61.48 | 58.64 | 65.61 | 34.47 | 35.60 | 54.98 |\n| Llama ${ }^{+}$ | 7.0 | 300 | 75.19 | 64.39 | 61.88 | 67.55 | 35.41 | 35.00 | 56.57 |\n| $H$ HRN2 ${ }^{\\dagger}$ | 7.0 | 300 | 76.50 | 66.96 | 61.40 | 69.02 | 36.86 | 38.00 | 58.12 |\n\nTable 9: Performance Comparison on SCROLLS.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B). Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, and CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

The input gate is tied to the forget gate as $1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}$, a common approach used in many gated RNNs such as GRU (Chung et al., 2014). ### 2.2 HGRN Qin et al. 2023c)\n\nCompared to Eq. 1. HGRN makes two adjustments: (i) complex-valued recurrence and (ii) forget gates with monotonically increased lower bound values from bottom layers to upper layers. For (i), similar to the findings in Gu \\& Dao (2023) and De et al. (2024), we empirically found that complex-valued recurrence is not necessary, as shown in Table 1. The reason why HGRN found it useful is due to state expansion: the complex-valued recurrent state is twice the size of that in the real-valued recurrent state. If we directly expand the real-valued recurrent state size from $d$ to $2 d$, the language modeling performance on the Wikitext-103 corpus is even better. Therefore, we only consider the real-valued recurrence thereafter. For (ii), suppose the total number of layers is L. HGRN introduces a data-independent learnable matrix $\\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $\\Gamma_{i}$ represents the lowest values of the forget gate for the $i$-th layer at all time steps. HGRN argues that this lower bound should be monotonically increasing from bottom to top, encouraging the bottom layers to model short-term local dependencies and the upper layers to model long-term dependencies. To enforce this monotonicity, HGRN uses the cumulative softmax operator cumax (Shen et al., 2018):\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\operatorname{cumax}(\\Gamma)=\\operatorname{cumsum}(\\operatorname{softmax}(\\Gamma, \\operatorname{dim}=0), \\operatorname{dim}=0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}, \\quad \\beta^{i}=[\\beta]_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nTable 1: Comparison of real HGRN and complex HGRN. We found that real HGRN with twice the state size performs better than complex HGRN in Wiki103 language modeling. | Method | State size | PPL(val) | PPL(test) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Complex HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.14 | 24.82 | 46.25 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $d$ | 25.34 | 26.12 | 46.24 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.04 | 24.64 | 45.46 |\n\nTo prevent the lower bound from reaching one in the highest layer, HGRN subtracts all $\\beta$ values by $\\beta^{0}$, making the lower bound for the first layer zero. After obtaining the lower bound values, the forget gate $g_{t}$ learns residuals instead, resulting in a new forget gate $f_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} & =\\beta^{i}+\\left(1-\\beta^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t}^{i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{i} & =\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{i}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t}^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the layer index. This additive lower bound approach has been shown to mitigate the issue of saturated gates Gu et al. 2020). ## 3 Method\n\n### 3.1 Explorations of state expansion methods\n\nThe goal of this work is to scale the size of the HGRN recurrent state from $d$ to $n d$, where $n$ is the state expansion ratio. However, if we use the original parameterization in Eq. 1, the matrices $\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{W}$ will have dimensions $d \\times n d$, which becomes very parameter inefficient when $n$ is large. Ideally, the number of parameters should be around $d^{2}$, as in the original case for each projection. To achieve this, we first consider using structured matrices (e.g., low-rank matrices) to replace the dense projection matrix $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n d}$, as described in Table 2 .

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved significant empirical success in recent years. However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion \n\n${ }^{1}$ Zhen Qin ${ }^{\\dagger},{ }^{2}$ Songlin Yang ${ }^{\\dagger},{ }^{3}$ Weixuan Sun, ${ }^{3}$ Xuyang Shen, ${ }^{3}$ Dong Li, ${ }^{3}$ Weigao Sun,<br>${ }^{3}$ Yiran Zhong*<br>${ }^{1}$ TapTap ${ }^{2}$ MIT CSAIL ${ }^{3}$ OpenNLPLab, Shanghai AI Lab<br>https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/HGRN2\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nHierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, Qin et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/63 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nSun, and Y. Zhong.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

The proposed method first generates pseudo-documents by few-shot prompting large language models (LLMs), and then expands the query with generated pseudo-documents. LLMs are trained on web-scale text corpora and are adept at knowledge memorization. The pseudo-documents from LLMs often contain highly relevant information that can aid in query disambiguation and guide the retrievers. Experimental results demonstrate that query2doc boosts the performance of BM25 by 3% to 15% on ad-hoc IR datasets, such as MS-MARCO and TREC DL, without any model fine-tuning.

However, most existing methods struggle with large graphs due to the complexity of representing the entire joint distribution across all node pairs and capturing both global and local graph structures simultaneously. To overcome these issues, we introduce a method that generates a graph by progressively expanding a single node to a target graph. In each step, nodes and edges are added in a localized manner through denoising diffusion, building first the global structure, and then refining the local details. The local generation avoids modeling the entire joint distribution over all node pairs, achieving substantial computational savings with subquadratic runtime relative to node count while maintaining high expressivity through multiscale generation. Our experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on well-established benchmark datasets while successfully scaling to graphs with at least 5000 nodes. Our method is also the first to successfully extrapolate to graphs outside of the training distribution, showcasing a much better generalization capability over existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Class-incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable neural networks to learn different categories at multi-stages. Recently, dynamic-structure-based CIL methods achieve remarkable performance. However, these methods train all modules in a coupled manner and do not consider possible conflicts among modules, resulting in spoilage of eventual predictions. In this work, we propose a unifying energy-based theory and framework called Bi-Compatible Energy-Based Expansion and Fusion (BEEF) to analyze and achieve the goal of CIL. We demonstrate the possibility of training independent modules in a decoupled manner while achieving bi-directional compatibility among modules through two additionally allocated prototypes, and then integrating them into a unifying classifier with minimal cost. Furthermore, BEEF extends the exemplar-set to a more challenging setting, where exemplars are randomly selected and imbalanced, and maintains its performance when prior methods fail dramatically. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks: CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and ImageNet-1000 demonstrate that BEEF achieves state-of-the-art performance in both the ordinary and challenging CIL settings.

Among the various fine-tuning methods, adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is undoubtedly one of the most attractive topics, as it only requires fine-tuning a few external parameters instead of the entire LLMs while achieving comparable or even better performance. To enable further research on PEFT methods of LLMs, this paper presents LLM-Adapters, an easy-to-use framework that integrates various adapters into LLMs and can execute these adapter-based PEFT methods of LLMs for different tasks. The framework includes state-of-the-art open-access LLMs such as LLaMA, BLOOM, and GPT-J, as well as widely used adapters such as Series adapters, Parallel adapter, Prompt-based learning and Reparametrization-based methods. Moreover, we conduct extensive empirical studies on the impact of adapter types, placement locations, and hyper-parameters to the best design for each adapter-based methods. We evaluate the effectiveness of the adapters on fourteen datasets from two different reasoning tasks, Arithmetic Reasoning and Commonsense Reasoning.

UniAdapter: Unified Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Cross-modal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-efficient state expansion*\n\n*Haoyu Lu, Mingyu Ding, Yuqi Huo, Guoxing Yang, Zhiwu Lu, M. Tomizuka, Wei Zhan*\n\n**TL;DR:** UniAdapter is proposed, which unifies unimodal and multimodal adapters for parameter-efficient cross-modal adaptation on pre-trained vision-language models and shows that in most cases, UniAdapter not only outperforms the state-of-the-arts, but even beats the full fine-tuning strategy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale vision-language pre-trained models have shown promising transferability to various downstream tasks. As the size of these foundation models and the number of downstream tasks grow, the standard full fine-tuning paradigm becomes unsustainable due to heavy computational and storage costs. This paper proposes UniAdapter, which unifies unimodal and multimodal adapters for parameter-efficient cross-modal adaptation on pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, adapters are distributed to different modalities and their interactions, with the total number of tunable parameters reduced by partial weight sharing. The unified and knowledge-sharing design enables powerful cross-modal representations that can benefit various downstream tasks, requiring only 1.0%-2.0% tunable parameters of the pre-trained model. Extensive experiments on 6 cross-modal downstream benchmarks (including video-text retrieval, image-text retrieval, VideoQA, and VQA) show that in most cases, UniAdapter not only outperforms the state-of-the-arts, but even beats the full fine-tuning strategy. Particularly, on the MSRVTT retrieval task, UniAdapter achieves 49.7% recall@1 with 2.2% model parameters, outperforming the latest competitors by 2.0%.

Learning Delays in Spiking Neural Networks using Dilated Convolutions with Learnable Spacings\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV feedforward integration*\n\n*Ilyass Hammouamri, Ismail Khalfaoui-Hassani, T. Masquelier*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses delays in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner, and demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are a promising research direction for building power-efficient information processing systems, especially for temporal tasks such as speech recognition. In SNNs, delays refer to the time needed for one spike to travel from one neuron to another. These delays matter because they influence the spike arrival times, and it is well-known that spiking neurons respond more strongly to coincident input spikes. More formally, it has been shown theoretically that plastic delays greatly increase the expressivity in SNNs. Yet, efficient algorithms to learn these delays have been lacking. Here, we propose a new discrete-time algorithm that addresses this issue in deep feedforward SNNs using backpropagation, in an offline manner. To simulate delays between consecutive layers, we use 1D convolutions across time. The kernels contain only a few non-zero weights - one per synapse - whose positions correspond to the delays. These positions are learned together with the weights using the recently proposed Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacings (DCLS). We evaluated our method on three datasets: the Spiking Heidelberg Dataset (SHD), the Spiking Speech Commands (SSC) and its non-spiking version Google Speech Commands v0.02 (GSC) benchmarks, which require detecting temporal patterns. We used feedforward SNNs with two or three hidden fully connected layers, and vanilla leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. We showed that fixed random delays help and that learning them helps even more. Furthermore, our method outperformed the state-of-the-art in the three datasets without using recurrent connections and with substantially fewer parameters. Our work demonstrates the potential of delay learning in developing accurate and precise models for temporal data processing.

CRF-CNN: Modeling Structured Information in Human Pose Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV feedforward integration*\n\n*Xiao Chu, Wanli Ouyang, Hongsheng Li, Xiaogang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A CRF-CNN framework is proposed which can simultaneously model structural information in both output and hidden feature layers in a probabilistic way, and it is applied to human pose estimation and a neural network implementation of end-to-end learning CRf-CNN is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved great success. On the other hand, modeling structural information has been proved critical in many vision problems. It is of great interest to integrate them effectively. In a classical neural network, there is no message passing between neurons in the same layer. In this paper, we propose a CRF-CNN framework which can simultaneously model structural information in both output and hidden feature layers in a probabilistic way, and it is applied to human pose estimation. A message passing scheme is proposed, so that in various layers each body joint receives messages from all the others in an efficient way. Such message passing can be implemented with convolution between features maps in the same layer, and it is also integrated with feedforward propagation in neural networks. Finally, a neural network implementation of end-to-end learning CRF-CNN is provided. Its effectiveness is demonstrated through experiments on two benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion\n\n*From Search Query: HGRN2 state expansion*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Songlin Yang, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \\citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

We also\ndescribe efficient ways of applying these mobile models to object detection in\na novel framework we call SSDLite. Additionally, we demonstrate how to build\nmobile semantic segmentation models through a reduced form of DeepLabv3 which\nwe call Mobile DeepLabv3.\n  The MobileNetV2 architecture is based on an inverted residual structure where\nthe input and output of the residual block are thin bottleneck layers opposite\nto traditional residual models which use expanded representations in the input\nan MobileNetV2 uses lightweight depthwise convolutions to filter features in\nthe intermediate expansion layer. Additionally, we find that it is important to\nremove non-linearities in the narrow layers in order to maintain\nrepresentational power. We demonstrate that this improves performance and\nprovide an intuition that led to this design.

X3D: Expanding Architectures for Efficient Video Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-efficient state expansion*\n\n*Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents X3D, a family of efficient video networks that progressively expand a tiny 2D image classification architecture along multiple network axes, in space, time, width and depth. Inspired by feature selection methods in machine learning, a simple stepwise network expansion approach is employed that expands a single axis in each step, such that good accuracy to complexity trade-off is achieved. To expand X3D to a specific target complexity, we perform progressive forward expansion followed by backward contraction. X3D achieves state-of-the-art performance while requiring 4.8x and 5.5x fewer multiply-adds and parameters for similar accuracy as previous work. Our most surprising finding is that networks with high spatiotemporal resolution can perform well, while being extremely light in terms of network width and parameters. We report competitive accuracy at unprecedented efficiency on video classification and detection benchmarks.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

We extensively evaluate HGRN2 across various tasks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms HGRN1 in multiple domains. In language modeling, we show HGRN2 to be highly competitive compared to other subquadratic efficient models. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Gated linear RNN\n\nGiven input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, where the sequence length is $N$ and the model dimension is $d$, a minimalist gated linear recurrent layer (Martin \\& Cundy, 2018) transforms the input $\\mathbf{x}$ into hidden states $\\mathbf{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and the output $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, as defined below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{g}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{u}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{i}_{t} & =\\tau\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{v}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{w}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t} & =\\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{t} & =\\mathbf{h}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{o}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes element-wise product; $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\tau$ is a nonlinear activation function (we choose to use SiLU); $\\mathbf{i}_{t}$ is the input vector; $\\mathbf{g}_{t}$ and $\\mathbf{o}_{t}$ are the forget gate and output gate, respectively. The input gate is tied to the forget gate as $1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}$, a common approach used in many gated RNNs such as GRU (Chung et al., 2014). ### 2.2 HGRN Qin et al. 2023c)\n\nCompared to Eq. 1. HGRN makes two adjustments: (i) complex-valued recurrence and (ii) forget gates with monotonically increased lower bound values from bottom layers to upper layers. For (i), similar to the findings in Gu \\& Dao (2023) and De et al. (2024), we empirically found that complex-valued recurrence is not necessary, as shown in Table 1. The reason why HGRN found it useful is due to state expansion: the complex-valued recurrent state is twice the size of that in the real-valued recurrent state. If we directly expand the real-valued recurrent state size from $d$ to $2 d$, the language modeling performance on the Wikitext-103 corpus is even better. Therefore, we only consider the real-valued recurrence thereafter. For (ii), suppose the total number of layers is L. HGRN introduces a data-independent learnable matrix $\\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $\\Gamma_{i}$ represents the lowest values of the forget gate for the $i$-th layer at all time steps. HGRN argues that this lower bound should be monotonically increasing from bottom to top, encouraging the bottom layers to model short-term local dependencies and the upper layers to model long-term dependencies. To enforce this monotonicity, HGRN uses the cumulative softmax operator cumax (Shen et al., 2018):\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\operatorname{cumax}(\\Gamma)=\\operatorname{cumsum}(\\operatorname{softmax}(\\Gamma, \\operatorname{dim}=0), \\operatorname{dim}=0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}, \\quad \\beta^{i}=[\\beta]_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nTable 1: Comparison of real HGRN and complex HGRN. We found that real HGRN with twice the state size performs better than complex HGRN in Wiki103 language modeling. | Method | State size | PPL(val) | PPL(test) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Complex HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.14 | 24.82 | 46.25 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $d$ | 25.34 | 26.12 | 46.24 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.04 | 24.64 | 45.46 |\n\nTo prevent the lower bound from reaching one in the highest layer, HGRN subtracts all $\\beta$ values by $\\beta^{0}$, making the lower bound for the first layer zero. After obtaining the lower bound values, the forget gate $g_{t}$ learns residuals instead, resulting in a new forget gate $f_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} & =\\beta^{i}+\\left(1-\\beta^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t}^{i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{i} & =\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{i}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t}^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the layer index. This additive lower bound approach has been shown to mitigate the issue of saturated gates Gu et al. 2020). ## 3 Method\n\n### 3.1 Explorations of state expansion methods\n\nThe goal of this work is to scale the size of the HGRN recurrent state from $d$ to $n d$, where $n$ is the state expansion ratio. However, if we use the original parameterization in Eq. 1, the matrices $\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{W}$ will have dimensions $d \\times n d$, which becomes very parameter inefficient when $n$ is large. Ideally, the number of parameters should be around $d^{2}$, as in the original case for each projection. To achieve this, we first consider using structured matrices (e.g., low-rank matrices) to replace the dense projection matrix $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n d}$, as described in Table 2 .

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved significant empirical success in recent years. However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Similar examples also include LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023). Instead of using fixed patterns, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2019) and Sparse Sinkhorn attention (Tay et al., 2020) learn to dynamically pay attention to selected tokens.Variants including Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) apply matrix approximation methods to approximate the full attention matrix but with lower computational complexity. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) introduces a modified form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a) , where the number of attention heads is equal to the size of the feature dimension. It also incorporates a set of learned pairwise positional biases, denoted as $w$. The AFT can be conceptualized as calculating a per-channel weighted average of values. The weight for a specific location is determined by the sum of the key at that location and the corresponding learned positional bias. Token-shift, as first seen in RWKV-4, is a learned per-channel linear interpolation between the current input and the input at the previous time step, intended to enhance the model with a computationally inexpensive mechanism for choosing between new versus older information within various embedding sub-spaces and for forming induction heads even within a single layer. It is instructive to compare token-shift to a 1D convolution with kernel length 2, as it operates in a similar manner but reuses its parameters via an enforced linear relationship. Recent SSMs have begun using short convolutions in a similar placement within their architectures, typically with kernel length 3 to 4.

However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.05)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

L2ight: Enabling On-Chip Learning for Optical Neural Networks via Efficient in-situ Subspace Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Jiaqi Gu, Hanqing Zhu, Chenghao Feng, Zixuan Jiang, Ray T. Chen, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This synergistic framework L2ight is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.\n\n**Abstract:** Silicon-photonics-based optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient AI with its CMOS-compatibility, flexibility, ultra-low execution latency, and high energy efficiency. In-situ training on the online programmable photonic chips is appealing but still encounters challenging issues in on-chip implementability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework L2ight to enable scalable ONN mapping and efficient in-situ learning. L2ight adopts a three-stage learning flow that first calibrates the complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints, then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips. From a co-design perspective, L2ight also provides essential insights for hardware-restricted unitary subspace optimization and efficient sparse training.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 62  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Limiting fluctuation and trajectorial stability of multilayer neural networks with mean field training\n\n*From Search Query: \"state expansion training stability\"*\n\n*H. Pham, Phan-Minh Nguyen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically derive a system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures the limiting fluctuation distribution, and demonstrates through the framework the complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution inherent in the limiting fluctuation.\n\n**Abstract:** The mean field (MF) theory of multilayer neural networks centers around a particular infinite-width scaling, where the learning dynamics is closely tracked by the MF limit. A random fluctuation around this infinite-width limit is expected from a large-width expansion to the next order. This fluctuation has been studied only in shallow networks, where previous works employ heavily technical notions or additional formulation ideas amenable only to that case. Treatment of the multilayer case has been missing, with the chief difficulty in finding a formulation that captures the stochastic dependency across not only time but also depth. In this work, we initiate the study of the fluctuation in the case of multilayer networks, at any network depth. Leveraging on the neuronal embedding framework recently introduced by Nguyen and Pham, we systematically derive a system of dynamical equations, called the second-order MF limit, that captures the limiting fluctuation distribution. We demonstrate through the framework the complex interaction among neurons in this second-order MF limit, the stochasticity with cross-layer dependency and the nonlinear time evolution inherent in the limiting fluctuation. A limit theorem is proven to relate quantitatively this limit to the fluctuation of large-width networks. We apply the result to show a stability property of gradient descent MF training: in the large-width regime, along the training trajectory, it progressively biases towards a solution with\"minimal fluctuation\"(in fact, vanishing fluctuation) in the learned output function, even after the network has been initialized at or has converged (sufficiently fast) to a global optimum. This extends a similar phenomenon previously shown only for shallow networks with a squared loss in the ERM setting, to multilayer networks with a loss function that is not necessarily convex in a more general setting.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Among various approaches, exploiting invariant features by Domain Adversarial Training (DAT) received widespread attention. Despite its success, we observe training instability from DAT, mostly due to over-confident domain discriminator and environment label noise. To address this issue, we proposed Environment Label Smoothing (ELS), which encourages the discriminator to output soft probability, which thus reduces the confidence of the discriminator and alleviates the impact of noisy environment labels. We demonstrate, both experimentally and theoretically, that ELS can improve training stability, local convergence, and robustness to noisy environment labels. By incorporating ELS with DAT methods, we are able to yield state-of-art results on a wide range of domain generalization/adaptation tasks, particularly when the environment labels are highly noisy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. New Insights for the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Online Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"state expansion training stability\"*\n\n*Dahuin Jung, Dongjin Lee, Sunwon Hong, Hyemi Jang, Ho Bae, Sungroh Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network that outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.

Generalized Probabilistic Attention Mechanism in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 time-shift mechanism implementation\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become widely adopted due to its\ndemonstrated success, attributed to the attention mechanism at its core.\nDespite these successes, the attention mechanism of Transformers is associated\nwith two well-known issues: rank-collapse and gradient vanishing. In this\npaper, we present a theoretical analysis that it is inherently difficult to\naddress both issues simultaneously in the conventional attention mechanism. To\nhandle these issues, we introduce a novel class of attention mechanism,\nreferred to as generalized probabilistic attention mechanism (GPAM), and its\ndual-attention implementation within the Transformer architecture. Unlike\nconventional attention mechanisms, GPAM allows for negative attention scores\nwhile preserving a fixed total sum. We provide theoretical evidence that the\nproposed dual-attention GPAM (daGPAM) effectively mitigates both the\nrank-collapse and gradient vanishing issues which are difficult to resolve\nsimultaneously with the conventional attention mechanisms. Furthermore, we\nempirically validate this theoretical evidence, demonstrating the superiority\nof daGPAM compared to other alternative attention mechanisms that were proposed\nto address the same issues. Additionally, we demonstrate the practical benefits\nof GPAM in natural language processing tasks, such as language modeling and\nneural machine translation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-21T01:55:52Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Nevertheless, explanations of how such\nfine-tuning influences the internal computations in these models remain\nelusive. We study how fine-tuning affects the internal mechanisms implemented\nin language models. As a case study, we explore the property of entity\ntracking, a crucial facet of language comprehension, where models fine-tuned on\nmathematics have substantial performance gains. We identify the mechanism that\nenables entity tracking and show that (i) in both the original model and its\nfine-tuned versions primarily the same circuit implements entity tracking. In\nfact, the entity tracking circuit of the original model on the fine-tuned\nversions performs better than the full original model. (ii) The circuits of all\nthe models implement roughly the same functionality: Entity tracking is\nperformed by tracking the position of the correct entity in both the original\nmodel and its fine-tuned versions. (iii) Performance boost in the fine-tuned\nmodels is primarily attributed to its improved ability to handle the augmented\npositional information. To uncover these findings, we employ: Patch Patching,\nDCM, which automatically detects model components responsible for specific\nsemantics, and CMAP, a new approach for patching activations across models to\nreveal improved mechanisms. Our findings suggest that fine-tuning enhances,\nrather than fundamentally alters, the mechanistic operation of the model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-22T18:59:24Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-22T18:59:24Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

TransNormerLLM evolves from the previous\nlinear attention architecture TransNormer by making advanced modifications that\ninclude positional embedding, linear attention acceleration, gating mechanisms,\ntensor normalization, and inference acceleration and stabilization.\nSpecifically, we use LRPE together with an exponential decay to avoid attention\ndilution issues while allowing the model to retain global interactions between\ntokens. Additionally, we propose Lightning Attention, a cutting-edge technique\nthat accelerates linear attention by more than twice in runtime and reduces\nmemory usage by a remarkable four times.

Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Since training with such diverse modalities is challenging, we propose various architectural improvements to stabilize model training. We train our model from scratch on a large multimodal pre-training corpus from diverse sources with a multimodal mixture of denoisers objective. To learn an expansive set of skills, such as following multimodal instructions, we construct and finetune on an ensemble of 120 datasets with prompts and augmentations.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

In language modeling, we show HGRN2 to be highly competitive compared to other subquadratic efficient models. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Gated linear RNN\n\nGiven input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, where the sequence length is $N$ and the model dimension is $d$, a minimalist gated linear recurrent layer (Martin \\& Cundy, 2018) transforms the input $\\mathbf{x}$ into hidden states $\\mathbf{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and the output $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, as defined below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{g}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{u}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{i}_{t} & =\\tau\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{v}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{w}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t} & =\\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{t} & =\\mathbf{h}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{o}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes element-wise product; $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\tau$ is a nonlinear activation function (we choose to use SiLU); $\\mathbf{i}_{t}$ is the input vector; $\\mathbf{g}_{t}$ and $\\mathbf{o}_{t}$ are the forget gate and output gate, respectively. The input gate is tied to the forget gate as $1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}$, a common approach used in many gated RNNs such as GRU (Chung et al., 2014). ### 2.2 HGRN Qin et al. 2023c)\n\nCompared to Eq. 1. HGRN makes two adjustments: (i) complex-valued recurrence and (ii) forget gates with monotonically increased lower bound values from bottom layers to upper layers. For (i), similar to the findings in Gu \\& Dao (2023) and De et al. (2024), we empirically found that complex-valued recurrence is not necessary, as shown in Table 1. The reason why HGRN found it useful is due to state expansion: the complex-valued recurrent state is twice the size of that in the real-valued recurrent state. If we directly expand the real-valued recurrent state size from $d$ to $2 d$, the language modeling performance on the Wikitext-103 corpus is even better. Therefore, we only consider the real-valued recurrence thereafter. For (ii), suppose the total number of layers is L. HGRN introduces a data-independent learnable matrix $\\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $\\Gamma_{i}$ represents the lowest values of the forget gate for the $i$-th layer at all time steps. HGRN argues that this lower bound should be monotonically increasing from bottom to top, encouraging the bottom layers to model short-term local dependencies and the upper layers to model long-term dependencies. To enforce this monotonicity, HGRN uses the cumulative softmax operator cumax (Shen et al., 2018):\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\operatorname{cumax}(\\Gamma)=\\operatorname{cumsum}(\\operatorname{softmax}(\\Gamma, \\operatorname{dim}=0), \\operatorname{dim}=0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}, \\quad \\beta^{i}=[\\beta]_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nTable 1: Comparison of real HGRN and complex HGRN. We found that real HGRN with twice the state size performs better than complex HGRN in Wiki103 language modeling. | Method | State size | PPL(val) | PPL(test) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Complex HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.14 | 24.82 | 46.25 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $d$ | 25.34 | 26.12 | 46.24 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.04 | 24.64 | 45.46 |\n\nTo prevent the lower bound from reaching one in the highest layer, HGRN subtracts all $\\beta$ values by $\\beta^{0}$, making the lower bound for the first layer zero. After obtaining the lower bound values, the forget gate $g_{t}$ learns residuals instead, resulting in a new forget gate $f_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} & =\\beta^{i}+\\left(1-\\beta^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t}^{i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{i} & =\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{i}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t}^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the layer index. This additive lower bound approach has been shown to mitigate the issue of saturated gates Gu et al. 2020). ## 3 Method\n\n### 3.1 Explorations of state expansion methods\n\nThe goal of this work is to scale the size of the HGRN recurrent state from $d$ to $n d$, where $n$ is the state expansion ratio. However, if we use the original parameterization in Eq. 1, the matrices $\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{W}$ will have dimensions $d \\times n d$, which becomes very parameter inefficient when $n$ is large. Ideally, the number of parameters should be around $d^{2}$, as in the original case for each projection. To achieve this, we first consider using structured matrices (e.g., low-rank matrices) to replace the dense projection matrix $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n d}$, as described in Table 2 .

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have achieved significant empirical success in recent years. However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

(2022) and Wan et al. (2023) for a comprehensive and in-depth survey of efficient transformers. Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

A new perspective on building efficient and expressive 3D equivariant graph neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Weitao Du, Yuanqi Du, Limei Wang, Dieqiao Feng, Guifeng Wang, Shuiwang Ji, Carla P. Gomes, Zhixin Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism is proposed to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches to demonstrate the applicability of the theory.\n\n**Abstract:** Geometric deep learning enables the encoding of physical symmetries in modeling 3D objects. Despite rapid progress in encoding 3D symmetries into Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), a comprehensive evaluation of the expressiveness of these networks through a local-to-global analysis lacks today. In this paper, we propose a local hierarchy of 3D isomorphism to evaluate the expressive power of equivariant GNNs and investigate the process of representing global geometric information from local patches. Our work leads to two crucial modules for designing expressive and efficient geometric GNNs; namely local substructure encoding (LSE) and frame transition encoding (FTE). To demonstrate the applicability of our theory, we propose LEFTNet which effectively implements these modules and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scalar-valued and vector-valued molecular property prediction tasks. We further point out the design space for future developments of equivariant graph neural networks.

Parameter Efficient Training of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks by Dynamic Sparse Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*H. Mostafa, Xin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network, and outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern deep neural networks are typically highly overparameterized. Pruning techniques are able to remove a significant fraction of network parameters with little loss in accuracy. Recently, techniques based on dynamic reallocation of non-zero parameters have emerged, allowing direct training of sparse networks without having to pre-train a large dense model. Here we present a novel dynamic sparse reparameterization method that addresses the limitations of previous techniques such as high computational cost and the need for manual configuration of the number of free parameters allocated to each layer. We evaluate the performance of dynamic reallocation methods in training deep convolutional networks and show that our method outperforms previous static and dynamic reparameterization methods, yielding the best accuracy for a fixed parameter budget, on par with accuracies obtained by iteratively pruning a pre-trained dense model. We further investigated the mechanisms underlying the superior generalization performance of the resultant sparse networks. We found that neither the structure, nor the initialization of the non-zero parameters were sufficient to explain the superior performance. Rather, effective learning crucially depended on the continuous exploration of the sparse network structure space during training. Our work suggests that exploring structural degrees of freedom during training is more effective than adding extra parameters to the network.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 286  (*Influential: 33*)\n\n#### 3. Deeply Shared Filter Bases for Parameter-Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Woochul Kang, Daeyeon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a recursive convolution block design and training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradients problem during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massive identical convolution blocks, and, hence, recursive sharing of parameters across these blocks has been proposed to reduce the amount of parameters. However, naive sharing of parameters poses many challenges such as limited representational power and the vanishing/exploding gradients problem of recursively shared parameters. In this paper, we present a recursive convolution block design and training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradients problem during training. We show that the unwieldy vanishing/exploding gradients problem can be controlled by enforcing the elements of the filter basis orthonormal, and empirically demonstrate that the proposed orthogonality regularization improves the flow of gradients during training. Experimental results on image classification and object detection show that our approach, unlike previous parameter-sharing approaches, does not trade performance to save parameters and consistently outperforms overparameterized counterpart networks. This superior performance demonstrates that the proposed recursive convolution block design and the orthogonality regularization not only prevent performance degradation, but also consistently improve the representation capability while a significant amount of parameters are recursively shared.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Our framework is based on gating the output of GNN layers with a mechanism for multi-rate flow of message passing information across nodes of the underlying graph. Local gradients are harnessed to further modulate message passing updates. Our framework flexibly allows one to use any basic GNN layer as a wrapper around which the multi-rate gradient gating mechanism is built. We rigorously prove that G$^2$ alleviates the oversmoothing problem and allows the design of deep GNNs. Empirical results are presented to demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves state-of-the-art performance on a variety of graph learning tasks, including on large-scale heterophilic graphs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Reinforcement Learning with Stacked Hierarchical Attention for Text-based Games\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating mechanisms deep learning\"*\n\n*Yunqiu Xu, Meng Fang, Ling Chen, Yali Du, Joey Tianyi Zhou, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a stacked hierarchical attention mechanism to construct an explicit representation of the reasoning process by exploiting the structure of the knowledge graph for decision making in reinforcement learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We study reinforcement learning (RL) for text-based games, which are interactive simulations in the context of natural language. While different methods have been developed to represent the environment information and language actions, existing RL agents are not empowered with any reasoning capabilities to deal with textual games. In this work, we aim to conduct explicit reasoning with knowledge graphs for decision making, so that the actions of an agent are generated and supported by an interpretable inference procedure. We propose a stacked hierarchical attention mechanism to construct an explicit representation of the reasoning process by exploiting the structure of the knowledge graph. We extensively evaluate our method on a number of man-made benchmark games, and the experimental results demonstrate that our method performs better than existing text-based agents.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Embedded-model flows: Combining the inductive biases of model-free deep learning and explicit probabilistic modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating mechanisms deep learning\"*\n\n*Gianluigi Silvestri, Emily Fertig, David A. Moore, L. Ambrogioni*\n\n**TL;DR:** Embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive biases, enable a high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior model is embedded in the variational architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalizing flows have shown great success as general-purpose density estimators. However, many real world applications require the use of domain-specific knowledge, which normalizing flows cannot readily incorporate. We propose embedded-model flows (EMF), which alternate general-purpose transformations with structured layers that embed domain-specific inductive biases. These layers are automatically constructed by converting user-specified differentiable probabilistic models into equivalent bijective transformations. We also introduce gated structured layers, which allow bypassing the parts of the models that fail to capture the statistics of the data. We demonstrate that EMFs can be used to induce desirable properties such as multimodality, hierarchical coupling and continuity. Furthermore, we show that EMFs enable a high performance form of variational inference where the structure of the prior model is embedded in the variational architecture. In our experiments, we show that this approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in common structured inference problems.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Neural Architecture Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Renqian Luo, Fei Tian, Tao Qin, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that the architecture discovered by this simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources.\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic neural architecture design has shown its potential in discovering powerful neural network architectures. Existing methods, no matter based on reinforcement learning or evolutionary algorithms (EA), conduct architecture search in a discrete space, which is highly inefficient. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient method to automatic neural architecture design based on continuous optimization. We call this new approach neural architecture optimization (NAO). There are three key components in our proposed approach: (1) An encoder embeds/maps neural network architectures into a continuous space. (2) A predictor takes the continuous representation of a network as input and predicts its accuracy. (3) A decoder maps a continuous representation of a network back to its architecture. The performance predictor and the encoder enable us to perform gradient based optimization in the continuous space to find the embedding of a new architecture with potentially better accuracy. Such a better embedding is then decoded to a network by the decoder. Experiments show that the architecture discovered by our method is very competitive for image classification task on CIFAR-10 and language modeling task on PTB, outperforming or on par with the best results of previous architecture search methods with a significantly reduction of computational resources. Specifically we obtain $2.11\\%$ test set error rate for CIFAR-10 image classification task and $56.0$ test set perplexity of PTB language modeling task. The best discovered architectures on both tasks are successfully transferred to other tasks such as CIFAR-100 and WikiText-2. Furthermore, combined with the recent proposed weight sharing mechanism, we discover powerful architecture on CIFAR-10 (with error rate $3.53\\%$) and on PTB (with test set perplexity $56.6$), with very limited computational resources (less than $10$ GPU hours) for both tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 610  (*Influential: 101*)\n\n#### 8. Optimization or Architecture: How to Hack Kalman Filtering\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Ido Greenberg, Netanel Yannay, Shie Mannor*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the KF may become competitive to neural models - if optimized using OKF, and implies that experimental conclusions of certain previous studies were derived from a flawed process.\n\n**Abstract:** In non-linear filtering, it is traditional to compare non-linear architectures such as neural networks to the standard linear Kalman Filter (KF). We observe that this mixes the evaluation of two separate components: the non-linear architecture, and the parameters optimization method. In particular, the non-linear model is often optimized, whereas the reference KF model is not. We argue that both should be optimized similarly, and to that end present the Optimized KF (OKF). We demonstrate that the KF may become competitive to neural models - if optimized using OKF. This implies that experimental conclusions of certain previous studies were derived from a flawed process. The advantage of OKF over the standard KF is further studied theoretically and empirically, in a variety of problems. Conveniently, OKF can replace the KF in real-world systems by merely updating the parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. DNA: Proximal Policy Optimization with a Dual Network Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Mathew H. Aitchison, Penny Sweetser*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that learning these tasks independently, but with a constrained distillation phase, significantly improves performance, and an extension to Proximal Policy Optimization is called \\textit{Dual Network Architecture} (DNA), which significantly outperforms its predecessor.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper explores the problem of simultaneously learning a value function and policy in deep actor-critic reinforcement learning models. We find that the common practice of learning these functions jointly is sub-optimal, due to an order-of-magnitude difference in noise levels between these two tasks. Instead, we show that learning these tasks independently, but with a constrained distillation phase, significantly improves performance. Furthermore, we find that the policy gradient noise levels can be decreased by using a lower \\textit{variance} return estimate. Whereas, the value learning noise level decreases with a lower \\textit{bias} estimate. Together these insights inform an extension to Proximal Policy Optimization we call \\textit{Dual Network Architecture} (DNA), which significantly outperforms its predecessor. DNA also exceeds the performance of the popular Rainbow DQN algorithm on four of the five environments tested, even under more difficult stochastic control settings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Exploring Sparsity in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Sharan Narang, Erich Elsen, Gregory Diamos, Shubho Sengupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are widely used to solve a variety of\nproblems and as the quantity of data and the amount of available compute have\nincreased, so have model sizes. The number of parameters in recent\nstate-of-the-art networks makes them hard to deploy, especially on mobile\nphones and embedded devices. The challenge is due to both the size of the model\nand the time it takes to evaluate it. In order to deploy these RNNs\nefficiently, we propose a technique to reduce the parameters of a network by\npruning weights during the initial training of the network. At the end of\ntraining, the parameters of the network are sparse while accuracy is still\nclose to the original dense neural network. The network size is reduced by 8x\nand the time required to train the model remains constant. Additionally, we can\nprune a larger dense network to achieve better than baseline performance while\nstill reducing the total number of parameters significantly. Pruning RNNs\nreduces the size of the model and can also help achieve significant inference\ntime speed-up using sparse matrix multiply. Benchmarks show that using our\ntechnique model size can be reduced by 90% and speed-up is around 2x to 7x.\n\n**Published:** 2017-04-17T20:42:05Z  (*Updated: 2017-11-06T22:10:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. NEAT: Nonlinear Parameter-efficient Adaptation of Pre-trained Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Yibo Zhong, Haoxiang Jiang, Lincan Li, Ryumei Nakada, Tianci Liu, Linjun Zhang, Huaxiu Yao, Haoyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained models is crucial for adapting large models to\ndownstream tasks, often delivering state-of-the-art performance. However,\nfine-tuning all model parameters is resource-intensive and laborious, leading\nto the emergence of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods. One widely\nadopted PEFT technique, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), freezes the pre-trained\nmodel weights and introduces two low-rank matrices whose ranks are\nsignificantly smaller than the dimensions of the original weight matrices. This\nenables efficient fine-tuning by adjusting only a small number of parameters.\nDespite its efficiency, LoRA approximates weight updates using low-rank\ndecomposition, which struggles to capture complex, non-linear components and\nefficient optimization trajectories. As a result, LoRA-based methods often\nexhibit a significant performance gap compared to full fine-tuning. Closing\nthis gap requires higher ranks, which increases the number of parameters. To\naddress these limitations, we propose a nonlinear parameter-efficient\nadaptation method (NEAT). NEAT introduces a lightweight neural network that\ntakes pre-trained weights as input and learns a nonlinear transformation to\napproximate cumulative weight updates. These updates can be interpreted as\nfunctions of the corresponding pre-trained weights. The nonlinear approximation\ndirectly models the cumulative updates, effectively capturing complex and\nnon-linear structures in the weight updates. Our theoretical analysis\ndemonstrates taht NEAT can be more efficient than LoRA while having equal or\ngreater expressivity. Extensive evaluations across four benchmarks and over\ntwenty datasets demonstrate that NEAT significantly outperforms baselines in\nboth vision and text tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-02T17:29:23Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-02T17:29:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating mechanisms deep learning\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image\nclassification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and\neffectiveness of our proposed model.

In this paper, we propose a novel model termed DLGM via deep\nlearning for hazard classification. Specifically, first, we leverage BERT to\nvectorize the hazard and treat it as a type of time series (HTS). Secondly, we\nbuild a grey model FSGM(1, 1) to model it, and get the grey guidance in the\nsense of the structural parameters. Finally, we design a hierarchical-feature\nfusion neural network (HFFNN) to investigate the HTS with grey guidance (HTSGG)\nfrom three themes, where, HFFNN is a hierarchical structure with four types of\nmodules: two feature encoders, a gating mechanism, and a deepening mechanism.\nWe take 18 industrial processes as application cases and launch a series of\nexperiments. The experimental results prove that DLGM has promising aptitudes\nfor hazard classification and that FSGM(1, 1) and HFFNN are effective.

Which transformer architecture fits my data? A vocabulary bottleneck in\n  self-attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 architecture optimization\"*\n\n*Noam Wies, Yoav Levine, Daniel Jannai, Amnon Shashua*\n\n**Abstract:** After their successful debut in natural language processing, Transformer\narchitectures are now becoming the de-facto standard in many domains. An\nobstacle for their deployment over new modalities is the architectural\nconfiguration: the optimal depth-to-width ratio has been shown to dramatically\nvary across data types (e.g., $10$x larger over images than over language). We\ntheoretically predict the existence of an embedding rank bottleneck that limits\nthe contribution of self-attention width to the Transformer expressivity. We\nthus directly tie the input vocabulary size and rank to the optimal\ndepth-to-width ratio, since a small vocabulary size or rank dictates an added\nadvantage of depth over width. We empirically demonstrate the existence of this\nbottleneck and its implications on the depth-to-width interplay of Transformer\narchitectures, linking the architecture variability across domains to the often\nglossed-over usage of different vocabulary sizes or embedding ranks in\ndifferent domains. As an additional benefit, our rank bottlenecking framework\nallows us to identify size redundancies of $25\\%-50\\%$ in leading NLP models\nsuch as ALBERT and T5.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-09T13:08:26Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-09T17:18:03Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Deep Polynomial Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Stylianos Moschoglou, Grigorios Chrysos, Yannis Panagakis, Stefanos Zafeiriou, Giorgos Bouritsas, Jiankang Deng*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) are currently the method of choice both for generative, as well as for discriminative learning in computer vision and machine learning. The success of DCNNs can be attributed to the careful selection of their building blocks (e.g., residual blocks, rectifiers, sophisticated normalization schemes, to mention but a few). In this paper, we propose $\\Pi$-Nets, a new class of function approximators based on polynomial expansions. $\\Pi$-Nets are polynomial neural networks, i.e., the output is a high-order polynomial of the input. The unknown parameters, which are naturally represented by high-order tensors, are estimated through a collective tensor factorization with factors sharing. We introduce three tensor decompositions that significantly reduce the number of parameters and show how they can be efficiently implemented by hierarchical neural networks. We empirically demonstrate that $\\Pi$-Nets are very expressive and they even produce good results without the use of non-linear activation functions in a large battery of tasks and signals, i.e., images, graphs, and audio. When used in conjunction with activation functions, $\\Pi$-Nets produce state-of-the-art results in three challenging tasks, i.e. image generation, face verification and 3D mesh representation learning.

Exploring Model-based Planning with Policy Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion neural networks\"*\n\n*Jimmy Ba, Tingwu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) with model-predictive control or online planning has shown great potential for locomotion control tasks in terms of both sample efficiency and asymptotic performance. Despite their initial successes, the existing planning methods search from candidate sequences randomly generated in the action space, which is inefficient in complex high-dimensional environments. In this paper, we propose a novel MBRL algorithm, model-based policy planning (POPLIN), that combines policy networks with online planning. More specifically, we formulate action planning at each time-step as an optimization problem using neural networks. We experiment with both optimization w.r.t. the action sequences initialized from the policy network, and also online optimization directly w.r.t. the parameters of the policy network. We show that POPLIN obtains state-of-the-art performance in the MuJoCo benchmarking environments, being about 3x more sample efficient than the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as PETS, TD3 and SAC. To explain the effectiveness of our algorithm, we show that the optimization surface in parameter space is smoother than in action space. Further more, we found the distilled policy network can be effectively applied without the expansive model predictive control during test time for some environments such as Cheetah.

Hierarchical Attentional Hybrid Neural Networks for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating mechanisms deep learning\"*\n\n*Cleber Zanchettin, David Mac\u00eado, Luis Fred, Jader Abreu*\n\n**Abstract:** Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. The deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention recently. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The main contribution of this work is the use of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, generalizable and abstract features by the hierarchical representation. The proposed method in this paper improves the results of the current attention-based approaches for document classification.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Spatial Dependency Networks: Neural Layers for Improved Generative Image Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating mechanisms deep learning\"*\n\n*Joachim M. Buhmann, J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, Stefan Bauer, Aleksandar Stani\u0107, \u0110or\u0111e Miladinovi\u0107*\n\n**Abstract:** How to improve generative modeling by better exploiting spatial regularities and coherence in images? We introduce a novel neural network for building image generators (decoders) and apply it to variational autoencoders (VAEs). In our spatial dependency networks (SDNs), feature maps at each level of a deep neural net are computed in a spatially coherent way, using a sequential gating-based mechanism that distributes contextual information across 2-D space. We show that augmenting the decoder of a hierarchical VAE by spatial dependency layers considerably improves density estimation over baseline convolutional architectures and the state-of-the-art among the models within the same class. Furthermore, we demonstrate that SDN can be applied to large images by synthesizing samples of high quality and coherence. In a vanilla VAE setting, we find that a powerful SDN decoder also improves learning disentangled representations, indicating that neural architectures play an important role in this task. Our results suggest favoring spatial dependency over convolutional layers in various VAE settings.

This work explores methods like LoRA, which involves low-rank parameterization, a technique that could be adapted for state expansion. LoRA's approach to updating weight matrices efficiently could be a basis for developing Group Linear Transformation (GLT) techniques.\n\n## Hierarchical Gating Mechanisms\n\n- Hierarchical gating mechanisms are not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, but the concept of gating in state-space models can be inferred from the discussion on parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. For instance, the use of learnable parameters in fine-tuning methods like LoRA suggests that similar learnable parameters could be integrated into hierarchical gating mechanisms to enhance training stability and convergence.\n\n## Integration with Time-Shift Mechanisms\n\n- The RWKV6 architecture, which includes time-shift mechanisms, is not directly discussed in the provided sources. However, the integration of such mechanisms with state expansion and gating can be inferred from the general principles of state-space models. The paper on \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\" provides insights into how different components of SSMs can be optimized and integrated, which could be applied to RWKV6's time-shift mechanism.\n\n## Applications in Autoregressive Models\n\n- Autoregressive models, particularly those using state-space models like Mamba, are mentioned as powerful tools for language modeling. The paper on \"Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\" suggests that these models can be optimized for better performance, which aligns with the goal of improving autoregressive language models.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Optimizations\n\n- Memory efficiency is a critical aspect, especially when dealing with expanded states. The work on LoRA and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods highlights the use of low-rank parameterization to reduce computational overhead and memory requirements. This approach can be adapted to optimize memory efficiency in state expansion methods.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Differential Geometry Framework**: The paper on \"Engineering flexible machine learning systems by traversing functionally invariant paths\" introduces a framework that could be useful for optimizing the parameter space of neural networks, including those with state expansion and gating mechanisms. This framework can help in identifying invariant subspaces and optimizing the model's architecture for better efficiency and performance.\n\n- **State-Space Model Optimizations**: The detailed analysis of state-space models in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning provides valuable insights into optimizing these models. The findings on the effectiveness of different fine-tuning methods and their implications on model performance and efficiency can be directly applied to the RWKV6-SEF proposal.\n\nBy integrating these concepts and techniques, the researchers can develop a more efficient and expressive autoregressive language model that leverages parameter-efficient state expansion, hierarchical gating mechanisms, and optimized integration with time-shift mechanisms, all while ensuring memory efficiency.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/48 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFigures (2, 3, 3, 8).

Optimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (\"x-formers\") have been introduced to reduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other efficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021). Some recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al., 2019) share similarities with RWKV's chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient, their time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV achieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN. Attention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to scale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing attention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a computationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point where drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense. There has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and its successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work, Poli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the performance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021). Advances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto et al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al., 2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels. While QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as an attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN, RWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable. ## D Time-Mixing Block as an RNN Cell\n\nAs stated in 3.3, the RWKV time-mixing block can be formulated as an RNN, as the $W K V$ computation can be written in such a recursive form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0} & =0 \\\\\nw k v_{t} & =\\frac{a_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}} \\odot v_{t}}{b_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}}} \\\\\na_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot a_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}} \\odot v_{t} \\\\\nb_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot b_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe dataflow of the RNN-like time-mixing is shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg. Score: 0.44)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 state space models\"*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 state space models\"*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory. Theoretical results are justified by numerical verifications.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 state space models\"*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 4. Multichannel End-to-end Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Tsubasa Ochiai, Shinji Watanabe, Takaaki Hori, J.

Using an attention mechanism in a recurrent encoder-decoder architecture solves the dynamic time alignment problem, allowing joint end-to-end training of the acoustic and language modeling components. In this paper we extend the end-to-end framework to encompass microphone array signal processing for noise suppression and speech enhancement within the acoustic encoding network. This allows the beamforming components to be optimized jointly within the recognition architecture to improve the end-to-end speech recognition objective. Experiments on the noisy speech benchmarks (CHiME-4 and AMI) show that our multichannel end-to-end system outperformed the attention-based baseline with input from a conventional adaptive beamformer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 90  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Optimal ANN-SNN Conversion for High-accuracy and Ultra-low-latency Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Tong Bu, Wei Fang, Jianhao Ding, Penglin Dai, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper theoretically analyzes ANN-SNN conversion error, and proposes the quantization clip-floor-shift activation function to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANNs, which can better approximate the activation function of SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained great attraction due to their distinctive properties of low power consumption and fast inference on neuromorphic hardware. As the most effective method to get deep SNNs, ANN-SNN conversion has achieved comparable performance as ANNs on large-scale datasets. Despite this, it requires long time-steps to match the firing rates of SNNs to the activation of ANNs. As a result, the converted SNN suffers severe performance degradation problems with short time-steps, which hamper the practical application of SNNs. In this paper, we theoretically analyze ANN-SNN conversion error and derive the estimated activation function of SNNs. Then we propose the quantization clip-floor-shift activation function to replace the ReLU activation function in source ANNs, which can better approximate the activation function of SNNs. We prove that the expected conversion error between SNNs and ANNs is zero, enabling us to achieve high-accuracy and ultra-low-latency SNNs. We evaluate our method on CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet datasets, and show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art ANN-SNN and directly trained SNNs in both accuracy and time-steps. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time to explore high-performance ANN-SNN conversion with ultra-low latency (4 time-steps).

Dynamic Graph Neural Networks Under Spatio-Temporal Distribution Shift\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Zeyang Zhang, Xin Wang, Ziwei Zhang, Haoyang Li, Zhou Qin, Wenwu Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA), a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns, and proposes an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) have demonstrated powerful predictive abilities by exploiting graph structural and temporal dynamics. However, the existing DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in dynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant with respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns , i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts, which faces two key challenges: 1) How to discover the complex variant and invariant spatio-temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which involve both time-varying graph structures and node features. 2) How to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts with the discovered variant and invariant patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA ). Our proposed method can effectively handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and fully utilizing invariant spatio-temporal patterns. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. Then, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions by sampling and reassembling variant patterns across neighborhoods and time stamps to eliminate the spurious impacts of variant patterns. Lastly, we propose an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities and therefore handle distribution shifts. Experiments on three real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts. Our work is the first study of spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 65  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Zhengxin Zhang, Dan Zhao, Xupeng Miao, Gabriele Oliaro, Qing Li, Yong Jiang, Zhihao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** Quantized Side Tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process, and leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states.\n\n**Abstract:** Finetuning large language models (LLMs) has been empirically effective on a variety of downstream tasks. Existing approaches to finetuning an LLM either focus on parameter-efficient finetuning, which only updates a small number of trainable parameters, or attempt to reduce the memory footprint during the training phase of the finetuning. Typically, the memory footprint during finetuning stems from three contributors: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations. However, existing works still require considerable memory and none can simultaneously mitigate memory footprint for all three sources. In this paper, we present Quantized Side Tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process. First, QST quantizes an LLM's model weights into 4-bit to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's original weights; QST also introduces a side network separated from the LLM, which utilizes the hidden states of the LLM to make task-specific predictions. Using a separate side network avoids performing backpropagation through the LLM, thus reducing the memory requirement of the intermediate activations. Furthermore, QST leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states. Experiments show that QST can reduce the total memory footprint by up to 2.3 $\\times$ and speed up the finetuning process by up to 3 $\\times$ while achieving competent performance compared with the state-of-the-art. When it comes to full finetuning, QST can reduce the total memory footprint up to 7 $\\times$.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. LiteTransformerSearch: Training-free Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Mojan Javaheripi, Gustavo de Rosa, Subhabrata Mukherjee, S. Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Diagonal State Spaces are as Effective as Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 state space models\"*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Albert Gu, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long range dependencies in sequential data is a fundamental step\ntowards attaining human-level performance in many modalities such as text,\nvision, audio and video. While attention-based models are a popular and\neffective choice in modeling short-range interactions, their performance on\ntasks requiring long range reasoning has been largely inadequate.

Combining Neural Networks and Log-linear Models to Improve Relation\n  Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Thien Huu Nguyen, Ralph Grishman*\n\n**Abstract:** The last decade has witnessed the success of the traditional feature-based\nmethod on exploiting the discrete structures such as words or lexical patterns\nto extract relations from text. Recently, convolutional and recurrent neural\nnetworks has provided very effective mechanisms to capture the hidden\nstructures within sentences via continuous representations, thereby\nsignificantly advancing the performance of relation extraction. The advantage\nof convolutional neural networks is their capacity to generalize the\nconsecutive k-grams in the sentences while recurrent neural networks are\neffective to encode long ranges of sentence context.

Task-oriented Memory-efficient Pruning-Adapter\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Guorun Wang, Jun Yang, Yaoru Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** The Outstanding performance and growing size of Large Language Models has led\nto increased attention in parameter efficient learning. The two predominant\napproaches are Adapters and Pruning. Adapters are to freeze the model and give\nit a new weight matrix on the side, which can significantly reduce the time and\nmemory of training, but the cost is that the evaluation and testing will\nincrease the time and memory consumption. Pruning is to cut off some weight and\nre-distribute the remaining weight, which sacrifices the complexity of training\nat the cost of extremely high memory and training time, making the cost of\nevaluation and testing relatively low. So efficiency of training and inference\ncan't be obtained in the same time. In this work, we propose a task-oriented\nPruning-Adapter method that achieve a high memory efficiency of training and\nmemory, and speeds up training time and ensures no significant decrease in\naccuracy in GLUE tasks, achieving training and inference efficiency at the same\ntime.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-26T12:18:00Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-06T03:44:38Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Discovering Neural Wirings\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Mohammad Rastegari, Ali Farhadi, Mitchell Wortsman*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of neural networks has driven a shift in focus from feature engineering to architecture engineering. However, successful networks today are constructed using a small and manually defined set of building blocks. Even in methods of neural architecture search (NAS) the network connectivity patterns are largely constrained. In this work we propose a method for discovering neural wirings. We relax the typical notion of layers and instead enable channels to form connections independent of each other. This allows for a much larger space of possible networks. The wiring of our network is not fixed during training -- as we learn the network parameters we also learn the structure itself. Our experiments demonstrate that our learned connectivity outperforms hand engineered and randomly wired networks. By learning the connectivity of MobileNetV1we boost the ImageNet accuracy by 10% at ~41M FLOPs. Moreover, we show that our method generalizes to recurrent and continuous time networks. Our work may also be regarded as unifying core aspects of the neural architecture search problem with sparse neural network learning. As NAS becomes more fine grained, finding a good architecture is akin to finding a sparse subnetwork of the complete graph. Accordingly, DNW provides an effective mechanism for discovering sparse subnetworks of predefined architectures in a single training run. Though we only ever use a small percentage of the weights during the forward pass, we still play the so-called initialization lottery with a combinatorial number of subnetworks.

RFAConv: Innovating Spatial Attention and Standard Convolutional Operation\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism neural networks\"*\n\n*Yingze Song, Ke Li, Yichen Ye, Tingting Song, Degang Yang, Chen Liu, Xin Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial attention has been widely used to improve the performance of convolutional neural networks. However, it has certain limitations. In this paper, we propose a new perspective on the effectiveness of spatial attention, which is that the spatial attention mechanism essentially solves the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. However, the information contained in the attention map generated by spatial attention is not sufficient for large-size convolutional kernels. Therefore, we propose a novel attention mechanism called Receptive-Field Attention (RFA). Existing spatial attention, such as Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) and Coordinated Attention (CA) focus only on spatial features, which does not fully address the problem of convolutional kernel parameter sharing. In contrast, RFA not only focuses on the receptive-field spatial feature but also provides effective attention weights for large-size convolutional kernels. The Receptive-Field Attention convolutional operation (RFAConv), developed by RFA, represents a new approach to replace the standard convolution operation. It offers nearly negligible increment of computational cost and parameters, while significantly improving network performance. We conducted a series of experiments on ImageNet-1k, COCO, and VOC datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Of particular importance, we believe that it is time to shift focus from spatial features to receptive-field spatial features for current spatial attention mechanisms. In this way, we can further improve network performance and achieve even better results.

Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. LISA: Layerwise Importance Sampling for Memory-Efficient Large Language Model Fine-Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient language models\"*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Chi Han, Jipeng Zhang, Renjie Pi, Shizhe Diao, Xiang Liu, Rui Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** The machine learning community has witnessed impressive advancements since large language models (LLMs) first appeared. Yet, their massive memory consumption has become a significant roadblock to large-scale training. For instance, a 7B model typically requires at least 60 GB of GPU memory with full parameter training, which presents challenges for researchers without access to high-resource environments. Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning techniques such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) have been proposed to alleviate this problem. However, in most large-scale fine-tuning settings, their performance does not reach the level of full parameter training because they confine the parameter search to a low-rank subspace. Attempting to complement this deficiency, we investigate the layerwise properties of LoRA on fine-tuning tasks and observe an unexpected but consistent skewness of weight norms across different layers. Utilizing this key observation, a surprisingly simple training strategy is discovered, which outperforms both LoRA and full parameter training in a wide range of settings with memory costs as low as LoRA. We name it Layerwise Importance Sampled AdamW (LISA), a promising alternative for LoRA, which applies the idea of importance sampling to different layers in LLMs and randomly freezes most middle layers during optimization. Experimental results show that with similar or less GPU memory consumption, LISA surpasses LoRA or even full parameter tuning in downstream fine-tuning tasks, where LISA consistently outperforms LoRA by over 10%-35% in terms of MT-Bench score while achieving on-par or better performance in MMLU, AGIEval and WinoGrande. On large models, specifically LLaMA-2-70B, LISA surpasses LoRA on MT-Bench, GSM8K, and PubMedQA, demonstrating its effectiveness across different domains.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on RWKV6, state-space models, time-shift mechanisms, memory optimization, and integration of gating mechanisms, here are some key points and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## RWKV6 Architecture Details and Implementation\n- The RWKV6 model, as part of the RWKV series, incorporates several advanced techniques such as rotary embeddings, QK-Norm, and ReLU^2. It also uses projection layers initialized to zero (muP-like) and a new optimizer called Muon, which is based on momentum orthogonalized by Newton-Schulz iterations.\n- The model utilizes matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism, which enhance expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs, as mentioned in the context of Eagle and Finch RWKV[Analysis].\n\n## Time-Shift Mechanisms in State-Space Models\n- Time-shift mechanisms are crucial in state-space models like RWKV6, which use dynamic recurrence. These mechanisms allow for the efficient handling of sequential data by shifting and updating the state over time. The Eagle and Finch RWKV paper discusses a dynamic recurrence mechanism that improves expressivity, but specific details on the time-shift mechanism itself would require a deeper dive into the implementation and architecture of RWKV6[Analysis].\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Large Language Models\n- Memory efficiency can be achieved through several techniques:\n  - **Linear Attention Mechanisms**: Papers like the one on LinFusion introduce generalized linear attention paradigms that serve as low-rank approximations of popular linear token mixers. This approach reduces time and memory complexity, making it suitable for high-resolution visual generation and potentially adaptable to language models.\n  - **State Expansion Methods**: Outer-product-based state expansion mechanisms, as discussed in HGRN2, can significantly enlarge the recurrent state size without introducing additional parameters, which is hardware-efficient[Analysis].\n  - **Efficient Optimizers**: The use of optimizers like Muon, which employs Newton-Schulz iterations, can help in reducing computational overhead and improving training efficiency.\n\n## Comparison Between Different State Expansion Methods\n- Comparing different state expansion methods, such as outer-product-based expansion (HGRN2) and additive linear recurrence (LightNet), is crucial. Outer-product-based expansion shows promise for parameter efficiency, while additive linear recurrence avoids the inefficiency caused by multiplicative linear recurrence[Analysis].\n\n## Integration of Gating Mechanisms with State-Space Models\n- Hierarchical gating mechanisms, as discussed in the Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), can be integrated with state-space models to improve stability and convergence. These mechanisms involve learnable bounds and can be optimized for better performance[Analysis].\n- The integration of gating mechanisms with RWKV6's matrix-valued states and dynamic recurrence would require careful consideration of how these mechanisms interact and affect the overall expressivity and efficiency of the model.\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Linear Attention and State-Space Models**: The paper on LinFusion highlights the use of linear attention mechanisms, which can be generalized and applied to state-space models like RWKV6. This could enhance memory efficiency and reduce computational complexity.\n- **Optimization Techniques**: Efficient training and inference can be achieved by optimizing the architecture and training process. For example, using techniques like rotary embeddings and QK-Norm in RWKV6 can improve efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop a more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language model that leverages the strengths of state-space models, linear attention mechanisms, and advanced gating and optimization techniques.\n",

However, serving Transformer-based LLMs is costly due to the expensive KV cache management. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, offer linear inference complexity with constant state size, making them ideal for serving. Consequently, there is substantial interest in studying parallelizable linear recurrent models, such as linear RNNs (Peng et al., 2023; Orvieto et al., 2023, Qin et al., 2023c, De et al., 2024), linear attention (Sun et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b; Yang et al. 2023; 2024; Arora et al., 2024), and state space models (Gu et al. 2022a; Smith et al., 2023 Gu \\& Dao, 2023; Dao \\& Gu, 2024). RNNs have a fixed recurrent state size to encode all historical information. Therefore, it is important for RNNs to (i) utilize the fixed-sized states effectively and (ii) increase the recurrent state size to enhance memory capacity. Recent improvements in linear RNNs follow this approach, incorporating techniques such as data-dependent decays and state expansion. Data-dependent decays (also known as forget gates) are crucial for RNNs (van der Westhuizen \\& Lasenby, 2018), allowing them to selectively retain useful information while erasing irrelevant intormation. This enables the fixed-size recurrent state to store only important information more efficiently. HGRN (Qin et al. 2023c) first emphasized the importance of data-dependent decays for linear RNNs. Many recent linear recurrent models, such as Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), Gated Linear Attention (GLA, Yang et al. 2023), Griffin (De et al., 2024), and RWKV-6 (Peng et al., 2024), also employ data-dependent decays. However, HGRN did not increase the recurrent state size, which is greatly restricted by limited memory capacity. This limitation prevents it from achieving LLaMa-like (Touvron et al., 2023a b) language modeling performance, as noted in Qin et al. (2024). Recent stateof-the-art linear recurrent models, such as Mamba, GLA, and RWKV-6, have addressed this issue by employing state-expansion techniques. These techniques significantly increase the recurrent state size and thereby enhance memory capacity, which has been shown to be\n\n[^0]crucial for language modeling performance and directly correlated with retrieval ability (Arora et al. 2024). In this work, we propose HGRN2, which aims to increase the recurrent state size for HGRN while retaining both parameter and training efficiency. We first explore structured matrices to expand the state size directly in a parameter-efficient manner. Empirically, we found that this approach improves language modeling performance but still encounters training inefficiencies, which limit the scaling of the recurrent state size. Inspired by linear attention, we then explore using a non-parametric outer product-based state expansion mechanism. This approach allows for efficient scaling of the recurrent state size during training without introducing additional parameters. Due to the matrix multiply form of linear attention, we can leverage the hardware-efficient linear attention training algorithm described in Yang et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\n(2023); Qin et al. (2024) for large-scale experiments. As a result, HGRN2 can be regarded as an improved parameterization of GLA. We extensively evaluate HGRN2 across various tasks, demonstrating that it consistently outperforms HGRN1 in multiple domains. In language modeling, we show HGRN2 to be highly competitive compared to other subquadratic efficient models. ## 2 Background\n\n### 2.1 Gated linear RNN\n\nGiven input $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, where the sequence length is $N$ and the model dimension is $d$, a minimalist gated linear recurrent layer (Martin \\& Cundy, 2018) transforms the input $\\mathbf{x}$ into hidden states $\\mathbf{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and the output $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$, as defined below:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{g}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{U} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{u}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{i}_{t} & =\\tau\\left(\\mathbf{V} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{v}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{o}_{t} & =\\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{W} \\mathbf{x}_{t}+\\mathbf{b}_{w}\\right) \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t} & =\\mathbf{g}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t} \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_{t} & =\\mathbf{h}_{t} \\odot \\mathbf{o}_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\odot$ denotes element-wise product; $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function, and $\\tau$ is a nonlinear activation function (we choose to use SiLU); $\\mathbf{i}_{t}$ is the input vector; $\\mathbf{g}_{t}$ and $\\mathbf{o}_{t}$ are the forget gate and output gate, respectively. The input gate is tied to the forget gate as $1-\\mathbf{g}_{t}$, a common approach used in many gated RNNs such as GRU (Chung et al., 2014). ### 2.2 HGRN Qin et al. 2023c)\n\nCompared to Eq. 1. HGRN makes two adjustments: (i) complex-valued recurrence and (ii) forget gates with monotonically increased lower bound values from bottom layers to upper layers. For (i), similar to the findings in Gu \\& Dao (2023) and De et al. (2024), we empirically found that complex-valued recurrence is not necessary, as shown in Table 1. The reason why HGRN found it useful is due to state expansion: the complex-valued recurrent state is twice the size of that in the real-valued recurrent state. If we directly expand the real-valued recurrent state size from $d$ to $2 d$, the language modeling performance on the Wikitext-103 corpus is even better. Therefore, we only consider the real-valued recurrence thereafter. For (ii), suppose the total number of layers is L. HGRN introduces a data-independent learnable matrix $\\Gamma \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$, where $\\Gamma_{i}$ represents the lowest values of the forget gate for the $i$-th layer at all time steps. HGRN argues that this lower bound should be monotonically increasing from bottom to top, encouraging the bottom layers to model short-term local dependencies and the upper layers to model long-term dependencies. To enforce this monotonicity, HGRN uses the cumulative softmax operator cumax (Shen et al., 2018):\n\n$$\n\\beta:=\\operatorname{cumax}(\\Gamma)=\\operatorname{cumsum}(\\operatorname{softmax}(\\Gamma, \\operatorname{dim}=0), \\operatorname{dim}=0) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}, \\quad \\beta^{i}=[\\beta]_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}\n$$\n\nTable 1: Comparison of real HGRN and complex HGRN. We found that real HGRN with twice the state size performs better than complex HGRN in Wiki103 language modeling. | Method | State size | PPL(val) | PPL(test) | Params (M) |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Complex HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.14 | 24.82 | 46.25 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $d$ | 25.34 | 26.12 | 46.24 |\n| Real HGRN1 | $2 d$ | 24.04 | 24.64 | 45.46 |\n\nTo prevent the lower bound from reaching one in the highest layer, HGRN subtracts all $\\beta$ values by $\\beta^{0}$, making the lower bound for the first layer zero. After obtaining the lower bound values, the forget gate $g_{t}$ learns residuals instead, resulting in a new forget gate $f_{t}$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} & =\\beta^{i}+\\left(1-\\beta^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{g}_{t}^{i} \\\\\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}^{i} & =\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i} \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}^{i}+\\left(1-\\mathbf{f}_{t}^{i}\\right) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_{t}^{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the superscript indicates the layer index. This additive lower bound approach has been shown to mitigate the issue of saturated gates Gu et al. 2020). ## 3 Method\n\n### 3.1 Explorations of state expansion methods\n\nThe goal of this work is to scale the size of the HGRN recurrent state from $d$ to $n d$, where $n$ is the state expansion ratio. However, if we use the original parameterization in Eq. 1, the matrices $\\mathbf{U}, \\mathbf{V}, \\mathbf{W}$ will have dimensions $d \\times n d$, which becomes very parameter inefficient when $n$ is large. Ideally, the number of parameters should be around $d^{2}$, as in the original case for each projection. To achieve this, we first consider using structured matrices (e.g., low-rank matrices) to replace the dense projection matrix $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n d}$, as described in Table 2 . Table 2: Parameter Efficient State Expansion (PESE) methods using Einstein Summation notation. Blue represents the input, Black represents data-independent weights, and Red represents the output. We list the Einstein Summation for low-rank (LR), group linear transformation (GLT), group linear transformation with interaction (GLTI), Khatri-Rao product (KRP), and Kronecker product (KP). | Method | Equation | Parameter\\# |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Naive | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{n d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $n d^{2}$ |\n| LR | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{r} \\mathbf{n d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d r(n+1) \\approx d^{2}$ |\n| GLT | $d=(n e) \\rightarrow n e$ <br> $n e, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{e d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}$ |\n| GLTI | $d=(n e) \\rightarrow n e$ <br> $n e, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{e d}, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{n} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}+n^{2}$ |\n| KRP | $d, \\mathbf{n} \\mathbf{d} \\rightarrow n d$ | $n d$ |\n| KP | $d, \\mathbf{d} \\mathbf{d}, \\mathbf{n} \\rightarrow n d$ | $d^{2}+n$ |\n\nAfter obtaining the expanded $\\mathbf{g}, \\mathbf{i}, \\mathbf{o}$, we feed them into element-wise gated linear recurrent layers as in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Many of these efficient transformer variants use some form of nonuniform or local attention mechanisms or a combination thereof. For example, LongFormer (Beltagy et al., 2020) makes use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_919c88d12b3772ebde65g-30.jpg?height=2021&width=957&top_left_y=361&top_left_x=584)\n\nFigure 10: Eagle Overall Architecture. of the sliding window attention and BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) adopts randomized sparse and random attention patterns to approximate full attention. Similar examples also include LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) and StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023). Instead of using fixed patterns, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2019) and Sparse Sinkhorn attention (Tay et al., 2020) learn to dynamically pay attention to selected tokens.Variants including Linformer (Wang et al., 2020), Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) apply matrix approximation methods to approximate the full attention matrix but with lower computational complexity. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) introduces a modified form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020a) , where the number of attention heads is equal to the size of the feature dimension. It also incorporates a set of learned pairwise positional biases, denoted as $w$. The AFT can be conceptualized as calculating a per-channel weighted average of values. The weight for a specific location is determined by the sum of the key at that location and the corresponding learned positional bias. Token-shift, as first seen in RWKV-4, is a learned per-channel linear interpolation between the current input and the input at the previous time step, intended to enhance the model with a computationally inexpensive mechanism for choosing between new versus older information within various embedding sub-spaces and for forming induction heads even within a single layer. It is instructive to compare token-shift to a 1D convolution with kernel length 2, as it operates in a similar manner but reuses its parameters via an enforced linear relationship. Recent SSMs have begun using short convolutions in a similar placement within their architectures, typically with kernel length 3 to 4. (Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023)\n\nRetentive Networks (RetNet) (Sun et al., 2023) introduces a fixed decay rate schedule and xPos (Sun et al., 2022) to linear attention. This design combines positional information with an inductive bias towards recency while still allowing both RNN and parallel implementations.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

We show that this Neural Network-Gaussian Process correspondence surprisingly extends to all modern feedforward or recurrent neural networks composed of multilayer perceptron, RNNs (e.g. LSTMs, GRUs), (nD or graph) convolution, pooling, skip connection, attention, batch normalization, and/or layer normalization. More generally, we introduce a language for expressing neural network computations, and our result encompasses all such expressible neural networks.

Sequence Approximation using Feedforward Spiking Neural Network for Spatiotemporal Learning: Theory and Optimization Methods\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 feedforward architecture\"*\n\n*Xueyuan She, Saurabh Dash, S. Mukhopadhyay*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a theoretical framework to understand and improve sequence approximation using a feedforward SNN, and shows that a feedforward SNN with one neuron per layer and skip-layer connections can approximate the mapping function between any arbitrary pairs of input and output spike train on a compact domain.\n\n**Abstract:** A dynamical system of spiking neurons with only feedforward connections can classify spatiotemporal patterns without recurrent connections. However, the theoretical construct of a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) for approximating a temporal sequence remains unclear, making it challenging to optimize SNN architectures for learning complex spatiotemporal patterns. In this work, we establish a theoretical framework to understand and improve sequence approximation using a feedforward SNN. Our framework shows that a feedforward SNN with one neuron per layer and skip-layer connections can approximate the mapping function between any arbitrary pairs of input and output spike train on a compact domain. Moreover, we prove that heterogeneous neurons with varying dynamics and skip-layer connections improve sequence approximation using feedfor-ward SNN. Consequently, we propose SNN architectures incorporating the preceding constructs that are trained using supervised backpropagation-through-time (BPTT) and unsupervised spiking-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) algorithms for classification of spatiotemporal data. A dual-search-space Bayesian optimization method is developed to optimize architecture and parameters of the proposed SNN with heterogeneous neuron dynamics and skip-layer connections.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3.

With the capacity of pretrained models growing rapidly, how to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become fairly important for quick transfer learning and deployment. In this paper, we design a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks. In particular, we use a shared hypernetwork that takes trainable hyper-embeddings as input, and outputs weights for fine-tuning different small modules in a pretrained language model, such as tuning the parameters inserted into multi-head attention blocks (i.e., prefix-tuning) and feed-forward blocks (i.e., adapter-tuning). We define a set of embeddings (e.g., layer, block, task and visual embeddings) as the key components to calculate hyper-embeddings, which thus can support both pure language and V&L tasks. Our proposed framework adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results on the GLUE benchmark and multiple V&L tasks confirm the effectiveness of our framework on both textual and visual modalities.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. When does Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning Work for Machine Translation?\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion feed forward\"*\n\n*A. Ustun, Asa Cooper Stickland*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive empirical study of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods for machine translation (MT) finds that using PEFTs with a larger pre-trained model outperforms full fine- Tuning with a smaller model, and for smaller training data sizes,PEFTs outperform fullFine Tuning for the same pre- trained model.\n\n**Abstract:** Parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods (PEFTs) offer the promise of adapting large pre-trained models while only tuning a small number of parameters. They have been shown to be competitive with full model fine-tuning for many downstream tasks. However, prior work indicates that PEFTs may not work as well for machine translation (MT), and there is no comprehensive study showing when PEFTs work for MT. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of PEFTs for MT, considering (1) various parameter budgets, (2) a diverse set of language-pairs, and (3) different pre-trained models. We find that \u2018adapters\u2019, in which small feed-forward networks are added after every layer, are indeed on par with full model fine-tuning when the parameter budget corresponds to 10% of total model parameters. Nevertheless, as the number of tuned parameters decreases, the performance of PEFTs decreases. The magnitude of this decrease depends on the language pair, with PEFTs particularly struggling for distantly related language-pairs. We find that using PEFTs with a larger pre-trained model outperforms full fine-tuning with a smaller model, and for smaller training data sizes, PEFTs outperform full fine-tuning for the same pre-trained model.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

However, existing domain-speci\ufb01c PLMs mostly rely on self-supervised learning over large amounts of domain text, without explicitly integrating domain-speci\ufb01c knowledge, which can be essential in many domains. Moreover, in knowledge-sensitive ar-eas such as the biomedical domain, knowledge is stored in multiple sources and formats, and existing biomedical PLMs either neglect them or utilize them in a limited manner. In this work, we introduce an architecture to integrate domain knowledge from diverse sources into PLMs in a parameter-ef\ufb01cient way. More speci\ufb01cally, we propose to encode domain knowledge via adapters , which are small bottleneck feed-forward networks inserted between intermediate transformer layers in PLMs. These knowledge adapters are pre-trained for individual domain knowledge sources and integrated via an attention-based knowledge controller to enrich PLMs. Taking the biomedical domain as a case study, we explore three knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters for PLMs based on the UMLS Metathesaurus graph, the Wikipedia articles for diseases, and the semantic grouping information for biomedical concepts. Extensive experiments on different biomedical NLP tasks and datasets demonstrate the bene\ufb01ts of the proposed architecture and the knowledge-speci\ufb01c adapters across multiple PLMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7.

Our method adapts pre-trained models to larger-scale problems in test time by suggesting two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled adaptation with guided exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation of SAGE based on scale information. Then, SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias, which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location. The locality bias gradually decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative CO tasks.

As a fundamental quantity for measuring statistical relationships, mutual information has been extensively studied and utilized for its generality and equitability. However, existing methods often lack the efficiency needed for real-time applications, such as test-time optimization of a neural network, or the differentiability required for end-to-end learning, like histograms. We introduce a neural network called InfoNet, which directly outputs mutual information estimations of data streams by leveraging the attention mechanism and the computational efficiency of deep learning infrastructures. By maximizing a dual formulation of mutual information through large-scale simulated training, our approach circumvents time-consuming test-time optimization and offers generalization ability. We evaluate the effectiveness and generalization of our proposed mutual information estimation scheme on various families of distributions and applications. Our results demonstrate that InfoNet and its training process provide a graceful efficiency-accuracy trade-off and order-preserving properties.

We characterize the dropout effect on these models in terms\nof the quality and predictive performance of the generated topics.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-28T13:45:39Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-28T13:45:39Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Revisiting SMoE Language Models by Evaluating Inefficiencies with Task\n  Specific Expert Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"RWKV6 feedforward architecture\"*\n\n*Soumajyoti Sarkar, Leonard Lausen, Volkan Cevher, Sheng Zha, Thomas Brox, George Karypis*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) models have emerged as a scalable alternative\nto dense models in language modeling. These models use conditionally activated\nfeedforward subnetworks in transformer blocks, allowing for a separation\nbetween total model parameters and per-example computation. However, large\ntoken-routed SMoE models face a significant challenge: during inference, the\nentire model must be used for a sequence or a batch, resulting in high\nlatencies in a distributed setting that offsets the advantages of per-token\nsparse activation. Our research explores task-specific model pruning to inform\ndecisions about designing SMoE architectures, mainly modulating the choice of\nexpert counts in pretraining. We investigate whether such pruned models offer\nadvantages over smaller SMoE models trained from scratch, when evaluating and\ncomparing them individually on tasks. To that end, we introduce an adaptive\ntask-aware pruning technique UNCURL to reduce the number of experts per MoE\nlayer in an offline manner post-training. Our findings reveal a threshold\npruning factor for the reduction that depends on the number of experts used in\npretraining, above which, the reduction starts to degrade model performance.\nThese insights contribute to our understanding of model design choices when\npretraining with SMoE architectures, particularly useful when considering\ntask-specific inference optimization for later stages.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-02T22:35:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-02T22:35:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Brainformers: Trading Simplicity for Efficiency\n\n*From Search Query: \"parameter efficient state expansion feed forward\"*\n\n*Yanqi Zhou, Nan Du, Yanping Huang, Daiyi Peng, Chang Lan, Da Huang, Siamak Shakeri, David So, Andrew Dai, Yifeng Lu, Zhifeng Chen, Quoc Le, Claire Cui, James Laudon, Jeff Dean*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are central to recent successes in natural language processing\nand computer vision. Transformers have a mostly uniform backbone where layers\nalternate between feed-forward and self-attention in order to build a deep\nnetwork. Here we investigate this design choice and find that more complex\nblocks that have different permutations of layer primitives can be more\nefficient. Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer,\nthat consists of a diverse sets of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward\nlayers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer\nnormalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms\nthe state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality\nand efficiency. A Brainformer model with 8 billion activated parameters per\ntoken demonstrates 2x faster training convergence and 5x faster step time\ncompared to its GLaM counterpart. In downstream task evaluation, Brainformer\nalso demonstrates a 3% higher SuperGLUE score with fine-tuning compared to GLaM\nwith a similar number of activated parameters. Finally, Brainformer largely\noutperforms a Primer dense model derived with NAS with similar computation per\ntoken on fewshot evaluations.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-29T18:42:01Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-25T05:46:01Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

By only activating part of the FFN\nparameters conditioning on input, S-FFN improves generalization performance\nwhile keeping training and inference costs (in FLOPs) fixed. In this work, we\nanalyzed two major design choices of S-FFN: the memory block (a.k.a. expert)\nsize and the memory block selection method under a general conceptual framework\nof sparse neural memory. Using this unified framework, we compare several S-FFN\narchitectures for language modeling and provide insights into their relative\nefficacy and efficiency. We found a simpler selection method --\n\\textbf{\\texttt{Avg-K}} that selects blocks through their mean aggregated\nhidden states, achieving lower perplexity in language model pretraining\ncompared to existing MoE architectures including Switch Transformer (Fedus et\nal., 2021) and HashLayer (Roller et al., 2021).\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23T12:28:37Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-24T03:41:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. SOUL: Unlocking the Power of Second-Order Optimization for LLM\n  Unlearning\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism optimization\"*\n\n*Jinghan Jia, Yihua Zhang, Yimeng Zhang, Jiancheng Liu, Bharat Runwal, James Diffenderfer, Bhavya Kailkhura, Sijia Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have highlighted the necessity of effective\nunlearning mechanisms to comply with data regulations and ethical AI practices.\nLLM unlearning aims at removing undesired data influences and associated model\ncapabilities without compromising utility beyond the scope of unlearning. While\ninterest in studying LLM unlearning is growing, the impact of the optimizer\nchoice for LLM unlearning remains unexplored. In this work, we shed light on\nthe significance of optimizer selection in LLM unlearning for the first time,\nestablishing a clear connection between second-order optimization and influence\nunlearning (a classical approach using influence functions to update the model\nfor data influence removal). This insight propels us to develop a second-order\noptimization-based LLM unlearning framework, termed Second-Order UnLearning\n(SOUL), which extends the static, one-shot model update using influence\nunlearning to a dynamic, iterative unlearning process. Our extensive\nexperiments show that SOUL consistently outperforms conventional first-order\nmethods across various unlearning tasks, models, and metrics, indicating that\nsecond-order optimization offers an effective and broadly applicable solution\nfor LLM unlearning.

Efficient Second-Order Neural Network Optimization via Adaptive Trust\n  Region Methods\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism optimization\"*\n\n*James Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order optimization methods offer notable advantages in training deep\nneural networks by utilizing curvature information to achieve faster\nconvergence. However, traditional second-order techniques are computationally\nprohibitive, primarily due to the large matrix inversions and high memory\ndemands they require. While adaptive trust-region methods have been developed\nto mitigate these issues, their performance is often hindered by conservative\nestimates of key parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian,\nresulting in suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we introduce\nSecondOrderAdaptiveAdam (SOAA), a novel optimization algorithm designed to\novercome these limitations. SOAA approximates the Fisher information matrix\nusing a diagonal representation, reducing computational complexity from\n\\(O(n^{2})\\) to \\(O(n)\\), thereby making it suitable for large-scale deep\nlearning models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the\nalgorithm integrates an adaptive trust-region mechanism that dynamically\nadjusts the trust region size based on observed loss reduction, ensuring both\nrobust convergence and computational efficiency. We empirically demonstrate\nthat SOAA achieves faster and more stable convergence compared to first-order\noptimizers, such as Adam, under similar computational constraints. However, the\ndiagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix may be less effective\nin capturing higher-order interactions between gradients, suggesting potential\nareas for further refinement and future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-03T08:23:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T08:23:06Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Out-of-Distribution Generalization via Risk Extrapolation (REx)\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism optimization\"*\n\n*Remi Le Priol, Dinghuai Zhang, Joern-Henrik Jacobsen, Ethan Caballero, Amy Zhang, Jonathan Binas, David Krueger, Aaron Courville*\n\n**Abstract:** Distributional shift is one of the major obstacles when transferring machine learning prediction systems from the lab to the real world. To tackle this problem, we assume that variation across training domains is representative of the variation we might encounter at test time, but also that shifts at test time may be more extreme in magnitude. In particular, we show that reducing differences in risk across training domains can reduce a model's sensitivity to a wide range of extreme distributional shifts, including the challenging setting where the input contains both causal and anti-causal elements. We motivate this approach, Risk Extrapolation (REx), as a form of robust optimization over a perturbation set of extrapolated domains (MM-REx), and propose a penalty on the variance of training risks (V-REx) as a simpler variant. We prove that variants of REx can recover the causal mechanisms of the targets, while also providing some robustness to changes in the input distribution (\"covariate shift\"). By appropriately trading-off robustness to causally induced distributional shifts and covariate shift, REx is able to outperform alternative methods such as Invariant Risk Minimization in situations where these types of shift co-occur.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. Visual Relation Grounding in Videos\n\n*From Search Query: \"time-shift mechanism optimization\"*\n\n*Tat-Seng Chua, Sheng Tang, Junbin Xiao, Xindi Shang, Xun Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore a novel task named visual Relation Grounding in Videos (vRGV). The task aims at spatio-temporally localizing the given relations in the form of subject-predicate-object in the videos, so as to provide supportive visual facts for other high-level video-language tasks (e.g., video-language grounding and video question answering). The challenges in this task include but not limited to: (1) both the subject and object are required to be spatio-temporally localized to ground a query relation; (2) the temporal dynamic nature of visual relations in videos is difficult to capture; and (3) the grounding should be achieved without any direct supervision in space and time. To ground the relations, we tackle the challenges by collaboratively optimizing two sequences of regions over a constructed hierarchical spatio-temporal region graph through relation attending and reconstruction, in which we further propose a message passing mechanism by spatial attention shifting between visual entities. Experimental results demonstrate that our model can not only outperform baseline approaches significantly, but also produces visually meaningful facts to support visual grounding.

The RWKV model, as described in the RWKV paper, introduces multi-headed matrix-valued states and a dynamic recurrence mechanism. These advancements are likely to be extended or refined in the RWKV6 architecture. Here are some key aspects:\n\n- **Multi-headed Matrix-Valued States**: This design improves expressivity while maintaining inference efficiency characteristics of RNNs. For RWKV6, it is likely that these matrix-valued states are further optimized or expanded upon.\n\n## Parameter-Efficient State Expansion Methods\nSeveral methods have been proposed to achieve parameter-efficient state expansion:\n\n- **Outer-Product-Based Expansion**: As mentioned in the HGRN2 paper, this method allows the recurrent state size to be significantly enlarged without introducing additional parameters. This could be a promising approach for RWKV6FeedForward.\n- **Dense Connections**: The DenseMamba paper highlights that dense connections can enhance information flow and maintain training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Integrating such dense connections into the feedforward architecture could be beneficial.\n\n## Integration of State Expansion with Time-Shift Mechanisms\nThe integration of state expansion with time-shift mechanisms is crucial for maintaining both expressivity and efficiency:\n\n- **Dynamic Recurrence Mechanism**: The RWKV model already incorporates a dynamic recurrence mechanism, which can be optimized further to work seamlessly with state expansion methods. This mechanism could be adjusted to accommodate time-shifts efficiently.\n- **Layerwise Nonlinearity**: Incorporating layer-wise nonlinearity, as discussed in the context of state-space models, can help in maintaining the universal approximator properties while managing the memory and computational overhead.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-Offs in State Expansion\nBalancing state size and computational overhead is essential:\n\n- **Low-Rank Parameterization**: Methods like those described in the parameter-efficient fine-tuning of state space models (e.g., using low-rank parameterization) can help reduce computational overhead while expanding states. This approach can be adapted for feedforward networks.\n- **Dense Connections and Parallelizability**: Ensuring that the expanded states maintain parallelizability, as seen in DenseMamba, is crucial for efficient training and inference.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency Considerations\nFor hardware efficiency, several considerations are important:\n\n- **Optimized Architectures**: Using architectures that are optimized for hardware, such as those employing flash attention or other efficient attention mechanisms, can help in reducing computational overhead.\n- **Memory Management**: Efficient memory management, such as automating memory management through ownership rules and transfer operators, can enhance performance and reduce overhead.\n\n### Future Search Directions\n\n1. **Specific Implementation Details of RWKV6FeedForward**:\n   - Look for papers or preprints that specifically discuss the RWKV6 architecture, focusing on how the feedforward layers are designed and optimized.\n\n2. **Parameter-Efficient State Expansion in Feedforward Networks**:\n   - Investigate papers that discuss state expansion methods in the context of feedforward networks, such as outer-product-based expansion and dense connections.\n\n3. **Integration with Time-Shift Mechanisms**:\n   - Search for studies that integrate state expansion with dynamic recurrence or time-shift mechanisms, ensuring both expressivity and efficiency.\n\n4. **Memory-Computation Trade-Offs and Hardware Efficiency**:\n   - Examine research on low-rank parameterization, dense connections, and other methods that optimize memory and computation trade-offs.\n   - Investigate hardware-specific optimizations and efficient attention mechanisms.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather the necessary information to improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly the RWKV6FeedForward architecture, while ensuring parameter efficiency, integration with time-shift mechanisms, and hardware efficiency.\n",

In RWKV6, while the model demonstrates promising performance and efficient inference, the expressiveness of the feedforward unit\u2014**RWKV6FeedForward**\u2014is limited due to the relatively small hidden state size. This limitation restricts the model's ability to capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies in sequential data.\n\nTo enhance the model's capabilities, there is a need to expand the recurrent state size within the feedforward unit without significantly increasing the number of parameters or computational overhead. Achieving this requires integrating parameter-efficient state expansion methods that can increase expressiveness while maintaining efficiency.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN2)\n\nHGRN2 introduced a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism, allowing the recurrent state size to be significantly enlarged without introducing additional parameters. The model employs Parameter-Efficient State Expansion (PESE) methods, such as Group Linear Transformations (GLT), Khatri-Rao Product (KRP), and Kronecker Product (KP), to achieve state expansion efficiently.\n\n### On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models (S4D)\n\nS4D demonstrated that diagonal state-space models can retain performance comparable to full state-space models while simplifying computations. This approach emphasizes the importance of efficient parameterization and initialization strategies in state-space models.\n\n### Mamba and MambaMixer\n\nMamba integrates selective state spaces into a simplified neural network architecture without attention mechanisms, emphasizing efficient long-sequence modeling. MambaMixer further enhances this by using data-dependent weights and a dual selection mechanism across tokens and channels.\n\n### RWKV6 Architecture\n\nRWKV6 employs a time-mixing mechanism and leverages parameter-efficient designs. However, the feedforward unit still faces limitations in expressiveness due to the constrained hidden state size.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges\n\n- **Limited Expressiveness**: The small hidden state size in **RWKV6FeedForward** hampers the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies and complex patterns.\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Naively increasing the state size would significantly raise the number of parameters, leading to increased computational overhead and potential overfitting.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Maintaining efficiency during both training and inference is crucial for scalability.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\n- **Parameter-Efficient State Expansion (PESE)**: Techniques that enlarge the hidden state size without a proportional increase in parameters. Methods include:\n  - **Group Linear Transformation (GLT)**\n  - **Group Linear Transformation with Interaction (GLTI)**\n  - **Low-Rank Approximations (LR)**\n  - **Khatri-Rao Product (KRP)**\n  - **Kronecker Product (KP)**\n\nBy integrating PESE methods into **RWKV6FeedForward**, we can enhance the model's expressiveness and ability to model long-range dependencies while keeping the parameter count and computational overhead manageable.\n\n### Mathematical Justification\n\nIncreasing the hidden state size \\( n \\) times using PESE methods allows the model to capture higher-order interactions and dependencies in the input sequence without increasing parameters significantly. For example:\n\n- **GLT Method**:\n  - Partition the input vector \\( \\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}^d \\) into \\( n \\) groups.\n  - Apply linear transformations within each group:\n    \\[\n    \\mathbf{y} = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{W}_i \\mathbf{x}_i\n    \\]\n    where \\( \\bigoplus \\) denotes concatenation, \\( \\mathbf{W}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d/n \\times d/n} \\).\n\nTotal parameters remain \\( \\approx d^2 \\), similar to the original feedforward unit, but the output dimension increases to \\( n \\times d \\).\n\n- **Expressiveness**: A larger hidden state can represent more complex functions and capture longer dependencies.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Overview\n\nModify the **RWKV6FeedForward** GAU to incorporate parameter-efficient state expansion using the **Group Linear Transformation (GLT)** method. The key changes include:\n\n1. **State Expansion**: Increase the hidden state size from \\( d \\) to \\( n \\times d \\) without significant parameter increase.\n2. **Structured Matrices**: Use structured projection matrices to maintain parameter efficiency.\n3. **Activation Functions**: Adjust activation functions to handle the expanded state.\n4. **Compatibility**: Ensure the modifications are compatible with the time-shift mechanism and overall RWKV architecture.\n\n### Modifications to RWKV6FeedForward\n\n1. **Input Projection with State Expansion**\n\n   - Replace the existing linear projection with a GLT-based projection.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{U} = \\bigoplus_{i=1}^n \\mathbf{W}_i\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\mathbf{W}_i \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d/n \\times d} \\).\n\n2. **Recurrent Computation with Expanded State**\n\n   - Modify the recurrent computation to handle the expanded state \\( \\mathbf{h}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\).\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{f}_t \\odot \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + (1 - \\mathbf{f}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{i}_t\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\mathbf{f}_t \\) and \\( \\mathbf{i}_t \\) are computed using expanded projections.\n\n3. **Gating Mechanisms**\n\n   - Incorporate hierarchical gating with learnable lower bounds to control information flow.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{f}_t = \\beta + (1 - \\beta) \\odot \\sigma(\\mathbf{U}_f \\mathbf{x}_t)\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\beta \\) is the learnable lower bound that increases with layer depth.\n\n4. **Output Projection**\n\n   - After processing, project the expanded hidden state back to the original dimension.\n   - **Equation**:\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{W}_{\\text{out}} \\mathbf{h}_t\n     \\]\n     where \\( \\mathbf{W}_{\\text{out}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times n d} \\).\n\n5. **Time-Shift Mechanism Compatibility**\n\n   - Ensure the time-shift operation accommodates the expanded state.\n   - Modify the shifting and delta computation accordingly.\n\n### Theoretical Justifications\n\n- **Expressiveness**: Expanding the state size allows the model to represent higher-order correlations in the data.\n- **Parameter Efficiency**: Using structured matrices (e.g., GLT) keeps parameter count at \\( \\approx d^2 \\).\n- **Long-Range Dependencies**: Larger recurrent states can maintain information over longer sequences.\n- **Computational Efficiency**: Structured computations and hardware-efficient implementations prevent significant overhead.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified RWKV6FeedForward\n\n```python\nclass RWKV6FeedForwardSEF(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 state_expansion_ratio: int = 4, device=None, dtype=None, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.state_expansion_ratio = state_expansion_ratio\n        self.expanded_dim = embed_dim * state_expansion_ratio\n        self.group_size = embed_dim // state_expansion_ratio\n\n        # GLT-based Input Projection\n        self.input_proj = nn.ModuleList([\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, self.group_size, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n            for _ in range(state_expansion_ratio)\n        ])\n\n        # Gating Mechanisms with Hierarchical Lower Bounds\n        self.beta = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(state_expansion_ratio, self.group_size, device=device, dtype=dtype))\n        self.sigmoid = nn.Sigmoid()\n        self.silu = nn.SiLU()\n\n        # Output Projection\n        self.output_proj = nn.Linear(self.expanded_dim, embed_dim, bias=False, device=device, dtype=dtype)\n\n        # Time-Shift Mechanism\n        self.time_shift = nn.ZeroPad2d((0, 0, 1, -1))\n\n    def _forward(self, X: torch.Tensor, **Z):\n        shifted = self.time_shift(X)\n        delta = shifted -

Swap the existing feedforward unit with the modified version in the model architecture.\n\n2. **Adjust Hyperparameters**\n\n   - Set the `state_expansion_ratio` based on desired expressiveness and resource constraints.\n\n3. **Ensure Compatibility**\n\n   - Verify that the modified unit integrates seamlessly with the time-shift mechanism and other components.\n\n4. **Training Modifications**\n\n   - Use appropriate initialization strategies for expanded states.\n   - Monitor training for stability and adjust regularization if necessary.\n\n5. **Hardware Optimization**\n\n   - If possible, implement matrix operations to leverage parallelism.\n   - Use hardware-efficient libraries for structured matrix computations.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe proposed **RWKV6-SEF** model enhances the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit by integrating parameter-efficient state expansion methods inspired by HGRN2. By expanding the hidden state size without significantly increasing the number of parameters, the model improves its expressiveness and ability to capture long-range dependencies. The use of structured matrices and hierarchical gating mechanisms ensures computational efficiency and scalability.\n\n**Expected Outcomes and Benefits**:\n\n- **Improved Performance**: Enhanced ability to model complex patterns leads to better language modeling metrics, such as lower perplexity.\n- **Efficiency**: Maintains training and inference efficiency due to parameter-efficient designs and hardware optimizations.\n- **Scalability**: The approach allows for scaling to larger models and longer sequences without prohibitive resource requirements.\n- **Flexibility**: The method can be adapted by adjusting the state expansion ratio based on specific needs.\n\nBy addressing the limitations of the original **RWKV6FeedForward** unit, **RWKV6-SEF** presents a promising direction for developing more powerful and efficient language models.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Qin, Z., Yang, S., Sun, W., Shen, X., Li, D., Sun, W., & Zhong, Y.
