While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 4. Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work finds vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and improves the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

The first to obtain high performance on LRA was the S4 model (Gu et al., 2022a), an instance of linear RNNs augmented according to a complementary theory in continuous time (Gu et al, $2020,2022 b$ ). Following S4, multiple works have proposed simplifications to S4 (Gupta et al., 2022a; Gu et al.||2022b; Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023) or augmentations to other common architectures (Li et al., 2022;, Fu et al., 2023; Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2022), aimed at replicating biases observed in S4 and achieving similar performance on LRA.\n```\n\n#### 5. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M. Zeilinger, Antonio Orvieto*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation, and facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n**Abstract:** Softmax attention is the principle backbone of foundation models for various artificial intelligence applications, yet its quadratic complexity in sequence length can limit its inference throughput in long-context settings. To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Toward Joint Language Modeling for Speech Units and Text\n\n*From Search Query: S4 Model Language Modeling*\n\n*Ju-Chieh Chou, Chung-Ming Chien, Wei-Ning Hsu, Karen Livescu, Arun Babu, Alexis Conneau, Alexei Baevski, Michael Auli*\n\n**TL;DR:** By mixing speech units and text with the proposed mixing techniques, the joint LM improves over a speech-only baseline on SLU tasks and shows zero-shot cross-modal transferability.\n\n**Abstract:** Speech and text are two major forms of human language. The research community has been focusing on mapping speech to text or vice versa for many years. However, in the field of language modeling, very little effort has been made to model them jointly. In light of this, we explore joint language modeling for speech units and text. Specifically, we compare different speech tokenizers to transform continuous speech signals into discrete units and use different methods to construct mixed speech-text data. We introduce automatic metrics to evaluate how well the joint LM mixes speech and text. We also fine-tune the LM on downstream spoken language understanding (SLU) tasks with different modalities (speech or text) and test its performance to assess the model's learning of shared representations. Our results show that by mixing speech units and text with our proposed mixing techniques, the joint LM improves over a speech-only baseline on SLU tasks and shows zero-shot cross-modal transferability.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient SSM Attention*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices.

State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: State Space Transformer*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: S4 Model Language Modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges\n\n*From Search Query: S4 Model Language Modeling*\n\n*Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, Badri Narayana Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient SSM Attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 6. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient SSM Attention*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate State Space Models (SSMs), particularly the Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4), into Transformer architectures for efficient long-range sequence modeling, here are the most relevant and useful insights and references:\n\n## Integration of S4 into Transformer Architectures\n\n- The paper on **Taipan: Efficient and Expressive State Space Language Models** is highly relevant. It introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the Mamba-2 model (a variant of SSMs) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This approach balances the efficiency of SSMs with the performance of Transformers in handling long-range dependencies. The Taipan model extends accurate predictions to context lengths of up to 1 million tokens while preserving computational efficiency, which aligns with the researcher's goal.\n\n## Efficient SSM Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The **LC-PLM: Long-context Protein Language Model** paper discusses the use of selective structured state-space models (BiMamba-S) which introduce a selection mechanism into the S4 model. This allows for input-dependent parameterization of the matrices B, C, and \u2206, enhancing the model's ability to handle long-term dependencies efficiently. This work highlights the importance of efficient parallel computing algorithms to ensure the model's computational efficiency.\n\n## State Space Models for Sequence Modeling\n\n- The **LET SSMS BE CONVNETS: STATE-SPACE MODELING** paper provides a detailed explanation of how state-space models can be configured for neural network processing. It discusses the Centaurus network, which combines elements of classical convolutional blocks with state-space models to achieve better performance and efficiency. This work shows how SSMs can be generalized to enable more connective flexibility, similar to what the researcher aims to achieve by integrating S4 into Transformer architectures.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n- **Linear Computational Complexity**: SSMs like S4 offer linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length, which is crucial for efficient long-context language modeling.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms, as seen in the Taipan model, can balance efficiency and expressiveness, allowing for better handling of long-range dependencies.\n- **Input-Dependent Parameterization**: Introducing input-dependent parameterization in SSMs, as in BiMamba-S, can enhance the model's ability to capture long-term dependencies efficiently.\n- **Parallel Computing**: Efficient training of SSM-based models can be achieved through novel hardware-aware parallel computing algorithms, ensuring linear computational complexity.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Numerical Stability**: Proper parameterization and initialization of SSMs are crucial for stable training. The researcher should refer to works that discuss these aspects in detail.\n- **Compatibility with Existing Components**: Ensuring that the integrated SSM components are compatible with existing Transformer components, such as positional embeddings and gating mechanisms, is essential.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Open-Source Implementations**: Look for open-source implementations of S4 and other SSMs in popular deep learning frameworks like PyTorch to facilitate integration.\n- **Stability and Training Techniques**: Research methods for initializing SSM parameters and techniques for coupling SSMs with attention mechanisms without compromising model stability.\n- **Hybrid Model Designs**: Study existing hybrid models that combine SSMs with Transformers to understand their design choices and performance improvements.\n\nBy focusing on these insights and references, the researcher can effectively integrate S4 into Transformer architectures, enhancing the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies efficiently while maintaining computational efficiency.\n",

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num. AtTn Blocks | 0 (Mamba-2) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 15 | 24 | Transformer++ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Perplexity $\\downarrow$ | 8.60 | 8.38 | 8.32 | 8.29 | 8.29 | 8.28 | $\\mathbf{8 . 2 6}$ | 8.27 | 8.28 | 8.30 | 8.34 | 8.50 | 8.68 |\n\nHybrid Models with SSD, MLP, and Attention We compare different ways that SSD can be combined with the (gated) MLP and attention layers, and evaluate at the 2.7B scale (64 layers), trained to 300B tokens on the Pile (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set, same data order):\n\n1. Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold. We compare different ways SSD, MLP, and attention layers can be combined, evaluated at 2.7 B scale trained to 300 B tokens on the Pile. | MODEl | Token. | PILE <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | HellaSwag <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | PIQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-E <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-C <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | WinoGrande <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | OpenbookQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Average <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Transformer++ | NeoX | 6.13 | 3.99 | $\\underline{70.3}$ | 66.4 | 75.2 | 67.7 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 63.9 | 40.4 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2 | NeoX | 6.09 | 4.10 | 69.7 | 66.6 | 76.4 | 69.6 | 36.4 | 64.0 | 38.8 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP | NeoX | 6.13 | 4.18 | 69.3 | 65.0 | 76.4 | 68.1 | 37.0 | 63.1 | 38.2 | 59.6 |\n| Mamba-2-Attention | NeoX | 5.95 | 3.85 | 71.1 | 67.8 | $\\underline{75.8}$ | 69.9 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 65.3 | 39.0 | 61.0 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP-Attention | NeoX | 6.00 | 3.95 | 70.0 | 66.6 | 75.4 | 70.6 | 38.6 | 64.6 | 39.2 | 60.7 |\n\n### 9.3 Speed Benchmarks\n\nWe benchmark the speed of the SSD algorithm against Mamba's scan implementation and FlashAttention-2 (Figure 10). SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat. ## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advance on efficient sequence modeling with State Space Models (SSMs) [GGR21; GDE ${ }^{+}$20; GGGR22; GB22; SWL23] has shown impressive performance for a wide range of tasks across modalities, such as text classification, image recognition and speech recognition. SSMs, as firstorder linear models, defined by a set of input, output, and state variables connected by first-order differential equations, can efficiently capture the recurrent structure in sequential data with carefully designed state matrices and the application of convolutional parallelism [GGR21]. However, they still significantly underperform the self-attention [BCB14; $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17] based model in both language modeling and machine translation [VPSP23] tasks. A recent work [FDS ${ }^{+}$23] reveals that this is due to its deficiency of modeling the second-order pairwise comparisons between the input tokens, and shows that the augmentation of an additional shifted SSM layer can improve SSM's associative recalling\n\n[^0]ability. Furthermore, better quality-efficiency trade-off can be achieved by directly introducing extra self-attention modules to form a hybrid model (e.g. MEGA [MZK ${ }^{+}$23] and Hybrid H3 [FDS ${ }^{+}$23]) that utilizes both the first and the second order inductive biases, i.e., SSM and self-attention. However, the current hybrid models apply the attention modules statically and uniformly to each of the input token regardless the property of the task itself. This can lead to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs since not all input tokens require second-order modeling and this computation need can vary substantially depending on both its context and the task difficulty. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions for efficiently combining attention with SSMs:\n\n- RQ1: Can neural networks learn to activate their attention modules on demand to achieve better quality-efficiency trade-off? - RQ2: How much extra attention is needed for the SSMs on a task-by-task basis? To answer these questions, we develop a new general mechanism, Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), that allows a neural network to sparsely and dynamically activate its sub-modules for each of the input token in a fully differentiable manner. Specifically, we assume a neural model can be composed of multiple heterogeneous sub-modules. For the input sequence, a latent configurator sparsely maps tokens to multiple compressed sequences corresponding to sub-modules. Each sub-module is then only applied on its mapped shorter sequence. Compared with activating all sub-modules on the whole input, Sparse Modular Activation can reduce computation and memory consumption for both the training and inference stages. Notably, SMA is proved to have a full coverage of the combinatorial search space of module activation, which is further explained in Section 3.2. Efficient learning of dynamic sparsity is notoriously difficult under the constraint of the current parallel hardware [LQC ${ }^{+} 22$; GZYE20; XM22]. To enable the practical efficiency gains from our module-level sparsity, we provide a simple yet efficient parallel implementation of SMA without any custom fused GPU kernels. Specifically, when compressing a batch of sequences in SMA, our implementation conducts both token selection and the sequence re-padding simultaneously using a single scatter operation that is widely optimized and present in modern deep learning frameworks. To address RQ1, we apply SMA to construct a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, that sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) [HDLL22] based on the state representation learned from an SSM. Both the GAU and the SSM representations are then aggregated through simple addition and activation to form a layer-level representation. Multiple same-sized SeqBoat layers are stacked sequentially to form a full neural model. Inspired by the working memory mechanism [AS68] used in human cognition, we further restrict the GAU to only apply local attention on the compressed sequence, which allows our model to have linear sequence inference complexity but theoretically infinite attention span. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SeqBoat has significantly better qualityefficiency trade-off than state-of-the-art hybrid models on a wide range of tasks, including Long Range Arena (LRA) [TDA ${ }^{+}$20], speech classification [War18] and language modeling [Hut06]. On the competitive LRA benchmark, SeqBoat achieves 1.96 higher average accuracy than MEGA-chunk $\\left[\\mathrm{MZK}^{+} 23\\right]$, the previous best hybrid model, with a $10.4 \\times$ training speed up and a $95 \\%$ memory reduction compared to the Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17] on the Text task with 4,096 input length. Thanks to the intrinsic modular sparsity brought by SMA, SeqBoat directly reveals the amount of attention needed for each data sample of each task through its sparse activation patterns of GAU, addressing RQ2. We demonstrate that our working memory mechanism provides substantially better computation-accuracy trade-off than chunking based models, and analyze the relationship between the working memory size and the effective attention span on various long sequence modeling tasks. ## 2 Background\n\nTo motivate and clarify our proposed techniques, we first present a mathematical formulation of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism and show how it encompasses and generalizes previous attempts that aimed for module-level dynamic sparsity. A dedicated section for detailed comparisons between our approach with the related works is also included in Appendix F. We begin by reviewing how the standard sequence modeling is formalized to establish the common ground for our discussion. ### 2.1 Time-Invariant Sequence Modeling\n\nGiven a discrete sequence, $\\mathbf{x}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, consisting of $n$ tokens, a time-invariant sequence model $P_{\\theta}$ is optimized to maximize the likelihood of the observed sequences by factorizing them as follows:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{<t}, \\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t-1}\\right\\}$ is the sequence history at time step $t$, and the parameter $\\theta$ is independent of the time step $t$. This formulation implies that the full model parameters $\\theta$ and the full history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$ are both essential for the conditional prediction of each token $x_{t}$. However, one potential issue is as the prediction difficulty of each token may differ depending on the context and the position, this static model $P_{\\theta}$ can lead to sub-optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off by wasting computation on either unimportant context $\\left[\\mathrm{SJP}^{+} 21\\right]$ or easy-to-predict tokens [Gra16]. ## 3 Learning Sparse Modular Activation\n\nTo cover a larger search space that may contain more efficient sequence models, we propose to formulate sequence modeling as a problem of finding an optimal time-variant model that can dynamically activate a subset of modules from a pre-defined function space for each time step. ### 3.1 Time-Variant Sequence Modeling\n\nFormally, a time-variant sequence model is defined on a compact function space $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$, where $V$ is the size of the vocabulary and $\\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}: \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t} \\in \\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}$, contains all possible sub-sequences of the sequence history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$. Then for each of the token prediction at the time step $t$, the model learns to apply a function $f_{t} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with the parameters $\\theta_{t}$ that maximizes the sequence probability, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\max _{f_{t}, \\theta_{t}, \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}} P_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P_{f_{t}}\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}, \\theta_{t}\\right) \\quad \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t}\n$$\n\nThis formulation generalizes the previous works in pursuing a dynamic and sparse model for sequence modeling, where the connections are further explained in Appendix F. In this work, we assume the function space $\\mathcal{F}$ is chain-structured, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{H} \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{N} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{1} \\circ \\mathcal{E}$, where $\\mathcal{H}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$ is the classification function, $\\mathcal{E}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the embedding function, $N$ is the number of intermediate layers, $d_{m}$ is the model size and $\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the function space of the intermediate mappings. We further assume that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the spanning set of a finite number of the function $f_{i}^{l}$ with its parameters $\\theta_{i}^{l}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{f_{1}^{l}, \\ldots, f_{M}^{l}\\right\\}$, where $M$ is the number of pre-defined functions. These assumptions justify the design of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism, which is further explained in the following section. ### 3.2 Sparse Modular Activation\n\nSparse Modular Activation (SMA) introduces a latent configurator at each time step $t$ and each layer of a neural sequence model.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

The superior performance of Transformers is attributed to the self-attention mechanism, which enables the model to aggregate the information from the input sequence. In contrast to its success, self-attention mechanism has a potential problem that it requires a large amount of computation and memory. To deal with this issue, many studies have been attempted to develop efficient models that can replace Transformers. Among them, Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have garnered considerable interest recently. One advantage of SSMs is that the output can be computed with a significantly small time using convolution via FFT algorithm or recursive computation. Based on the original SSMs, many improvements have been proposed, such as HiPPO-based intialization (Gu et al. 2021) and architectures using gated convolutions (Fu et al. 2022, Poli et al., 2023). Networks based on SSMs have accomplished high performance in various applications such as gene analysis (Nguyen et al., 2024), audio generation (Goel et al., 2022) and speech recognition (Saon et al. 2023). On the other hand, some of the recent studies pointed out the limitations of SSMs, especially for their abilities to solve tasks. For example, Merrill et al. (2024) show that SSMs cannot solve sequential problems from the view of computational complexity theory. Additionally, Gu and Dao (2023) pointed out that SSMs are less effective for the tasks to handle discrete and information-dense data such as language processing. Therefore, it is still unclear in what situation we can replace Transformers with SSMs. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5e098f2beaae0c90c478g-02.jpg?height=258&width=1373&top_left_y=245&top_left_x=368)\n\nFigure 1.1: Conceptual illustrations of the abilities of SSMs. Left: This represents the classification task in which the existence of the token \" $A$ \" or \" $B$ \" is important. We prove that SSMs can extract such tokens, even if the position of the important token is different for each input. Right: This illustrate the task to predict the next token in the sequence. In this task, models have to output the token associated with the last token. We also prove that SSMs can solve such tasks, i.e., SSMs can extract appropriate tokens even if the position of essential tokens are different for each token in the same sequence. Recently, some studies have theoretically investigated the abilities of SSMs. For instance, Wang and Xue (2024) show that SSMs are universal approximators for continuous sequence-to-sequence functions. Additionally, Massaroli et al. (2024) constructed the parameters of SSMs to solve the task called associated recall. Moreover, Cirone et al. (2024) studied the abilities of SSMs using rough path theory. However, they mainly focus on the expressive power of SSMs and do not provide statistical understanding. Furthermore, quantitative evaluations to compare SSMs and Transformers is limited. Leaving aside SSMs, many studies have investigated the abilities of deep neural networks to estimate functions. Some of them analyze the estimation abilities of fully connected neural networks (FNNs) with the assumption that the target function is in certain function classes (Schmidt-Hieber, 2020, Suzuki, 2018) or have a specific smoothness structure (Suzuki and Nitanda, 2021). Moreover, Nakada and Imaizumi (2020) and Chen et al. (2022) consider the setting that the data distribution has a low-dimensional structure. Additionally, Okumoto and Suzuki (2021) studied convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and showed that CNNs can estimate the functions that have smoothness structures with the minimax optimal rate even if the input is infinite-dimensional. As for the Transformers, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate the functions with infinitedimensional input as well as CNNs. Additionally, they showed that Transformers can estimate the functions whose smoothness structure changes depending on the input. Our contributions. In this paper, we explore the abilities of SSMs with gated convolution to replace Transformers from the perspective of statistical learning theory. More specifically, we investigate the estimation ability of SSMs for the function classes called $\\gamma$-smooth and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth. For the function in these classes, Takakura and Suzuki (2023) showed that Transformers can estimate them effectively. We prove that SSMs can also estimate those functions with the same convergence rate as Transformers, and show that SSMs can replace Transformers when estimating those functions. The essential point of the two function classes above is that they have smoothness structures. As for $\\gamma$-smooth functions, the smoothness of the function is the same for all input sequences, i.e., the important features to extract are fixed. On the other hand, piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions have different smoothness depending on the input. This function class characterizes the ability of Transformers and SSMs to extract important features dynamically. In addition to the settings considered in Takakura and Suzuki (2023), we also consider the functions whose smoothness structure also changes depending on the position output token. This setting is inspired by the ability of Transformers to solve the task called associative recall (Ba et al. 2016). We show that SSMs can also replace Transformers in this setting. See Figure 1.1 for the conceptual illustrations of those function classes. The contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:\n\n1. We theoretically investigate the estimation ability of SSMs with gated convolutions for $\\gamma$ smooth functions and piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth functions. We show that SSMs can achieve the same estimation error as Transformers, which implies that SSMs may be alternative to Transformers in terms of estimating functions in those classes. 2. Inspired by recent research on the abilities of Transformers, we define function classes that are extensions of the piecewise $\\gamma$-smooth function class. Then, we prove that SSMs can also attain the similar estimation error for those classes. Other related works. The function classes with piecewise smoothness are also considered in Petersen and Voigtlaender (2018) and Imaizumi and Fukumizu (2019). They do not consider anisotropic smoothness or the sequence-to-sequence functions, while we consider such situations. One of the other directions to investigate the abilities of SSMs is to utilize the control theory, like Alonso et al. (2024). Instead of focusing on the statistical aspect, they mainly provide a comprehensive understanding of existing SSMs. Gu and DaO (2023) proposed an SSM-based architecture called Mamba, whose filter is controlled by the input. While convolution with FFT algorithms cannot be used for Mamba, they proposed a hardware-aware efficient implementation. In this paper, we do not focus on the setting that filters are controlled by the input, and we consider SSMs with gated convolution with data-independent filters.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates the efficiencies of State Space Models (SSMs) with the strengths of Transformer architectures, aiming to outperform current state-of-the-art models in several key areas:\n\n## Key Objectives\n- **Efficient Long-Range Sequence Modeling**: The researcher aims to leverage SSMs for their linear complexity and efficient handling of long sequences, which is a limitation of traditional Transformer models due to their quadratic complexity.\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms to balance efficiency and expressiveness.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content. (Right Bottom) The Induction Heads task is an example of associative recall that requires retrieving an answer based on context, a key ability for LLMs. ```\nAlgorithm 1 SSM (S4)\nAlgorithm 2 SSM + Selection (S6)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nInput: \\(x:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\nOutput: \\(y:(B, L, D)\\)\n    1: \\(A:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    1: \\(\\boldsymbol{A}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n\\(\\triangleright\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n                            \\(>\\) Represents structured \\(N \\times N\\) matrix\n        B \\(:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n    2: \\(\\boldsymbol{B}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow s_{B}(x)\\)\n        \\(C:(D, N) \\leftarrow\\) Parameter\n        \\(\\Delta:(\\mathrm{D}) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\) (Parameter)\n        \\(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}:(\\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, A, B)\\)\n        \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n            \\(\\Delta\\) Time-invariant: recurrence or convolution\n    return \\(y\\)\n    3: \\(C:(B, L, N) \\leftarrow s_{C}(x)\\)\n    4: \\(\\Delta:(B, L, D) \\leftarrow \\tau_{\\Delta}\\left(\\right.\\) Parameter \\(\\left.+s_{\\Delta}(x)\\right)\\)\n    5: \\(\\bar{A}, \\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}:(\\mathrm{B}, \\mathrm{L}, \\mathrm{D}, \\mathrm{N}) \\leftarrow \\operatorname{discretize}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})\\)\n    6: \\(y \\leftarrow \\operatorname{SSM}(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)(x)\\)\n        \\(\\Delta\\) Time-varying: recurrence (scan) only\n    7: return \\(y\\)\n```\n\n\n### 3.3 Efficient Implementation of Selective SSMs\n\nHardware-friendly primitives such as convolutions (Krizhevsky, Sutskever, and Hinton 2012) and attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017) enjoy widespread application. Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks. We use the SiLU / Swish activation function (Hendrycks and Gimpel 2016; Ramachandran, Zoph, and Quoc V Le 2017), motivated so that the Gated MLP becomes the popular \"SwiGLU\" variant (Chowdhery et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nMany subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference ( $5 \\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nFoundation models (FMs), or large models pretrained on massive data then adapted for downstream tasks, have emerged as an effective paradigm in modern machine learning. The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$. Concretely, S 4 models are defined with four parameters $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, which define a sequence-to-sequence transformation in two stages. $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h^{\\prime}(t)=A h(t)+B x(t) \\quad \\text { (1a) } \\quad h_{t}=\\bar{A} h_{t-1}+\\bar{B} x_{t} \\\\\n& \\bar{K}=\\left(C \\bar{B}, C \\overline{A B}, \\ldots, C \\bar{A}^{k} \\bar{B}, \\ldots\\right) \\\\\n& y(t)=\\operatorname{Ch}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nDiscretization. The first stage transforms the \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, A, B)$ to \"discrete parameters\" $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ through fixed formulas $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{A}}=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A})$ and $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{B}}=f_{B}(\\Delta, \\boldsymbol{A}, \\boldsymbol{B})$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Various rules can be used such as the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$ defined in equation (4). $$\n\\bar{A}=\\exp (\\Delta A) \\quad \\bar{B}=(\\Delta A)^{-1}(\\exp (\\Delta A)-I) \\cdot \\Delta B\n$$\n\nDiscretization has deep connections to continuous-time systems which can endow them with additional properties such as resolution invariance (Nguyen, Goel, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Selective State Space Models, Mamba architecture implementation, Gated State Spaces GSS\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset.

These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks.

Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba architecture implementation*\n\n*Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hybrid model is introduced, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently, and suggests that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6. Towards Better Dynamic Graph Learning: New Architecture and Unified Library\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba architecture implementation*\n\n*Le Yu, Leilei Sun, Bowen Du, Weifeng Lv*\n\n**TL;DR:** DyGFormer, a new Transformer-based architecture for dynamic graph learning, achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nodes' correlations and long-term temporal dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose DyGFormer, a new Transformer-based architecture for dynamic graph learning. DyGFormer is conceptually simple and only needs to learn from nodes' historical first-hop interactions by: (1) a neighbor co-occurrence encoding scheme that explores the correlations of the source node and destination node based on their historical sequences; (2) a patching technique that divides each sequence into multiple patches and feeds them to Transformer, allowing the model to effectively and efficiently benefit from longer histories. We also introduce DyGLib, a unified library with standard training pipelines, extensible coding interfaces, and comprehensive evaluating protocols to promote reproducible, scalable, and credible dynamic graph learning research. By performing exhaustive experiments on thirteen datasets for dynamic link prediction and dynamic node classification tasks, we find that DyGFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance on most of the datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nodes' correlations and long-term temporal dependencies. Moreover, some results of baselines are inconsistent with previous reports, which may be caused by their diverse but less rigorous implementations, showing the importance of DyGLib.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 146  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 8. GLIF: A Unified Gated Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Neuron for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated State Spaces GSS*\n\n*Xing-Hua Yao, Fanrong Li, Zitao Mo, Jianguo Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio- features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons and increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiker neurons.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been studied over decades to incorporate their biological plausibility and leverage their promising energy efficiency. Throughout existing SNNs, the leaky integrate-and-fire (LIF) model is commonly adopted to formulate the spiking neuron and evolves into numerous variants with different biological features. However, most LIF-based neurons support only single biological feature in different neuronal behaviors, limiting their expressiveness and neuronal dynamic diversity. In this paper, we propose GLIF, a unified spiking neuron, to fuse different bio-features in different neuronal behaviors, enlarging the representation space of spiking neurons. In GLIF, gating factors, which are exploited to determine the proportion of the fused bio-features, are learnable during training. Combining all learnable membrane-related parameters, our method can make spiking neurons different and constantly changing, thus increasing the heterogeneity and adaptivity of spiking neurons. Extensive experiments on a variety of datasets demonstrate that our method obtains superior performance compared with other SNNs by simply changing their neuronal formulations to GLIF. In particular, we train a spiking ResNet-19 with GLIF and achieve $77.35\\%$ top-1 accuracy with six time steps on CIFAR-100, which has advanced the state-of-the-art.

MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

In this work we focus\non autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and\nArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the\neffectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated\nState Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the\ndiagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several\nwell-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to\nlonger inputs while being straightforward to implement.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. PyramidMamba: Rethinking Pyramid Feature Fusion with Selective Space State Model for Semantic Segmentation of Remote Sensing Imagery\n\n*From Search Query: Selective State Space Models*\n\n*Danfeng Hong, Xiaokang Zhang, Xiaoliang Meng, Sijun Dong, Dongxu Li, Libo Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for intelligent interpretation of remote sensing images, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial-temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN- and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, the actual multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in multi-scale feature fusion. Comprehensive ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on three publicly available datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets.

VMamba: Visual State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba architecture implementation*\n\n*Yunfan Liu, Qixiang Ye, YaoWei Wang, Lingxi Xie, Hongtian Yu, Yuzhong Zhao, Yunjie Tian, Yue Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing computationally efficient network architectures persists as an ongoing necessity in computer vision. In this paper, we transplant Mamba, a state-space language model, into VMamba, a vision backbone that works in linear time complexity. At the core of VMamba lies a stack of Visual State-Space (VSS) blocks with the 2D Selective Scan (SS2D) module. By traversing along four scanning routes, SS2D helps bridge the gap between the ordered nature of 1D selective scan and the non-sequential structure of 2D vision data, which facilitates the gathering of contextual information from various sources and perspectives. Based on the VSS blocks, we develop a family of VMamba architectures and accelerate them through a succession of architectural and implementation enhancements. Extensive experiments showcase VMamba's promising performance across diverse visual perception tasks, highlighting its advantages in input scaling efficiency compared to existing benchmark models.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Mamba architecture implementation*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mamba-360: Survey of State Space Models as Transformer Alternative for Long Sequence Modelling: Methods, Applications, and Challenges\n\n*From Search Query: Gated State Spaces GSS*\n\n*Vijay Srinivas Agneeswaran, Badri Narayana Patro*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling is a crucial area across various domains, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), speech recognition, time series forecasting, music generation, and bioinformatics. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Long Short Term Memory Networks (LSTMs) have historically dominated sequence modeling tasks like Machine Translation, Named Entity Recognition (NER), etc. However, the advancement of transformers has led to a shift in this paradigm, given their superior performance. Yet, transformers suffer from $O(N^2)$ attention complexity and challenges in handling inductive bias. Several variations have been proposed to address these issues which use spectral networks or convolutions and have performed well on a range of tasks. However, they still have difficulty in dealing with long sequences. State Space Models(SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context, especially with the advent of S4 and its variants, such as S4nd, Hippo, Hyena, Diagnol State Spaces (DSS), Gated State Spaces (GSS), Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU), Liquid-S4, Mamba, etc. In this survey, we categorize the foundational SSMs based on three paradigms namely, Gating architectures, Structural architectures, and Recurrent architectures. This survey also highlights diverse applications of SSMs across domains such as vision, video, audio, speech, language (especially long sequence modeling), medical (including genomics), chemical (like drug design), recommendation systems, and time series analysis, including tabular data. Moreover, we consolidate the performance of SSMs on benchmark datasets like Long Range Arena (LRA), WikiText, Glue, Pile, ImageNet, Kinetics-400, sstv2, as well as video datasets such as Breakfast, COIN, LVU, and various time series datasets.

Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat. ## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advance on efficient sequence modeling with State Space Models (SSMs) [GGR21; GDE ${ }^{+}$20; GGGR22; GB22; SWL23] has shown impressive performance for a wide range of tasks across modalities, such as text classification, image recognition and speech recognition. SSMs, as firstorder linear models, defined by a set of input, output, and state variables connected by first-order differential equations, can efficiently capture the recurrent structure in sequential data with carefully designed state matrices and the application of convolutional parallelism [GGR21]. However, they still significantly underperform the self-attention [BCB14; $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17] based model in both language modeling and machine translation [VPSP23] tasks. A recent work [FDS ${ }^{+}$23] reveals that this is due to its deficiency of modeling the second-order pairwise comparisons between the input tokens, and shows that the augmentation of an additional shifted SSM layer can improve SSM's associative recalling\n\n[^0]ability. Furthermore, better quality-efficiency trade-off can be achieved by directly introducing extra self-attention modules to form a hybrid model (e.g. MEGA [MZK ${ }^{+}$23] and Hybrid H3 [FDS ${ }^{+}$23]) that utilizes both the first and the second order inductive biases, i.e., SSM and self-attention. However, the current hybrid models apply the attention modules statically and uniformly to each of the input token regardless the property of the task itself. This can lead to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs since not all input tokens require second-order modeling and this computation need can vary substantially depending on both its context and the task difficulty. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions for efficiently combining attention with SSMs:\n\n- RQ1: Can neural networks learn to activate their attention modules on demand to achieve better quality-efficiency trade-off? - RQ2: How much extra attention is needed for the SSMs on a task-by-task basis? To answer these questions, we develop a new general mechanism, Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), that allows a neural network to sparsely and dynamically activate its sub-modules for each of the input token in a fully differentiable manner. Specifically, we assume a neural model can be composed of multiple heterogeneous sub-modules. For the input sequence, a latent configurator sparsely maps tokens to multiple compressed sequences corresponding to sub-modules. Each sub-module is then only applied on its mapped shorter sequence. Compared with activating all sub-modules on the whole input, Sparse Modular Activation can reduce computation and memory consumption for both the training and inference stages. Notably, SMA is proved to have a full coverage of the combinatorial search space of module activation, which is further explained in Section 3.2. Efficient learning of dynamic sparsity is notoriously difficult under the constraint of the current parallel hardware [LQC ${ }^{+} 22$; GZYE20; XM22]. To enable the practical efficiency gains from our module-level sparsity, we provide a simple yet efficient parallel implementation of SMA without any custom fused GPU kernels. Specifically, when compressing a batch of sequences in SMA, our implementation conducts both token selection and the sequence re-padding simultaneously using a single scatter operation that is widely optimized and present in modern deep learning frameworks. To address RQ1, we apply SMA to construct a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, that sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) [HDLL22] based on the state representation learned from an SSM. Both the GAU and the SSM representations are then aggregated through simple addition and activation to form a layer-level representation. Multiple same-sized SeqBoat layers are stacked sequentially to form a full neural model. Inspired by the working memory mechanism [AS68] used in human cognition, we further restrict the GAU to only apply local attention on the compressed sequence, which allows our model to have linear sequence inference complexity but theoretically infinite attention span. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SeqBoat has significantly better qualityefficiency trade-off than state-of-the-art hybrid models on a wide range of tasks, including Long Range Arena (LRA) [TDA ${ }^{+}$20], speech classification [War18] and language modeling [Hut06]. On the competitive LRA benchmark, SeqBoat achieves 1.96 higher average accuracy than MEGA-chunk $\\left[\\mathrm{MZK}^{+} 23\\right]$, the previous best hybrid model, with a $10.4 \\times$ training speed up and a $95 \\%$ memory reduction compared to the Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17] on the Text task with 4,096 input length. Thanks to the intrinsic modular sparsity brought by SMA, SeqBoat directly reveals the amount of attention needed for each data sample of each task through its sparse activation patterns of GAU, addressing RQ2. We demonstrate that our working memory mechanism provides substantially better computation-accuracy trade-off than chunking based models, and analyze the relationship between the working memory size and the effective attention span on various long sequence modeling tasks. ## 2 Background\n\nTo motivate and clarify our proposed techniques, we first present a mathematical formulation of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism and show how it encompasses and generalizes previous attempts that aimed for module-level dynamic sparsity. A dedicated section for detailed comparisons between our approach with the related works is also included in Appendix F. We begin by reviewing how the standard sequence modeling is formalized to establish the common ground for our discussion. ### 2.1 Time-Invariant Sequence Modeling\n\nGiven a discrete sequence, $\\mathbf{x}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, consisting of $n$ tokens, a time-invariant sequence model $P_{\\theta}$ is optimized to maximize the likelihood of the observed sequences by factorizing them as follows:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{<t}, \\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t-1}\\right\\}$ is the sequence history at time step $t$, and the parameter $\\theta$ is independent of the time step $t$. This formulation implies that the full model parameters $\\theta$ and the full history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$ are both essential for the conditional prediction of each token $x_{t}$. However, one potential issue is as the prediction difficulty of each token may differ depending on the context and the position, this static model $P_{\\theta}$ can lead to sub-optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off by wasting computation on either unimportant context $\\left[\\mathrm{SJP}^{+} 21\\right]$ or easy-to-predict tokens [Gra16]. ## 3 Learning Sparse Modular Activation\n\nTo cover a larger search space that may contain more efficient sequence models, we propose to formulate sequence modeling as a problem of finding an optimal time-variant model that can dynamically activate a subset of modules from a pre-defined function space for each time step. ### 3.1 Time-Variant Sequence Modeling\n\nFormally, a time-variant sequence model is defined on a compact function space $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$, where $V$ is the size of the vocabulary and $\\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}: \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t} \\in \\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}$, contains all possible sub-sequences of the sequence history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$. Then for each of the token prediction at the time step $t$, the model learns to apply a function $f_{t} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with the parameters $\\theta_{t}$ that maximizes the sequence probability, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\max _{f_{t}, \\theta_{t}, \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}} P_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P_{f_{t}}\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}, \\theta_{t}\\right) \\quad \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t}\n$$\n\nThis formulation generalizes the previous works in pursuing a dynamic and sparse model for sequence modeling, where the connections are further explained in Appendix F. In this work, we assume the function space $\\mathcal{F}$ is chain-structured, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{H} \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{N} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{1} \\circ \\mathcal{E}$, where $\\mathcal{H}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$ is the classification function, $\\mathcal{E}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the embedding function, $N$ is the number of intermediate layers, $d_{m}$ is the model size and $\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the function space of the intermediate mappings. We further assume that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the spanning set of a finite number of the function $f_{i}^{l}$ with its parameters $\\theta_{i}^{l}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{f_{1}^{l}, \\ldots, f_{M}^{l}\\right\\}$, where $M$ is the number of pre-defined functions. These assumptions justify the design of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism, which is further explained in the following section. ### 3.2 Sparse Modular Activation\n\nSparse Modular Activation (SMA) introduces a latent configurator at each time step $t$ and each layer of a neural sequence model.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models by integrating Selective State Space Models (SSMs) into the FastTTTLinear Gated Attention Unit (GAU), here are the key points and most useful information extracted from the provided analysis:\n\n### Key Goals and Objectives\n- Enhance the FastTTTLinear GAU to model long-range dependencies efficiently.\n- Incorporate input-dependent parameterization and gating mechanisms from SSMs.\n- Maintain computational efficiency, scalability, and numerical stability.\n\n### Critical Components\n\n#### Selective State Space Models (SSMs)\n- **Input-Dependent Parameterization**: This allows the model to perform content-based reasoning, enabling selective propagation or forgetting of information based on the current token.

Summary of Analysis**\n\nThe proposal aims to enhance the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)** with input-dependent parameterization and gating mechanisms inspired by the **Mamba** architecture. This integration seeks to improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently and perform content-based reasoning, which is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\nFrom the latest search results, several works have explored hybrid models combining SSMs with attention mechanisms to address limitations in SSMs' in-context learning abilities. Integrating SSMs into architectures similar to FastTTTLinear appears to be a novel approach, with potential benefits for accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n**2.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num. AtTn Blocks | 0 (Mamba-2) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 9 | 11 | 15 | 24 | Transformer++ |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Perplexity $\\downarrow$ | 8.60 | 8.38 | 8.32 | 8.29 | 8.29 | 8.28 | $\\mathbf{8 . 2 6}$ | 8.27 | 8.28 | 8.30 | 8.34 | 8.50 | 8.68 |\n\nHybrid Models with SSD, MLP, and Attention We compare different ways that SSD can be combined with the (gated) MLP and attention layers, and evaluate at the 2.7B scale (64 layers), trained to 300B tokens on the Pile (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set, same data order):\n\n1. Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold.

SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts.

Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These results show that while Transformers, cross-channel attention, and cross-channel MLPs are sufficient for good performance in practice, neither is necessary. ## 1 Introduction\n\nIn recent years, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have been the pivotal backbone architecture behind deep learning's success, enabling a number of breakthrough advances in language modeling (Wolf et al., 2019), vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), time series (Zhou et al., 2021), healthcare (Tang et al., 2023), and several other domains (Radford et al., 2023; Behrouz et al., 2023). The attention modules in Transformers are crucial for their data dependency and enable them to generalize to unseen data and tasks given the context as input. They, however, are difficult to scale efficiently to long sequences due to their quadratic time and space complexity. Breaking this quadratic computational cost is a key step towards new possibilities for deep learning such as long-range\ncontext learning (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), large object detection (Zhu et al., 2024), and long-range time series forecasting (Liu et al., 2021a). To alleviate this computational complexity bottleneck, several recent studies have focused on designing sub-quadratic sequence models motivated by a diverse range of objectives: i.e., MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021) and ConvMixer (Trockman \\& Kolter, 2023) are motivated as simpler alternatives to attention modules, MonarchMixer (M2) (Fu et al., 2023a) tackles efficiency without losing quality by using sparse Monarch matrices, and efficient attentions (Xiao et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023; Ding et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2021) sparsify or approximate the full attention matrix. These methods, however, either (1) are based on data-independent parameters, (2) introduce a trade-off between expressivity and speed, underperforming relative to Transformers when are scalable and efficient, or (3) are actually slow in practice, due to low hardware utilization (Dao et al., 2022; Chen et al., 2021). Recently, structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling (Gu et al., 2022b; Fu et al., 2023b; Smith et al., 2023). SSMs can be seen as a combination of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), making them very efficient in training (as a CNN) and inference (as an RNN) (Gu et al., 2020). Despite their efficiency, primary general SSM architectures, e.g., S4 (Gu et al., 2022b), S4D (Gu et al., 2022a), are based on data-independent parameters, limiting their effectiveness in compressing context into a smaller state (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). To alleviate this limitation, recently, Gu \\& Dao (2023) present Mamba, a selective SSMs (S6) that effectively selects relevant context by making the SSM weights time variant (i.e., data dependent). Mamba achieves on par performance with Transformer-based state-of-the-art methods in language modeling while having less parameters and scaling near-linearly in sequence length (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), addressing all the three abovementioned limitations. The success of Mamba motivates several studies to adapt its design to different domains and modalities, e.g., vision (Zhu et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024), graphs (Behrouz \\& Hashemi, 2024), videos (Li et al., 2024), DNA modeling (Schiff et al., 2024), etc. Surprisingly, Mamba and its variants independently apply the S6 block to each channel, overlooking information flow across channels (also known as Channel Mixing). The lack of channel mixing in Mamba not only results in stability issues while scaling to large-sized networks (Patro \\& Agneeswaran, 2024), but it also cause missing the relationships among feature maps, limiting Mamba's ability to model global information in multi-dimensional data such as images and multivariate time series. Using additional channel mixing blocks for S6 blocks, however, might be challenging in large-scale networks as due to their recurrent nature, increasing the number of blocks for both token and channel mixing can damage the information flow, limiting their ability to use early features. In this paper, we present MambaMixer, an efficient selective state space models with dual selection across both channels and tokens. MambaMixer sequentially uses Selective Token Mixer and Selective Channel Mixer, each of which consists of a bidirectional S6 block (Gu \\& Dao, 2023), to efficiently select and mix (resp. filter) informative (resp. irrelevant) tokens and channels. Contrary to original Mamba block that uses simple skip connections between consecutive blocks, inspired by DenseNet (Huang et al., 2017) and DenseFormer (Pagliardini et al., 2024), MambaMixer block allows layers to have direct access to earlier features (i.e., inputs and outputs of earlier layers) and further enhances the information flow between selective channel and token mixer blocks as well as different layers using a weighted averaging mechanism, enabling MambaMixer-based models to use a large number of layers and making training more stable for large networks. As a proof of concept, we employ MambaMixer block to design Vision MambaMixer (ViM2) and Time Series MambaMixer (TSM2) for vision and time series forecasting tasks, respectively. ViM2 first tokenizes the images and uses Cross-Scan Module (CSM) (Liu et al., 2024) to vertically and horizontally scan images, determining the order of tokens. It then, uses a MambaMixer block to selectively mixes tokens and channels. While TSM2 shares very similar architecture with ViM2, Contrary to ViM2, it uses unidirectional S6 blocks for time dimension due to its causal nature and inspired by (Chen et al., 2023), it uses an additional MambaMixer block to selectively mix auxiliary information of time series (whenever is available) as well as a 2-dimensional normalization across both time and variate dimensions. We further explore the performance of proposed models in various vision and time series forecasting tasks. In ImageNet classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation tasks, ViM2 achieves competitive performance with well-established vision models, and outperforms SSM-based vision models. In time series forecasting, TSM2 achieves outstanding performance compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets with diverse domains.

Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Understanding the Goal and Intent\n\nThe researcher aims to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)** with the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU), inspired by the **Mamba** architecture.

This framework yields insights on how recent SSMs (e.g. Mamba) perform as well as Transformers on language modeling. Moreover, our theoretical tools provide new ideas to improve SSMs (and potentially Transformers) by connecting the algorithmic and systems advances on both sides.

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/37 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n# An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models \n\nRoger Waleffe ${ }^{1,2 *}$ Wonmin Byeon ${ }^{1}$ Duncan Riach ${ }^{1}$ Brandon Norick ${ }^{1 \\dagger}$<br>Vijay Korthikanti ${ }^{1}$ Tri Dao ${ }^{3,4}$ Albert Gu ${ }^{5,6}$ Ali Hatamizadeh ${ }^{1}$ Sudhakar Singh ${ }^{1}$<br>Deepak Narayanan ${ }^{1}$ Garvit Kulshreshtha ${ }^{1}$ Vartika Singh ${ }^{1}$ Jared Casper ${ }^{1}$<br>Jan Kautz ${ }^{1}$ Mohammad Shoeybi ${ }^{1}$ Bryan Catanzaro ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ NVIDIA $\\quad{ }^{2}$ University of Wisconsin-Madison ${ }^{3}$ Princeton University<br>${ }^{4}$ Together AI $\\quad{ }^{5}$ Carnegie Mellon University ${ }^{6}$ Cartesia AI\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSelective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)** with **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) and incorporates **Mamba-inspired gating mechanisms**, here are some key areas and specific information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Novelty Assessment\n- **Recent Publications**: Search for papers published in 2023 and 2024 to ensure that the proposed integration is novel.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/37 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models \n\nRoger Waleffe ${ }^{1,2 *}$ Wonmin Byeon ${ }^{1}$ Duncan Riach ${ }^{1}$ Brandon Norick ${ }^{1 \\dagger}$<br>Vijay Korthikanti ${ }^{1}$ Tri Dao ${ }^{3,4}$ Albert Gu ${ }^{5,6}$ Ali Hatamizadeh ${ }^{1}$ Sudhakar Singh ${ }^{1}$<br>Deepak Narayanan ${ }^{1}$ Garvit Kulshreshtha ${ }^{1}$ Vartika Singh ${ }^{1}$ Jared Casper ${ }^{1}$<br>Jan Kautz ${ }^{1}$ Mohammad Shoeybi ${ }^{1}$ Bryan Catanzaro ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ NVIDIA $\\quad{ }^{2}$ University of Wisconsin-Madison ${ }^{3}$ Princeton University<br>${ }^{4}$ Together AI $\\quad{ }^{5}$ Carnegie Mellon University ${ }^{6}$ Cartesia AI\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSelective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"FastTTTLinear and State Space Models\", \"Integration of SSMs into FastTTTLinear\", \"SSM-enhanced FastTTTLinear\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Specifically, we give a \\textit{data-dependent} generalization bound for SSMs, showing an interplay between the SSM parameters and the temporal dependencies of the training sequences. Leveraging the generalization bound, we (1) set up a scaling rule for model initialization based on the proposed generalization measure, which significantly improves the robustness of the output value scales on SSMs to different temporal patterns in the sequence data; (2) introduce a new regularization method for training SSMs to enhance the generalization performance. Numerical results are conducted to validate our results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Mastering Memory Tasks with World Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM-enhanced FastTTTLinear\"*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Samsami, Artem Zholus, Janarthanan Rajendran, Sarath Chandar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work integrates a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I), which aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Current model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) agents struggle with long-term dependencies. This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Zico Kolter, Sanjiv Kumar, Srinadh Bhojanapalli*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that state space models such as Mamba are significantly\nworse than Transformers on recall-based tasks due to the fact that their state\nsize is constant with respect to their input sequence length. But in practice,\nstate space models have fairly large state sizes, and we conjecture that they\nshould be able to perform much better at these tasks than previously reported.\nWe investigate whether their poor copying and recall performance could be due\nin part to training difficulties rather than fundamental capacity constraints.\nBased on observations of their \"attention\" maps, we propose a structured\ninitialization technique that allows state space layers to more readily mimic\nattention. Across a variety of architecture settings, our initialization makes\nit substantially easier for Mamba to learn to copy and do associative recall\nfrom scratch.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-14T23:17:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

In this work, we show that one can\nmatch the performance of S4 even without the low rank correction and thus\nassuming the state matrices to be diagonal.

This is exemplified by the recent success of Mamba, showing better\nperformance than the state-of-the-art Transformer architectures in language\ntasks.

Therefore, SSMs can be naturally connected to deep sequence\nmodeling, offering the opportunity to create synergies between the\ncorresponding research areas. This paper is intended as a gentle introduction\nto SSM-based architectures for control theorists and summarizes the latest\nresearch developments. It provides a systematic review of the most successful\nSSM proposals and highlights their main features from a control theoretic\nperspective.

Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWe use the same models configurations as done in Aky\u00fcrek et al.

Notably, hybrid architectures excel on this benchmark, converging much faster both Mamba and Transformer while achieving higher accuracy. Given prior evidence that Standard Hybrid achieves lower perplexity in language modeling ( $\\mathrm{Gu} \\&$ Dao, 2023), our new results suggest that hybrid models offer a promising direction for both language modeling and in-context learning on language tasks. We hope these results and analysis demonstrate the potential of hybrid models for language-based applications of ICL. ## 6 Discussion\n\nIn this work, we have provided a comprehensive investigation of in-context learning with state-space models (SSMs) and contrasted them with the Transformer architecture. Our study has revealed that SSMs, especially Mamba, are capable in-context learners. On the other hand, our evaluations revealed that neither SSMs nor Transformers are great at all tasks: SSMs struggle with decision tree and retrieval tasks whereas Transformers struggle with sparse parity. This has led us to the hybrid architecture MambaFormer which achieves a best-of-both-worlds performance on our ICL suite. Future research directions include exploring (1) how the performance on our ICL suite correlates with general language modeling capabilities, such as perplexity on standard NLP benchmarks, (2) developing more effective architectures by integrating elements from transformers, SSMs, and gating mechanisms, (3) identifying architectural features that contribute to effective in-context learning, and (4) assessing the impact of MambaFormer and other innovative architectures on language modeling performance. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive study of language modeling architectures which help identify their weaknesses, strengths, and provide recipes for new architectures.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid models SSM and attention\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: \"State space models FastTTTLinear integration\"*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

A state-space model for inferring effective connectivity of latent neural dynamics from simultaneous EEG/fMRI\n\n*From Search Query: \"State space models FastTTTLinear integration\"*\n\n*Tao Tu, J. Paisley, S. Haufe, P. Sajda*\n\n**TL;DR:** A linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data is developed and the results emphasize the importance of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Inferring effective connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions is important for understanding human brain dynamics in health and disease. Non-invasive neuroimaging modalities, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are often used to make measurements and infer connectivity. However most studies do not consider integrating the two modalities even though each is an indirect measure of the latent neural dynamics and each has its own spatial and/or temporal limitations. In this study, we develop a linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data. Our method first identifies task-dependent and subject-dependent regions of interest (ROI) based on the analysis of fMRI data. Directed influences between the latent neural states at these ROIs are then modeled as a multivariate autogressive (MVAR) process driven by various exogenous inputs. The latent neural dynamics give rise to the observed scalp EEG measurements via a biophysically informed linear EEG forward model. We use a mean-field variational Bayesian approach to infer the posterior distribution of latent states and model parameters. The performance of the model was evaluated on two sets of simulations. Our results emphasize the importance of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI. Finally, we applied the model to simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data from 10 subjects during a Face-Car-House visual categorization task and compared the change in connectivity induced by different stimulus categories.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method. We also show that R2I is faster than the state-of-the-art MBRL method, DreamerV3, resulting in faster wall-time convergence.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

However, attention mechanisms and neural\nnetwork models struggle with syntactic constraints. The quadratic complexity of\nattention mechanisms also limits their adoption for capturing long-range\ndependencies between aspect and opinion words in ABSA. This complexity can lead\nto the misinterpretation of irrelevant contextual words, restricting their\neffectiveness to short-range dependencies. To address the above problem, we\npresent a novel approach to enhance long-range dependencies between aspect and\nopinion words in ABSA (MambaForGCN).

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid models SSM and attention\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences.

This misinformation exhibits\nconcept drift, where the distribution of fake news changes over time, reducing\neffectiveness of previously trained models for fake news detection. Given a set\nof fake news models trained on multiple domains, we propose an adaptive\ndecision module to select the best-fit model for a new sample. We propose\nMiDAS, a multi-domain adaptative approach for fake news detection that ranks\nrelevancy of existing models to new samples. MiDAS contains 2 components: a\ndoman-invariant encoder, and an adaptive model selector. MiDAS integrates\nmultiple pre-trained and fine-tuned models with their training data to create a\ndomain-invariant representation. Then, MiDAS uses local Lipschitz smoothness of\nthe invariant embedding space to estimate each model's relevance to a new\nsample. Higher ranked models provide predictions, and lower ranked models\nabstain. We evaluate MiDAS on generalization to drifted data with 9 fake news\ndatasets, each obtained from different domains and modalities. MiDAS achieves\nnew state-of-the-art performance on multi-domain adaptation for\nout-of-distribution fake news classification.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-19T19:36:08Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-19T19:36:08Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SST: Multi-Scale Hybrid Mamba-Transformer Experts for Long-Short Range Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: \"MambaFormer\"*\n\n*Liang Zhao, Guangji Bai, Baixiang Huang, Canyu Chen, Kai Shu, Yueqing Liang, Xiongxiao Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite significant progress in time series forecasting, existing forecasters often overlook the heterogeneity between long-range and short-range time series, leading to performance degradation in practical applications. In this work, we highlight the need of distinct objectives tailored to different ranges. We point out that time series can be decomposed into global patterns and local variations, which should be addressed separately in long- and short-range time series. To meet the objectives, we propose a multi-scale hybrid Mamba-Transformer experts model State Space Transformer (SST). SST leverages Mamba as an expert to extract global patterns in coarse-grained long-range time series, and Local Window Transformer (LWT), the other expert to focus on capturing local variations in fine-grained short-range time series. With an input-dependent mechanism, State Space Model (SSM)-based Mamba is able to selectively retain long-term patterns and filter out fluctuations, while LWT employs a local window to enhance locality-awareness capability, thus effectively capturing local variations. To adaptively integrate the global patterns and local variations, a long-short router dynamically adjusts contributions of the two experts. SST achieves superior performance with scaling linearly $O(L)$ on time series length $L$. The comprehensive experiments demonstrate the SST can achieve SOTA results in long-short range time series forecasting while maintaining low memory footprint and computational cost. The code of SST is available at https://github.com/XiongxiaoXu/SST.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"MambaFormer\"*\n\n*Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Kangwook Lee, Samet Oymak, Jaewoong Cho, Nayoung Lee, Zheyang Xiong, Jaeseung Park, Jongho Park*\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid models SSM and attention\"*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid models SSM and attention\"*\n\n*Zhenzhang Li, Yubiao Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the era of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been extensively studied and widely used in medical image classification tasks. Unfortunately, CNN's limitations in modeling long-range dependencies result in poor classification performances. In contrast, ViTs are hampered by the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism, making them difficult to deploy in real-world settings with limited computational resources. Recent studies have shown that state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by it, we proposed MedMamba, the first Vision Mamba for generalized medical image classification. Concretely, we introduced a novel hybrid basic block named SS-Conv-SSM, which purely integrates the convolutional layers for extracting local features with the abilities of SSM to capture long-range dependencies, aiming to model medical images from different image modalities efficiently. By employing the grouped convolution strategy and channel-shuffle operation, MedMamba successfully provides fewer model parameters and a lower computational burden for efficient applications without sacrificing accuracy. We thoroughly evaluated MedMamba using 16 datasets containing ten imaging modalities and 411,007 images. Experimental results show that MedMamba demonstrates competitive performance on most tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This work aims to explore the potential of Vision Mamba and establish a new baseline for medical image classification, thereby providing valuable insights for developing more powerful Mamba-based artificial intelligence algorithms and applications in medicine. The source codes and all pre-trained weights of MedMamba are available at https://github.com/YubiaoYue/MedMamba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block that integrates **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)** with the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU), here are the key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Novelty and Feasibility\n\n- **Integration of SSMs with FastTTTLinear**:\n  - The proposal is novel as there is no existing work that explicitly combines SSMs with FastTTTLinear GAU.

However, modeling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a significant challenge. The FastTTTLinear GAU in the seed design aims to provide efficient sequence modeling but lacks the ability to perform content-based reasoning essential for capturing long-term dependencies in language data.
