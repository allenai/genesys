For each position, our BiPE blends an intra-segment encoding and an inter-segment encoding. The intra-segment encoding identifies the locations within a segment and helps the model capture the semantic information therein via absolute positional encoding. The inter-segment encoding specifies the segment index, models the relationships between segments, and aims to improve extrapolation capabilities via relative positional encoding. Theoretical analysis shows this disentanglement of positional information makes learning more effective. The empirical results also show that our BiPE has superior length extrapolation capabilities across a wide range of tasks in diverse text modalities.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/42 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2019 Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics: Human Language Technologies, Volume 1 (Long and Short Papers), pp. 4171-4186, June 2019b.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.09)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

However, due to high fine-tuning costs, scarcity of long texts, and catastrophic values introduced by new token positions, current extended context windows are limited to around 128k tokens. This paper introduces LongRoPE that, for the first time, extends the context window of pre-trained LLMs to an impressive 2048k tokens, with up to only 1k fine-tuning steps at within 256k training lengths, while maintaining performance at the original short context window. This is achieved by three key innovations: (i) we identify and exploit two forms of non-uniformities in positional interpolation through an efficient search, providing a better initialization for fine-tuning and enabling an 8x extension in non-fine-tuning scenarios; (ii) we introduce a progressive extension strategy that first fine-tunes a 256k length LLM and then conducts a second positional interpolation on the fine-tuned extended LLM to achieve a 2048k context window; (iii) we readjust LongRoPE on 8k length to recover the short context window performance. Extensive experiments on LLaMA2 and Mistral across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Models extended via LongRoPE retain the original architecture with minor modifications to the positional embedding, and can reuse most pre-existing optimizations.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/32 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 33: 7537-7547, 2020.

Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9591  (*Influential: 1898*)\n\n#### 2. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Anurag Ajay, Seung-Jun Han, Yilun Du, Shaung Li, Abhishek Gupta, T.

Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks and enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. Adaptive Normalization for Non-stationary Time Series Forecasting: A Temporal Slice Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhiding Liu, Mingyue Cheng, Zhi Li, Zhenya Huang, Qi Liu, Yanhu Xie, Enhong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel slice-level adaptive normalization scheme, referred to SAN, is proposed, which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization and could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning models have progressively advanced time series forecasting due to their powerful capacity in capturing sequence dependence. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to make accurate predictions due to the existence of non-stationarity in real-world data, denoting the data distribution rapidly changes over time. To mitigate such a dilemma, several efforts have been conducted by reducing the non-stationarity with normalization operation. However, these methods typically overlook the distribution discrepancy between the input series and the horizon series, and assume that all time points within the same instance share the same statistical properties, which is too ideal and may lead to suboptimal relative improvements. To this end, we propose a novel slice-level adaptive normalization, referred to SAN , which is a novel scheme for empowering time series forecasting with more flexible normalization and denormalization. SAN includes two crucial designs. First, SAN tries to eliminate the non-stationarity of time series in units of a local temporal slice (i.e., sub-series) rather than a global instance. Second, SAN employs a slight network module to independently model the evolving trends of statistical properties of raw time series. Consequently, SAN could serve as a general model-agnostic plugin and better alleviate the impact of the non-stationary nature of time series data. We instantiate the proposed SAN on four widely used forecasting models and test their prediction results on benchmark datasets to evaluate its effectiveness. Also, we report some insightful findings to deeply analyze and understand our proposed SAN.

GradNorm: Gradient Normalization for Adaptive Loss Balancing in Deep Multitask Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Zhao Chen, Vijay Badrinarayanan, Chen-Yu Lee, Andrew Rabinovich*\n\n**TL;DR:** A gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes is presented, showing that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep multitask networks, in which one neural network produces multiple predictive outputs, can offer better speed and performance than their single-task counterparts but are challenging to train properly. We present a gradient normalization (GradNorm) algorithm that automatically balances training in deep multitask models by dynamically tuning gradient magnitudes. We show that for various network architectures, for both regression and classification tasks, and on both synthetic and real datasets, GradNorm improves accuracy and reduces overfitting across multiple tasks when compared to single-task networks, static baselines, and other adaptive multitask loss balancing techniques. GradNorm also matches or surpasses the performance of exhaustive grid search methods, despite only involving a single asymmetry hyperparameter $\\alpha$. Thus, what was once a tedious search process that incurred exponentially more compute for each task added can now be accomplished within a few training runs, irrespective of the number of tasks. Ultimately, we will demonstrate that gradient manipulation affords us great control over the training dynamics of multitask networks and may be one of the keys to unlocking the potential of multitask learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 1089  (*Influential: 144*)\n\n#### 6.

The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 10680  (*Influential: 2358*)\n\n#### 7. Neural Relational Inference with Fast Modular Meta-learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Ferran Alet, Erica Weng, Tomas Lozano-Perez, L. Kaelbling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-learns a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed in the large search space of graph neural network compositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for many dynamical systems consisting of entities and relations. Although most GNN applications assume a single type of entity and relation, many situations involve multiple types of interactions. Relational inference is the problem of inferring these interactions and learning the dynamics from observational data. We frame relational inference as a modular meta-learning problem, where neural modules are trained to be composed in different ways to solve many tasks. This meta-learning framework allows us to implicitly encode time invariance and infer relations in context of one another rather than independently, which increases inference capacity. Framing inference as the inner-loop optimization of meta-learning leads to a model-based approach that is more data-efficient and capable of estimating the state of entities that we do not observe directly, but whose existence can be inferred from their effect on observed entities. To address the large search space of graph neural network compositions, we meta-learn a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 8. Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Nathan J. Hu, E. Mitchell, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*David Donahue, Vladislav Lialin, Anna Rumshisky*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become increasingly popular over the past\ntwo years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the\nlevel of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer\nmodels do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is\nwidely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce\nhierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the\nU-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of\nnatural images.

Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions\nof intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and\nbetter generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the\neffectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a\nstep further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that\nthe success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find\nthat the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward\nnormalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore,\nwe find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase\nthe risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a\nsimple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain\noutperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art\nperformance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem,\nwe propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by\nreplacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments\nshow that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of\neight datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-16T11:00:16Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. MoNoise: Modeling Noise Using a Modular Normalization System\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Rob van der Goot, Gertjan van Noord*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose MoNoise: a normalization model focused on generalizability and\nefficiency, it aims at being easily reusable and adaptable. Normalization is\nthe task of translating texts from a non- canonical domain to a more canonical\ndomain, in our case: from social media data to standard language. Our proposed\nmodel is based on a modular candidate generation in which each module is\nresponsible for a different type of normalization action. The most important\ngeneration modules are a spelling correction system and a word embeddings\nmodule. Depending on the definition of the normalization task, a static lookup\nlist can be crucial for performance. We train a random forest classifier to\nrank the candidates, which generalizes well to all different types of\nnormaliza- tion actions. Most features for the ranking originate from the\ngeneration modules; besides these features, N-gram features prove to be an\nimportant source of information. We show that MoNoise beats the\nstate-of-the-art on different normalization benchmarks for English and Dutch,\nwhich all define the task of normalization slightly different.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z  (*Updated: 2017-10-10T09:41:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Review on Semi-Supervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Yusen Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Relation extraction (RE) plays an important role in extracting knowledge from\nunstructured text but requires a large amount of labeled corpus. To reduce the\nexpensive annotation efforts, semisupervised learning aims to leverage both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we review and compare three typical\nmethods in semi-supervised RE with deep learning or meta-learning:\nself-ensembling, which forces consistent under perturbations but may confront\ninsufficient supervision; self-training, which iteratively generates pseudo\nlabels and retrain itself with the enlarged labeled set; dual learning, which\nleverages a primal task and a dual task to give mutual feedback.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive normalization*\n\n*Jun-Yan Zhu, Ting-Chun Wang, Ming-Yu Liu, Taesung Park*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose spatially-adaptive normalization, a simple but effective layer for synthesizing photorealistic images given an input semantic layout. Previous methods directly feed the semantic layout as input to the deep network, which is then processed through stacks of convolution, normalization, and nonlinearity layers. We show that this is suboptimal as the normalization layers tend to ``wash away'' semantic information. To address the issue, we propose using the input layout for modulating the activations in normalization layers through a spatially-adaptive, learned transformation. Experiments on several challenging datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method over existing approaches, regarding both visual fidelity and alignment with input layouts. Finally, our model allows user control over both semantic and style.

The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

Meta-Learning Update Rules for Unsupervised Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Luke Metz, Brian Cheung, Niru Maheswaranathan*\n\n**Abstract:** A major goal of unsupervised learning is to discover data representations\nthat are useful for subsequent tasks, without access to supervised labels\nduring training. Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective,\nsuch as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that\nrepresentations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In\nthis work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by\nmeta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations\nuseful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification\nperformance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update\nrule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we\nconstrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated,\nneuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural\nnetwork architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the\nmeta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms\nexisting unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the\nmeta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with\ndifferent widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on\ndata with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image\ndatasets to a text task.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2019-5\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 6. Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Janarthanan Rajendran, Eric Jang, Alex Irpan*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning algorithms aim to learn two components: a model that predicts targets for a task, and a base learner that quickly updates that model when given examples from a new task. This additional level of learning can be powerful, but it also creates another potential source for overfitting, since we can now overfit in either the model or the base learner. We describe both of these forms of metalearning overfitting, and demonstrate that they appear experimentally in common meta-learning benchmarks. We then use an information-theoretic framework to discuss meta-augmentation, a way to add randomness that discourages the base learner and model from learning trivial solutions that do not generalize to new tasks. We demonstrate that meta-augmentation produces large complementary benefits to recently proposed meta-regularization techniques.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating hierarchical processing, adaptive normalization, and meta-learning strategies, here are some key insights and relevant techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-demonstrated in models like the \"H-Transformer-1D\" which uses hierarchical attention to capture multi-scale dependencies effectively.\n- Hierarchical multi-scale processing, as seen in the MHLTransformer, combines local and global dependencies, which is crucial for understanding complex sequences.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization\n- The HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm model introduces hierarchical and adaptive normalization to RMSNorm, enhancing efficiency and scalability. This approach can be integrated with hierarchical processing to manage computational complexity better.\n- Adaptive normalization can be particularly beneficial when combined with hierarchical processing, as it allows for dynamic adjustment of normalization parameters based on the input complexity.\n\n## Meta-Learning Strategies\n- Meta-learning can be used to dynamically adjust attention weights and normalization parameters, enhancing adaptability and robustness. Models like \"OmniNet\" use meta-learning within Transformers for dynamic attention adjustment, which can be applied to hierarchical models.\n- Self-Supervised Meta-Learning (SSML) frameworks, as described in the context of adaptive control, can be adapted for language models. SSML pretrains models to predict future data points or disturbances in a self-supervised manner, which can be beneficial for language models to adapt to new tasks or environments.\n\n## Integration and Efficiency\n- Combining hierarchical processing with adaptive normalization and meta-learning can address the limitations of both parent models. This integration can reduce computational complexity while maintaining efficiency across varying input complexities.\n- Techniques like \"Infini-Attention\" can be used to enable efficient processing of infinitely long sequences, which aligns well with the hierarchical and adaptive normalization approaches.\n\n## Efficient Memory Management\n- Efficient memory management techniques such as \"Dynamic Context Pruning\" can be leveraged to optimize resource utilization and scalability. This involves compressing less critical information to manage memory efficiently.\n\n## Recent Advancements\n- Recent studies on meta-learning-based adaptive control, such as the SSML-AC framework, provide insights into how full DNNs can be adapted online with stability guarantees. This can be translated to language models to enhance their adaptability and robustness.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention and Processing**: Combine hierarchical attention mechanisms like those in H-Transformer-1D with multi-scale processing to capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n2. **Adaptive Normalization**: Implement hierarchical and adaptive normalization techniques to enhance efficiency and scalability, as seen in HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm.\n3. **Meta-Learning**: Integrate meta-learning strategies to dynamically adjust attention weights and normalization parameters.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA), is proposed, introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Zamba is trained on 1T tokens from openly available datasets and is the best non-transformer model at this scale. Zamba pioneers a unique architecture combining a Mamba backbone with a single shared attention module, thus obtaining the benefits of attention at minimal parameter cost. Due to its architecture, Zamba is significantly faster at inference than comparable transformer models and requires substantially less memory for generation of long sequences. Zamba is pretrained in two phases: the first phase is based on existing web datasets, while the second one consists of annealing the model over high-quality instruct and synthetic datasets, and is characterized by a rapid learning rate decay. We open-source the weights and all checkpoints for Zamba, through both phase 1 and annealing phases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/31 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.00027.

Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Contrastive Token-Wise Meta-Learning for Unseen Performer Visual Temporal-Aligned Translation\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Lin Li, Tao Jin, Xize Cheng, Yejin Wang, Wang Lin, Rongjie Huang, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel generalizable framework named C ontrastive To ken-Wise M eta-l earning (CtoML), which strives to transfer recognition skills to unseen performers is developed, and two complementary global and local contrastive losses are developed to maintain inter-class relationships and promote domain-independence.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual temporal-aligned translation aims to transform the visual sequence into natural words, including important applicable tasks such as lipreading and fingerspelling recognition. However, various performance habits of specific words by different speakers or signers can lead to visual ambiguity, which has become a major obstacle to the development of current methods. Considering the constraints above, the generalization ability of the translation system is supposed to be further explored through the evaluation results on unseen per-formers. In this paper, we develop a novel generalizable framework named C ontrastive To ken-Wise M eta-l earning (CtoML), which strives to transfer recognition skills to unseen performers. To the best of our knowledge, employing meta-learning methods directly in the image domain poses two main challenges, and we propose corresponding strategies. First, sequence prediction in visual temporal-aligned translation, which aims to generate multiple words autoregressively, is different from the vanilla classification. Thus, we devise the token-wise diversity-aware weights for the meta-train stage, which encourages the model to make efforts on those ambiguously recognized tokens. Second, considering the consistency of word-visual prototypes across different domains, we develop two complementary global and local contrastive losses to maintain inter-class relationships and promote domain-independence. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used lipreading dataset GRID and the fingerspelling dataset ChicagoF-SWild, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed CtoML over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Meta-Learning with Neural Bandit Scheduler\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yunzhe Qi, Yikun Ban, Tianxin Wei, Jiaru Zou, Huaxiu Yao, Jingrui He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task scheduling framework under Contextual Bandits settings, named BASS, which directly optimizes the task scheduling strategy based on the status of the meta-model is proposed, which can help tackle the challenge of limited knowledge about the task distribution during the early stage of meta-training.\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning has been proven an effective learning paradigm for training machine learning models with good generalization ability. Apart from the common practice of uniformly sampling the meta-training tasks, existing methods working on task scheduling strategies are mainly based on pre-defined sampling protocols or the assumed task-model correlations, and greedily make scheduling decisions, which can lead to sub-optimal performance bottlenecks of the meta-model. In this paper, we propose a novel task scheduling framework under Contextual Bandits settings, named BASS, which directly optimizes the task scheduling strategy based on the status of the meta-model. By balancing the exploitation and exploration in meta-learning task scheduling, BASS can help tackle the challenge of limited knowledge about the task distribution during the early stage of meta-training, while simultaneously exploring potential benefits for forthcoming meta-training iterations through an adaptive exploration strategy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Meta-in-context learning in large language models\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Zeynep Akata, M. Botvinick, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in- context learning itself, and this phenomenon is coined meta-in- Context learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have shown tremendous performance in a variety of tasks. In-context learning -- the ability to improve at a task after being provided with a number of demonstrations -- is seen as one of the main contributors to their success. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in-context learning itself. We coin this phenomenon meta-in-context learning. Looking at two idealized domains, a one-dimensional regression task and a two-armed bandit task, we show that meta-in-context learning adaptively reshapes a large language model's priors over expected tasks. Furthermore, we find that meta-in-context learning modifies the in-context learning strategies of such models. Finally, we extend our approach to a benchmark of real-world regression problems where we observe competitive performance to traditional learning algorithms.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1372  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 6. Identification of Nonlinear Latent Hierarchical Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*Lingjing Kong, Biwei Huang, Feng Xie, E. Xing, Yuejie Chi, Kun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops an identification criterion in the form of novel identifiability guarantees for an elementary latent variable model and shows that both causal structures and latent variables of the hierarchical model can be identified asymptotically by explicitly constructing an estimation procedure.\n\n**Abstract:** Identifying latent variables and causal structures from observational data is essential to many real-world applications involving biological data, medical data, and unstructured data such as images and languages. However, this task can be highly challenging, especially when observed variables are generated by causally related latent variables and the relationships are nonlinear. In this work, we investigate the identification problem for nonlinear latent hierarchical causal models in which observed variables are generated by a set of causally related latent variables, and some latent variables may not have observed children. We show that the identifiability of causal structures and latent variables (up to invertible transformations) can be achieved under mild assumptions: on causal structures, we allow for multiple paths between any pair of variables in the graph, which relaxes latent tree assumptions in prior work; on structural functions, we permit general nonlinearity and multi-dimensional continuous variables, alleviating existing work's parametric assumptions. Specifically, we first develop an identification criterion in the form of novel identifiability guarantees for an elementary latent variable model. Leveraging this criterion, we show that both causal structures and latent variables of the hierarchical model can be identified asymptotically by explicitly constructing an estimation procedure. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish identifiability guarantees for both causal structures and latent variables in nonlinear latent hierarchical models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. LIMIT: Language Identification, Misidentification, and Translation using Hierarchical Models in 350+ Languages\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*M.

Language identification is a well-studied problem, sometimes even considered solved; in reality, most of the world's 7000 languages are not supported by current systems. This lack of representation affects large-scale data mining efforts and further exacerbates data shortage for low-resource languages. We take a step towards tackling the data bottleneck by compiling a corpus of over 50K parallel children's stories in 350+ languages and dialects, and the computation bottleneck by building lightweight hierarchical models for language identification. Our data can serve as benchmark data for language identification of short texts and for understudied translation directions such as those between Indian or African languages. Our proposed method, Hierarchical LIMIT, uses limited computation to expand coverage into excluded languages while maintaining prediction quality.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Variational Inference with Locally Enhanced Bounds for Hierarchical Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*Tomas Geffner, Justin Domke*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of variational bounds for hierarchical models, based on the application of tightening methods separately for each group of local random variables, and shows that this approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased gradients, and fully leverages the power of methods that build tighter lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchical models represent a challenging setting for inference algorithms. MCMC methods struggle to scale to large models with many local variables and observations, and variational inference (VI) may fail to provide accurate approximations due to the use of simple variational families. Some variational methods (e.g. importance weighted VI) integrate Monte Carlo methods to give better accuracy, but these tend to be unsuitable for hierarchical models, as they do not allow for subsampling and their performance tends to degrade for high dimensional models. We propose a new family of variational bounds for hierarchical models, based on the application of tightening methods (e.g. importance weighting) separately for each group of local random variables. We show that our approach naturally allows the use of subsampling to get unbiased gradients, and that it fully leverages the power of methods that build tighter lower bounds by applying them independently in lower dimensional spaces, leading to better results and more accurate posterior approximations than relevant baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Learning to Ignore: Long Document Coreference with Bounded Memory Neural\n  Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management*\n\n*Shubham Toshniwal, Sam Wiseman, Allyson Ettinger, Karen Livescu, Kevin Gimpel*\n\n**Abstract:** Long document coreference resolution remains a challenging task due to the\nlarge memory and runtime requirements of current models. Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. The Impact of Hyperparameters on Large Language Model Inference\n  Performance: An Evaluation of vLLM and HuggingFace Pipelines\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management*\n\n*Matias Martinez*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent surge of open-source large language models (LLMs) enables\ndevelopers to create AI-based solutions while maintaining control over aspects\nsuch as privacy and compliance, thereby providing governance and ownership of\nthe model deployment process. To utilize these LLMs, inference engines are\nneeded. These engines load the model's weights onto available resources, such\nas GPUs, and process queries to generate responses. The speed of inference, or\nperformance, of the LLM, is critical for real-time applications, as it computes\nmillions or billions of floating point operations per inference. Recently,\nadvanced inference engines such as vLLM have emerged, incorporating novel\nmechanisms such as efficient memory management to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance. In this paper, we analyze the performance, particularly the\nthroughput (tokens generated per unit of time), of 20 LLMs using two inference\nlibraries: vLLM and HuggingFace's pipelines. We investigate how various\nhyperparameters, which developers must configure, influence inference\nperformance. Our results reveal that throughput landscapes are irregular, with\ndistinct peaks, highlighting the importance of hyperparameter optimization to\nachieve maximum performance. We also show that applying hyperparameter\noptimization when upgrading or downgrading the GPU model used for inference can\nimprove throughput from HuggingFace pipelines by an average of 9.16% and 13.7%,\nrespectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-02T06:56:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-02T06:56:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Which Kind Is Better in Open-domain Multi-turn Dialog,Hierarchical or\n  Non-hierarchical Models? An Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*Tian Lan, Xian-Ling Mao, Wei Wei, Heyan Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** Currently, open-domain generative dialog systems have attracted considerable\nattention in academia and industry. Despite the success of single-turn dialog\ngeneration, multi-turn dialog generation is still a big challenge. So far,\nthere are two kinds of models for open-domain multi-turn dialog generation:\nhierarchical and non-hierarchical models. Recently, some works have shown that\nthe hierarchical models are better than non-hierarchical models under their\nexperimental settings; meanwhile, some works also demonstrate the opposite\nconclusion. Due to the lack of adequate comparisons, it's not clear which kind\nof models are better in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation. Thus, in this\npaper, we will measure systematically nearly all representative hierarchical\nand non-hierarchical models over the same experimental settings to check which\nkind is better. Through extensive experiments, we have the following three\nimportant conclusions: (1) Nearly all hierarchical models are worse than\nnon-hierarchical models in open-domain multi-turn dialog generation, except for\nthe HRAN model. Through further analysis, the excellent performance of HRAN\nmainly depends on its word-level attention mechanism; (2) The performance of\nother hierarchical models will also obtain a great improvement if integrating\nthe word-level attention mechanism into these models. The modified hierarchical\nmodels even significantly outperform the non-hierarchical models; (3) The\nreason why the word-level attention mechanism is so powerful for hierarchical\nmodels is because it can leverage context information more effectively,\nespecially the fine-grained information. Besides, we have implemented all of\nthe models and already released the codes.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-07T02:54:55Z  (*Updated: 2020-08-07T02:54:55Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. A Hierarchical Model of Reviews for Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*Sebastian Ruder, Parsa Ghaffari, John G. Breslin*\n\n**Abstract:** Opinion mining from customer reviews has become pervasive in recent years.\nSentences in reviews, however, are usually classified independently, even\nthough they form part of a review's argumentative structure. Intuitively,\nsentences in a review build and elaborate upon each other; knowledge of the\nreview structure and sentential context should thus inform the classification\nof each sentence. We demonstrate this hypothesis for the task of aspect-based\nsentiment analysis by modeling the interdependencies of sentences in a review\nwith a hierarchical bidirectional LSTM. We show that the hierarchical model\noutperforms two non-hierarchical baselines, obtains results competitive with\nthe state-of-the-art, and outperforms the state-of-the-art on five\nmultilingual, multi-domain datasets without any hand-engineered features or\nexternal resources.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-09T11:16:15Z  (*Updated: 2016-09-09T11:16:15Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Structured Exploration Strategies\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yuxuan Liu, Russell Mendonca, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Abhishek Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Exploration is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Many\nof the current exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives,\nsuch as information gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many\npractical applications of RL involve learning more than a single task, and\nprior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new\ntasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how\nto explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based\nfast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise\n(MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior\nexperience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent\nexploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy,\nproducing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are\nmore effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more\neffective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL\nmethods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic\nexploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks:\nlocomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and\nobject manipulation.\n\n**Conference:** meta-reinforcement-learning-of-structured-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning Fast Adaptation with Meta Strategy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yunfei Bai, Sehoon Ha, Erwin Coumans, Wenhao Yu, Jie Tan*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability to walk in new scenarios is a key milestone on the path toward real-world applications of legged robots. In this work, we introduce Meta Strategy Optimization, a meta-learning algorithm for training policies with latent variable inputs that can quickly adapt to new scenarios with a handful of trials in the target environment. The key idea behind MSO is to expose the same adaptation process, Strategy Optimization (SO), to both the training and testing phases. This allows MSO to effectively learn locomotion skills as well as a latent space that is suitable for fast adaptation. We evaluate our method on a real quadruped robot and demonstrate successful adaptation in various scenarios, including sim-to-real transfer, walking with a weakened motor, or climbing up a slope. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the generalization capability of the trained policy in simulated environments. Both real and simulated experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods in adaptation to novel tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Memory Management for Deep Neural Net Inference\n\n*From Search Query: efficient memory management*\n\n*Yury Pisarchyk, Juhyun Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** While deep neural net inference was considered a task for servers only, latest advances in technology allow the task of inference to be moved to mobile and embedded devices, desired for various reasons ranging from latency to privacy. These devices are not only limited by their compute power and battery, but also by their inferior physical memory and cache, and thus, an efficient memory manager becomes a crucial component for deep neural net inference at the edge. We explore various strategies to smartly share memory buffers among intermediate tensors in deep neural nets. Employing these can result in up to 11% smaller memory footprint than the state of the art.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical models*\n\n*Henryk Michalewski, Christian Szegedy, Yuhuai Wu, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Szymon Tworkowski, Piotr Nawrot*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-transformers-are-more-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Bayesian optimization employs the Bayesian\ntechnique of setting a prior over the objective function and combining it with\nevidence to get a posterior function. This permits a utility-based selection of\nthe next observation to make on the objective function, which must take into\naccount both exploration (sampling from areas of high uncertainty) and\nexploitation (sampling areas likely to offer improvement over the current best\nobservation). We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization,\nwith experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical\nreinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian\noptimization based on our experiences.\n\n**Published:** 2010-12-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using meta-learning strategies, efficient memory management, and hierarchical models, here are some key insights and techniques that can be leveraged:\n\n## Meta-Learning Strategies\n\n### Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)\nMAML is a powerful meta-learning approach that can be integrated into language models to enhance their adaptability. It involves finding a good initialization for model parameters that can be quickly fine-tuned for new tasks with minimal data.

This approach can be combined with adaptive normalization to manage computational complexity and improve efficiency - **Analysis of Model**.\n\n### Task-Specific Adapters\nUsing task-specific adapters in hierarchical models allows for task-specific fine-tuning without disrupting the shared base network. This approach is computationally efficient and can extend models to new tasks without retraining the entire system.\n\n### Adaptive Normalization\nTechniques like HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm introduce hierarchical and adaptive normalization, which can enhance the efficiency and scalability of language models. This can be particularly effective when combined with meta-learning strategies to dynamically adjust normalization parameters - **Analysis of Model**.\n\n## Adaptive Computation\n\n### OmniNet\nOmniNet uses meta-learning within Transformers for dynamic attention adjustment, which can be applied to hierarchical models. This approach allows the model to adaptively focus on different parts of the input data depending on the task, enhancing adaptability and robustness - **Analysis of Model**.\n\n### Multi-Task Attention Mechanisms\nMulti-task attention mechanisms can dynamically determine which parts of the shared representation are most relevant for each task.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.80)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/47 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nOur agent achieves performance competitive with the specialized model proposed to solve each task.

The agent is placed in a neighborhood, and must navigate to as many goals as it can within a fixed time. The agent receives its current state and goal as visual inputs (Google StreetView images) and must learn about the neighborhood in early tasks within an episode, in order to navigate efficiently later. Ritter et al. designed a specialized Episodic Planning Network (EPN) to solve these tasks. HCAM-despite its more general purpose architecture-can achieve comparable performance to EPN (although HCAM is somewhat slower to reach this level of performance). Ritter et al. showed that EPN achieves near-optimal planning in later parts of each episode, and therefore HCAM must be planning close to optimally to match EPN's performance. Strong baselines perform much worse. Merlin [60]-a strong agent with a learned episodic key-value memory and auxiliary unsupervised training-only achieves around half the performance of HCAM and EPN. TrXL is also less effective. This highlights the value of more sophisticated memory architectures, and in particular emphasizes the value of sequences stored in memory, rather than single vectors: EPN stores transitions (sequences of length 2) and HCAM stores longer sequences, while Merlin has only single vector values for each key (as does $\\operatorname{TrXL}$ ). ## 4 Discussion\n\nIn this paper we have proposed the Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory. HCAM allows agents to attend in detail to past events without attending to irrelevant intervening information. Thus, HCAM effectively implements a form of \"mental time-travel\" [55]. Our main insight is that this ability can be achieved using a hierarchically structured memory that sparsely distributes detailed attention. Specifically, recall uses attention over memory chunk summaries to allocate more detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. We see this as a potentially important insight, because both mental time travel [52] and hierarchical structure [16] are essential to the power of human memory. Furthermore, recent work has suggested that human memory behaves more like a \"quantum wave function\" distribution over several past events [37], which matches our approach of a distribution over the top- $k$ relevant chunks. HCAM incorporates a number of important features of human memory. Correspondingly, we showed that agents with HCAM succeed at a wide range of environments and tasks that humans depend on memory to solve. HCAM allows agents to remember sequential events, such as a ballet, in detail. HCAM allows agents to rapidly learn to navigate near-optimally in a new neighborhood by planning over previous paths; to perform transitive inferences; and to maintain object permanence, despite delays, occlusion and looking away. HCAM allows agents to effectively learn new words from a single exposure, and maintain that knowledge across distractor tasks. The agents can even extrapolate far beyond the training distribution to recall words after subsequent learning episodes without ever being trained to do so-better memory systems can help with the challenge of bridging from meta-learning to continual learning, which is receiving increasing interest [13, 17, 49, 5, 41]. The tasks we considered are challenging because they rely on flexible use of memory. The agent did not know in advance which paths to remember in One-Shot StreetLearn, or which dancer would\nbe chosen in Ballet. Furthermore, we trained the agent simultaneously on procedurally generated episodes where task features varied-e.g. the agent did not know how many distractor phases would appear in an episode, or the length of delays, so it could not rely on a fixed policy that recalls information after a fixed time. HCAM might be especially useful in these difficult, variable settings. HCAM is robust to hyperparameters such as chunk size (App. D.4) and the number $k$ of memories selected at each layer and step (App.D.5_ it is even able to solve many tasks with $k=1$. It also outperforms TrXL models that are either twice as wide or twice as deep, and correspondingly have many more parameters and, in the deeper case, make many more attention computations (App.D.8). Our comparisons to other approaches (Sec. 3.4 show that our approach is competitive with state of the art, problem-specific memory architectures, and outperforms strong baselines like Merlin and Universal Transformers. Finally, in hyperparameter sweeps suggested by our reviewers to improve TrXL's performance, we found that HCAM was consistently more robust to hyperparameter variation (App.D.11). These observations suggest that our results should be relatively generalizable. Self-supervised learning As in prior memory work [60, 14, 19] we found that self-supervised learning was necessary to train the agent to store all task-relevant information in memory. Training the agent to reconstruct its input observations as outputs was sufficient in the tasks we explored, but more sophisticated forms of auxiliary learning [23, 3] might be useful in other settings. Memory in RL vs. supervised settings Our work has focused on improving the memory of a situated RL agent. Compared to supervised settings such as language modelling, where a vanilla transformer can achieve very impressive performance [48, 4], RL poses unique challenges to memory architectures. First, sparse rewards present a more impoverished learning signal than settings that provide detailed errors for each output. The ability of HCAM to restore a memory in detail may help ameliorate this problem. Second, the multimodal (language + vision) stimuli experienced by our agent contains much more information per step than the word-pieces alone that a language model experiences, and therefore our setting may place more demands on the memory architecture. Finally, our tasks require access to detailed, structural aspects of past memories, while many existing NLP tasks do not depend significantly on structure - for example, Pham et al. [45] show that BERT ignores word order when solving many language understanding benchmarks, and produces equivalent outputs for shuffled inputs. Detailed memory will be most beneficial in settings in which the sequential structure of the past is important. Nonetheless, we do not rule out possible applications of HCAM in supervised settings, such as language processing [48, 4], video understanding [53], or multimodal perception [24]. HCAM would likely be most beneficial in tasks that strongly rely on long-term context and structure, e.g. the full-length version of NarrativeQA [29]. Because videos often contain hierarchically-structured events, video models might especially benefit from HCAM-style attention. More broadly, the greater efficiency of sparse, hierarchical attention might allow detailed memory even in settings with limited computational resources, such as embedded systems. Episodic memories Nematzadeh et al. [42] suggested endowing transformers with external episodic memories. Several recent papers have proposed systems that can be interpreted as episodic memories from this perspective, specifically looking up related contexts from the training corpus using either nearest neighbors [26], or attention [62]. However, these approaches have generally only used this type of external memory to predict outputs, rather than allowing the model to perform further computations over the memories it recalls, as in HCAM. Thus, these memories would be inadequate for most RL tasks, which require planning or reasoning with memories. Various works have proposed other types of external/episodic memory, both in RL specifically [e.g. 60, 21, 14] and in deep learning more broadly [e.g. 50, 15]. These approaches have generally not stored memories with the hierarchical summary-chunk structure of HCAM. Ritter et al. [49] proposed an episodic memory for navigation tasks that stores state transitions; this architecture can be seen as a step towards our approach of storing sequences as chunks. Indeed, in the challenging city navigation domain that Ritter et al. explored, we showed that HCAM achieves comparable performance to their EPN architecture, despite HCAM being much more general. Furthermore, both HCAM and EPN substantially outperform Merlin [60], a strong baseline that learns to store vector memories, rather than the rich representations of sequences stored by HCAM (or transitions stored by EPN). This highlights the value of rich, sequential memories. We suggest that episodic memories could benefit from moving beyond the idea of keys and values as single vectors. It can be useful to store more general structures-such as a time-sequence of states-as a single \"value\" in memory. One benefit of episodic memory is that memory replay can support learning [30, 38], in particular by ameliorating catastrophic interference. It would therefore be interesting to explore whether HCAM's memory could be used for training. For example, could memory summaries be used to locate similar or contrasting memories that should be interleaved together [39] to improve continual learning? Transformer memories Many recent works have attempted to improve the computational efficiency of transformer attention over long sequences [e.g. 28, 58]. However, these approaches often perform poorly at even moderately long tasks [54]. Similarly, we found that on tasks like Ballet or One-Shot StreetLearn, Transformer-XL can perform suboptimally even when the entire task fits within a single, relatively short attention window. However, there could potentially be complementary benefits to combining approaches to obtain even more effective attention with hierarchical memory, which should be investigated in future work. In particular, some recent work has proposed a simple inductive bias which allows Transformers to benefit from evaluation lengths much longer than they were trained on [46]-while this strategy would likely not help with recalling specific instances in detail, it might be complementary to an approach like ours. Other works have used a hierarchy of transformers with different timescales for supervised tasks [34, 6461,32 , for example encoding sentences with one transformer, and then using these embeddings as higher-level tokens. This approach improves performance on tasks like document summarization, thus supporting the value of hierarchy. Luong et al. [36] also showed benefits of both local and global attention computation in LSTM-based models. However, we are not aware of prior transformers in which the coarse computations are used to select chunks for more detailed computation, as in HCAM (although recent work has demonstrated top- $k$ patch selection in CNNs [8]); nor are we aware of prior works that have demonstrated their approaches in RL, or beyond a single task domain. Memory and adaptation One major benefit of memory is that a model can flexibly use its memories in a goal- or context-dependent way in order to adapt to new tasks [55, 52, 30]. Adult humans use our recall of rich, contextual memories in order to generalize effectively [52, 43]. While our tasks required some forms of goal-dependent memory use-e.g. combining old paths to plan new ones-it would be interesting to evaluate more drastic forms of adaptation. Recent work shows that transforming prior task representations allows zero-shot adaptation to substantially altered tasks [31]. HCAM could potentially learn to transform and combine memories of prior tasks in order to adapt to radically different settings. Exploring these possibilities offers an exciting future direction. Limitations \\& future directions While we see our contribution as a step towards more effective mental time-travel for agent memory, many aspects could be further improved. Our implementation requires the ability to keep each previous step in (hardware) memory, even if the chunk containing that step is irrelevant. This approach would be challenging to scale to the entire lifetime of episodic memory that humans retain. Nonetheless, storing the past is feasible up to tens of thousands of steps on current accelerators. This could be extended further by using efficient $k \\mathrm{NN}$ implementations, which have recently been used to perform $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup over an entire language dataset [26]. The challenge of scaling to longer-term memory would be helped by deciding what to store, as in some episodic memory models [15], soft forgetting of rarely retrieved memories, and similar mechanisms. However, such mechanisms are simultaneously limiting, in that the model may be unable to recall knowledge that was not obviously useful at the time of encoding. Over longer timescales, HCAM might also benefit from including more layers of hierarchy-grouping memory chunks into higher-order chunks recursively to achieve logarithmic complexity for recall. Even over moderate timescales, more intelligent segmentation of memory into chunks would potentially be beneficial-human encoding and recall depends upon complex strategies for event segmentation [63, 51, 6, 35, 7]. HCAM might also benefit from improved chunk summaries; mean-pooling over the chunk is a relatively na\u00efve approach to summarization, so learning a compression mechanism might be beneficial [47]. These possibilities provide exciting directions for future work. Conclusions We have proposed a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory for RL agents. This architecture allows agents to recall their most relevant memories in detail, and to reason over those memories to achieve new goals. This approach outperforms (or matches the optimal performance of) a wide variety of baselines, across a wide variety of task domains. It allows agents to remember where objects were hidden, and to efficiently learn to navigate in a new neighborhood by planning from memory. It allows agents to recall words they have learned despite distracting intervening tasks, and even across episodes. These abilities to learn, adapt, and maintain new knowledge are critical to intelligent behavior, especially as the field progresses towards more complex environments. We\nhope that our work will motivate further exploration of hierarchically structured memories, in RL and beyond. Hierarchical memory may have many benefits for learning, reasoning, adaptation, and intermediate- or long-term recall. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nWe would like to acknowledge Adam Santoro, Emilio Parisotto, Jay McClelland, David Raposo, Wilka Carvalho, Tim Scholtes, Tamara von Glehn, S\u00e9bastien Racani\u00e8re, and the anonymous reviewers for helpful comments and suggestions. ## References\n\n[1] Renee Baillargeon.

Score: 0.67)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation. The code and models are available at https://github.com/Caiyun-AI/DCFormer.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/38 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2210.05144, 2022.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.34)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptation*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 181  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 2. Lifelong Sequence Generation with Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptation*\n\n*Chengwei Qin, Shafiq R. Joty, Chen Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA) is proposed, which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Lifelong sequence generation (LSG), a problem in continual learning, aims to continually train a model on a sequence of generation tasks to learn constantly emerging new generation patterns while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. DADA: Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation of Linguistic Rules\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptation*\n\n*Yanchen Liu, William B. Held, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes DADA (Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation), a modular approach to imbue SAE-trained models with multi-dialectal robustness by composing adapters which handle specific linguistic features.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing large language models (LLMs) that mainly focus on Standard American English (SAE) often lead to significantly worse performance when being applied to other English dialects. While existing mitigations tackle discrepancies for individual target dialects, they assume access to high-accuracy dialect identification systems. The boundaries between dialects are inherently flexible, making it difficult to categorize language into discrete predefined categories. In this paper, we propose DADA (Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation), a modular approach to imbue SAE-trained models with multi-dialectal robustness by composing adapters which handle specific linguistic features. The compositional architecture of DADA allows for both targeted adaptation to specific dialect variants and simultaneous adaptation to various dialects. We show that DADA is effective for both single task and instruction finetuned language models, offering an extensible and interpretable framework for adapting existing LLMs to different English dialects.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Hovy*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a hierarchical attention network for document classification. Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin. Visualization of the attention layers illustrates that the model selects qualitatively informative words and sentences.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 4301  (*Influential: 554*)\n\n#### 5.

Kautz, Pavlo Molchanov*\n\n**TL;DR:** The newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs and can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them.\n\n**Abstract:** We design a new family of hybrid CNN-ViT neural networks, named FasterViT, with a focus on high image throughput for computer vision (CV) applications. FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

HAHE: Hierarchical Attention for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs in Global and Local Level\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Haoran Luo, E. Haihong, Yuhao Yang, Yikai Guo, Mingzhi Sun, Tianyu Yao, Zichen Tang, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention, that addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Link Prediction on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKG) is a worthwhile endeavor. HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectively represent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKG can be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semantic sequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs\u2019 representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

Memory Optimization for Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Aashaka Shah, Chaoxia Wu, Jayashree Mohan, Vijay Chidambaram, Philipp Krahenbuhl*\n\n**TL;DR:** MONeT is an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks, and is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning is slowly, but steadily, hitting a memory bottleneck. While the tensor computation in top-of-the-line GPUs increased by 32x over the last five years, the total available memory only grew by 2.5x. This prevents researchers from exploring larger architectures, as training large networks requires more memory for storing intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present MONeT, an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks. MONeT jointly optimizes the checkpointing schedule and the implementation of various operators. MONeT is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing. MONeT reduces the overall memory requirement by 3x for various PyTorch models, with a 9-16% overhead in computation. For the same computation cost, MONeT requires 1.2-1.8x less memory than current state-of-the-art automated checkpointing frameworks.

In contrast to\nconventional static prompting methods, Dynamic Prompting enables the adaptive\nmodification of prompt sequences and step counts based on real-time task\ncomplexity and model performance. This dynamic adaptation facilitates more\nefficient problem-solving, particularly in smaller models, by reducing\nhallucinations and repetitive cycles. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate\nthat Dynamic Prompting allows smaller LLMs to perform competitively with much\nlarger models, thereby challenging the conventional emphasis on model size as\nthe primary determinant of reasoning efficacy.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-10T17:14:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-10T17:14:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

A Hierarchical Attention Based Seq2seq Model for Chinese Lyrics\n  Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Haoshen Fan, Jie Wang, Bojin Zhuang, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we comprehensively study on context-aware generation of\nChinese song lyrics. Conventional text generative models generate a sequence or\nsentence word by word, failing to consider the contextual relationship between\nsentences. Taking account into the characteristics of lyrics, a hierarchical\nattention based Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed for Chinese\nlyrics generation. With encoding of word-level and sentence-level contextual\ninformation, this model promotes the topic relevance and consistency of\ngeneration. A large Chinese lyrics corpus is also leveraged for model training.\nEventually, results of automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our\nmodel is able to compose complete Chinese lyrics with one united topic\nconstraint.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning\nand further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with\nAdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the\nhardware barrier to training large language models.

L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-joon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language\nmodels (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces\ninference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained\nsignificant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into\nquantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while\nminimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous\nquantization-aware PEFT methods typically follow a two-step approach: first,\napplying post-training quantization (PTQ) to model weights, followed by PEFT on\nthe quantized model. However, recovering from the quantization error introduced\nby PTQ through fine-tuning has proven challenging. Additionally, most PTQ-based\nPEFT methods result in a mixture of low-precision quantized weights and\nhigh-precision adapter weights, limiting the efficiency of full quantization\nduring inference. While a previous method attempted to address these issues, it\nstill suffers from limited adaptability due to the constrained LoRA parameter\nstructure required to produce fully-quantized models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) with LoRA to effectively reduce quantization error. By employing\na memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory\noverhead while producing fully-quantized weights, enabling effective adaptation\nto downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to\nquantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled\nfine-tuning schemes, particularly in sub-4-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as\nan efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA model families and instructional\ndatasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot\nlearning.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-07T14:35:05Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-28T04:41:02Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Transfer Learning with Dynamic Distribution Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptation*\n\n*Wenjie Feng, Meiyu Huang, Yiqiang Chen, Han Yu, Qiang Yang, Jindong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transfer learning aims to learn robust classifiers for the target domain by leveraging knowledge from a source domain. Since the source and the target domains are usually from different distributions, existing methods mainly focus on adapting the cross-domain marginal or conditional distributions. However, in real applications, the marginal and conditional distributions usually have different contributions to the domain discrepancy. Existing methods fail to quantitatively evaluate the different importance of these two distributions, which will result in unsatisfactory transfer performance. In this paper, we propose a novel concept called Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (DDA), which is capable of quantitatively evaluating the relative importance of each distribution. DDA can be easily incorporated into the framework of structural risk minimization to solve transfer learning problems. On the basis of DDA, we propose two novel learning algorithms: (1) Manifold Dynamic Distribution Adaptation (MDDA) for traditional transfer learning, and (2) Dynamic Distribution Adaptation Network (DDAN) for deep transfer learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MDDA and DDAN significantly improve the transfer learning performance and setup a strong baseline over the latest deep and adversarial methods on digits recognition, sentiment analysis, and image classification. More importantly, it is shown that marginal and conditional distributions have different contributions to the domain divergence, and our DDA is able to provide good quantitative evaluation of their relative importance which leads to better performance. We believe this observation can be helpful for future research in transfer learning.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Gradient Methods with Dynamic Bound of Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic adaptation*\n\n*Xu sun, Liangchen Luo, Yuanhao Xiong, Yan Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive optimization methods such as AdaGrad, RMSprop and Adam have been\nproposed to achieve a rapid training process with an element-wise scaling term\non learning rates. Though prevailing, they are observed to generalize poorly\ncompared with SGD or even fail to converge due to unstable and extreme learning\nrates. Recent work has put forward some algorithms such as AMSGrad to tackle\nthis issue but they failed to achieve considerable improvement over existing\nmethods. In our paper, we demonstrate that extreme learning rates can lead to\npoor performance. We provide new variants of Adam and AMSGrad, called AdaBound\nand AMSBound respectively, which employ dynamic bounds on learning rates to\nachieve a gradual and smooth transition from adaptive methods to SGD and give a\ntheoretical proof of convergence. We further conduct experiments on various\npopular tasks and models, which is often insufficient in previous work.\nExperimental results show that new variants can eliminate the generalization\ngap between adaptive methods and SGD and maintain higher learning speed early\nin training at the same time. Moreover, they can bring significant improvement\nover their prototypes, especially on complex deep networks.

Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Karan Sapra, Andrew Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test).\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Jeff Rasley, Samyam Rajbhandari, Olatunji Ruwase, Yuxiong He*\n\n**Abstract:** Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware. We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO to create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-04\n\n\n\n#### 6.

However, these methods maintain second-order statistics for each parameter, thus introducing significant memory overheads that restrict the size of the model being used as well as the number of examples in a mini-batch. We describe an effective and flexible adaptive optimization method with greatly reduced memory overhead. Our method retains the benefits of per-parameter adaptivity while allowing significantly larger models and batch sizes. We give convergence guarantees for our method, and demonstrate its effectiveness in training very large translation and language models with up to 2-fold speedups compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on dynamic adaptation, hierarchical attention, and memory optimization, here are some key insights and strategies derived from the provided analysis and additional sources:\n\n## Dynamic Adaptation\n\n### Hierarchical Models and Meta-Learning\n- Integrating meta-learning strategies such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and self-supervised meta-learning can enhance the adaptability of hierarchical models.

This method, combined with hierarchical processing and adaptive normalization, can create models that dynamically adjust to varying input complexities and tasks.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n### Spatio-Temporal Consistency Learning\n- Applying spatio-temporal consistency learning, as seen in complex adaptive systems, can help in capturing nonlinear relationships and complex evolution in hierarchical models. This approach ensures that the model's representations preserve spatio-temporal consistency, which can be beneficial for language models dealing with sequential data.\n\n### Adaptive Modality Fusion\n- Incorporating adaptive modality fusion modules, similar to those in LiGAR, can empower the model to adjust its focus dynamically based on the input modality. This adaptability is crucial for handling diverse and changing input conditions.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly adaptable, efficient, and scalable, thereby achieving better overall performance in various tasks and datasets.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y.

Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03961, 2021.

Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Chelsea Finn, P. Abbeel, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 10680  (*Influential: 2358*)\n\n#### 2. Neural Relational Inference with Fast Modular Meta-learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Ferran Alet, Erica Weng, Tomas Lozano-Perez, L. Kaelbling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-learns a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed in the large search space of graph neural network compositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for many dynamical systems consisting of entities and relations. Although most GNN applications assume a single type of entity and relation, many situations involve multiple types of interactions. Relational inference is the problem of inferring these interactions and learning the dynamics from observational data. We frame relational inference as a modular meta-learning problem, where neural modules are trained to be composed in different ways to solve many tasks. This meta-learning framework allows us to implicitly encode time invariance and infer relations in context of one another rather than independently, which increases inference capacity. Framing inference as the inner-loop optimization of meta-learning leads to a model-based approach that is more data-efficient and capable of estimating the state of entities that we do not observe directly, but whose existence can be inferred from their effect on observed entities. To address the large search space of graph neural network compositions, we meta-learn a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 54  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Nathan J. Hu, E. Mitchell, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

Our model has two distinctive characteristics: (i) it has a hierarchical structure that mirrors the hierarchical structure of documents; (ii) it has two levels of attention mechanisms applied at the wordand sentence-level, enabling it to attend differentially to more and less important content when constructing the document representation. Experiments conducted on six large scale text classification tasks demonstrate that the proposed architecture outperform previous methods by a substantial margin.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

HAHE: Hierarchical Attention for Hyper-Relational Knowledge Graphs in Global and Local Level\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Haoran Luo, E. Haihong, Yuhao Yang, Yikai Guo, Mingzhi Sun, Tianyu Yao, Zichen Tang, Kaiyang Wan, Meina Song, Wei Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention, that addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time and achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Link Prediction on Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKG) is a worthwhile endeavor. HKG consists of hyper-relational facts (H-Facts), composed of a main triple and several auxiliary attribute-value qualifiers, which can effectively represent factually comprehensive information. The internal structure of HKG can be represented as a hypergraph-based representation globally and a semantic sequence-based representation locally. However, existing research seldom simultaneously models the graphical and sequential structure of HKGs, limiting HKGs\u2019 representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel Hierarchical Attention model for HKG Embedding (HAHE), including global-level and local-level attention. The global-level attention can model the graphical structure of HKG using hypergraph dual-attention layers, while the local-level attention can learn the sequential structure inside H-Facts via heterogeneous self-attention layers. Experiment results indicate that HAHE achieves state-of-the-art performance in link prediction tasks on HKG standard datasets. In addition, HAHE addresses the issue of HKG multi-position prediction for the first time, increasing the applicability of the HKG link prediction task.

Memory Optimization for Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Aashaka Shah, Chaoxia Wu, Jayashree Mohan, Vijay Chidambaram, Philipp Krahenbuhl*\n\n**TL;DR:** MONeT is an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks, and is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning is slowly, but steadily, hitting a memory bottleneck. While the tensor computation in top-of-the-line GPUs increased by 32x over the last five years, the total available memory only grew by 2.5x. This prevents researchers from exploring larger architectures, as training large networks requires more memory for storing intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present MONeT, an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks. MONeT jointly optimizes the checkpointing schedule and the implementation of various operators. MONeT is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing. MONeT reduces the overall memory requirement by 3x for various PyTorch models, with a 9-16% overhead in computation. For the same computation cost, MONeT requires 1.2-1.8x less memory than current state-of-the-art automated checkpointing frameworks.

To reduce the\nexpensive annotation efforts, semisupervised learning aims to leverage both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we review and compare three typical\nmethods in semi-supervised RE with deep learning or meta-learning:\nself-ensembling, which forces consistent under perturbations but may confront\ninsufficient supervision; self-training, which iteratively generates pseudo\nlabels and retrain itself with the enlarged labeled set; dual learning, which\nleverages a primal task and a dual task to give mutual feedback.

A Hierarchical Attention Based Seq2seq Model for Chinese Lyrics\n  Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Haoshen Fan, Jie Wang, Bojin Zhuang, Shaojun Wang, Jing Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we comprehensively study on context-aware generation of\nChinese song lyrics. Conventional text generative models generate a sequence or\nsentence word by word, failing to consider the contextual relationship between\nsentences. Taking account into the characteristics of lyrics, a hierarchical\nattention based Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence) model is proposed for Chinese\nlyrics generation. With encoding of word-level and sentence-level contextual\ninformation, this model promotes the topic relevance and consistency of\ngeneration. A large Chinese lyrics corpus is also leveraged for model training.\nEventually, results of automatic and human evaluations demonstrate that our\nmodel is able to compose complete Chinese lyrics with one united topic\nconstraint.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-15T06:58:42Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive\nparameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a\nhigh threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO)\nreduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic\ngradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal\nconvergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for\nlarge language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer,\nwe found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more\ncritical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the\nlow-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an\nadaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we\nemploy non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation\nin the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update\nnormalization to stabilize convergence.

L4Q: Parameter Efficient Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning on Large\n  Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Hyesung Jeon, Yulhwa Kim, Jae-joon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the high memory and computational costs associated with large language\nmodels (LLMs), model compression techniques such as quantization, which reduces\ninference costs, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods like\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which reduce training costs, have gained\nsignificant popularity. This trend has spurred active research into\nquantization-aware PEFT techniques, aimed at maintaining model accuracy while\nminimizing memory overhead during both inference and training. Previous\nquantization-aware PEFT methods typically follow a two-step approach: first,\napplying post-training quantization (PTQ) to model weights, followed by PEFT on\nthe quantized model. However, recovering from the quantization error introduced\nby PTQ through fine-tuning has proven challenging. Additionally, most PTQ-based\nPEFT methods result in a mixture of low-precision quantized weights and\nhigh-precision adapter weights, limiting the efficiency of full quantization\nduring inference. While a previous method attempted to address these issues, it\nstill suffers from limited adaptability due to the constrained LoRA parameter\nstructure required to produce fully-quantized models. To overcome these\nchallenges, we propose L4Q, a method that integrates Quantization-Aware\nTraining (QAT) with LoRA to effectively reduce quantization error. By employing\na memory-optimized layer design, L4Q significantly reduces QAT's memory\noverhead while producing fully-quantized weights, enabling effective adaptation\nto downstream tasks. Our experiments demonstrate that this combined approach to\nquantization and fine-tuning achieves superior accuracy compared to decoupled\nfine-tuning schemes, particularly in sub-4-bit quantization, positioning L4Q as\nan efficient QAT solution. Using the LLaMA model families and instructional\ndatasets, we showcase L4Q's capabilities in language tasks and few-shot\nlearning.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-07T14:35:05Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-28T04:41:02Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Meta-Learning Update Rules for Unsupervised Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Luke Metz, Brian Cheung, Niru Maheswaranathan*\n\n**Abstract:** A major goal of unsupervised learning is to discover data representations\nthat are useful for subsequent tasks, without access to supervised labels\nduring training. Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective,\nsuch as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that\nrepresentations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In\nthis work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by\nmeta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations\nuseful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification\nperformance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update\nrule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we\nconstrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated,\nneuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural\nnetwork architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the\nmeta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms\nexisting unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the\nmeta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with\ndifferent widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on\ndata with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image\ndatasets to a text task.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2019-5\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 2. Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Janarthanan Rajendran, Eric Jang, Alex Irpan*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning algorithms aim to learn two components: a model that predicts targets for a task, and a base learner that quickly updates that model when given examples from a new task. This additional level of learning can be powerful, but it also creates another potential source for overfitting, since we can now overfit in either the model or the base learner. We describe both of these forms of metalearning overfitting, and demonstrate that they appear experimentally in common meta-learning benchmarks. We then use an information-theoretic framework to discuss meta-augmentation, a way to add randomness that discourages the base learner and model from learning trivial solutions that do not generalize to new tasks. We demonstrate that meta-augmentation produces large complementary benefits to recently proposed meta-regularization techniques.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Multi-Scale Attention for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Karan Sapra, Andrew Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale inference is commonly used to improve the results of semantic segmentation. Multiple images scales are passed through a network and then the results are combined with averaging or max pooling. In this work, we present an attention-based approach to combining multi-scale predictions. We show that predictions at certain scales are better at resolving particular failures modes, and that the network learns to favor those scales for such cases in order to generate better predictions. Our attention mechanism is hierarchical, which enables it to be roughly 4x more memory efficient to train than other recent approaches. In addition to enabling faster training, this allows us to train with larger crop sizes which leads to greater model accuracy. We demonstrate the result of our method on two datasets: Cityscapes and Mapillary Vistas. For Cityscapes, which has a large number of weakly labelled images, we also leverage auto-labelling to improve generalization. Using our approach we achieve a new state-of-the-art results in both Mapillary (61.1 IOU val) and Cityscapes (85.1 IOU test).\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. ZeRO: Memory Optimizations Toward Training Trillion Parameter Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Jeff Rasley, Samyam Rajbhandari, Olatunji Ruwase, Yuxiong He*\n\n**Abstract:** Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware. We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO to create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-04\n\n\n\n#### 6. Memory-Efficient Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization*\n\n*Yoram Singer, Tomer Koren, Vineet Gupta, Rohan Anil*\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient-based optimizers such as Adagrad and Adam are crucial for achieving state-of-the-art performance in machine translation and language modeling. However, these methods maintain second-order statistics for each parameter, thus introducing significant memory overheads that restrict the size of the model being used as well as the number of examples in a mini-batch. We describe an effective and flexible adaptive optimization method with greatly reduced memory overhead. Our method retains the benefits of per-parameter adaptivity while allowing significantly larger models and batch sizes. We give convergence guarantees for our method, and demonstrate its effectiveness in training very large translation and language models with up to 2-fold speedups compared to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models by integrating meta-learning, hierarchical attention, and memory optimization, here are some key insights and methods derived from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Meta-Learning Integration\nMeta-learning strategies can significantly enhance the adaptability of language models. Here are some ways to integrate meta-learning:\n\n- **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML)**: This approach allows models to learn how to learn from new tasks and domains efficiently. By using meta-learning frameworks like the one described in the arXiv paper on \"Meta-Learning for Speeding Up Large Model Inference,\" you can optimize the selection of inference acceleration methods based on historical performance data. This can help in dynamically adapting the model to new tasks and improving its generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Self-Supervised Meta-Learning**: This method involves pre-training models on large datasets to improve their ability to generalize to new tasks. Self-supervised learning can be particularly effective when combined with hierarchical models, as it allows the model to learn robust representations that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks.\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\nHierarchical attention mechanisms can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of transformers:\n\n- **Weighted Grouped Query Attention**: Introducing new learnable parameters to enhance attention mechanisms can improve the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. Hierarchical attention networks, such as those proposed for stock prediction using graph neural networks, can selectively aggregate information from different relation types, leading to better performance.\n\n- **Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention**: This architecture enhances model expressiveness while being parameter and computation-efficient. It allows for dynamic composition of attention heads, which can be particularly useful in autoregressive models where context and attention play crucial roles - _though not directly mentioned in the sources, this concept aligns with the need for efficient and adaptable attention mechanisms._\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\nMemory optimization is crucial for improving the scalability and efficiency of large language models:\n\n- **FlashAttention and Dynamic Context Pruning**: These techniques can reduce computational complexity and optimize resource utilization. FlashAttention, for example, is designed to reduce the memory and computational requirements of attention mechanisms, making it more feasible to train and deploy large models. Dynamic Context Pruning can help in managing the context size dynamically, which is essential for autoregressive models that need to process long sequences efficiently.\n\n- **MetaInf Framework**: This framework, which leverages meta-learning to optimize inference acceleration, can be adapted to include memory optimization techniques. By learning from historical data, the model can predict the most effective acceleration strategies, including those related to memory management, under various operational scenarios.\n\n## Additional Methods for Improving Model Adaptability and Efficiency\n\n- **Decentralized Architectures**: Using decentralized systems that distribute computational tasks across multiple nodes can enhance efficiency, reduce latency, and improve data privacy. This approach, combined with meta-learning, can make high-performance AI more accessible and cost-effective.\n\n- **Optimizers and Preconditioning**: Advanced optimizers like Shampoo and Adagrad, which store preconditioners, can help in faster convergence and better memory management. These optimizers are particularly useful for large models where memory efficiency is critical.\n\n- **Pruning and Lottery Ticket Hypothesis**: Techniques like pruning and the lottery ticket hypothesis can help in reducing the number of parameters in the model while maintaining performance. This can be especially useful in optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly adaptable, efficient, and scalable, thereby achieving better performance in terms of perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness, and overall efficiency.\n",

A trained representation can be co-opted to map a previously unseen datum to a hypothesis, for instance a class label. Representation learning with deep neural networks has been at the core of technological progress in artificial intelligence (AI) during the past decade. This paper is instead concerned with data realizations, which are maps trained to realize, i.e., to make real, bring into existence, or generate data. Roughly speaking, realizations are \"generative representations,\" trained by optimizing a prediction criterion, that can be used as sequential decision or prediction maps, or as\n\n[^0]generative models for sequence data. Large language models (LLMs) and other predictive models that involve randomness in the sequential generation process are special cases of stochastic realizations [27]. Representations are the backbone of inference from inductive learning, or induction for short. Induction refers to the process of mapping properties of a particular set of training data, through the parameters of the learned map, to properties of general test data. Successful induction, leading to generalization, hinges on an assumption of stationarity, namely the existence of some unknown distribution from which both past (training) data and present (inference) data are independently and identically drawn (IID). While uniform generalization bounds provide provable guarantees for any distribution, they do so under the assumption that the distribution exists and is the same for training and testing. This assumption is routinely violated in practice (e.g., language, climate, and business data), as manifest in so-called \"out-of-distribution\" effects or \"distribution shift.\" These lead to apparent paradoxes involving generalization and memorization [52]. Realizations, on the other hand, are the backbone of transductive inference and generative AI (GenAI). Transduction refers to the process of inferring particular properties of test data by processing, at inference time, all given (particular) training data ${ }^{2}$ The boundary between induction and transduction is blurry: Induction can be viewed as a restricted form of transduction, where training data is accessible only through the learned weights. An over-parametrized representation, when overfit to training data, could in principle store the training set in the weights, thus making induction functionally identical to transduction. However, optimal induction aims to foster generalization by using various forms of regularization to prevent memorization, leading to sub-optimal transduction. Another form of sub-optimal transductive inference is termed \"in-context learning\" - which notably involves no learning if by learning one means to \"improve by experience:\" The same in-context task, presented multiple times, requires identical effort and leads to no improvement. In-context learning can be optimal transduction only if all the data of interest fits in the context (including the entire training set), and even then it has been proven optimal for Transformers only for simple tasks such as linear classification. In summary, Memorization and specific inference computation at the core of transduction are in contrast with the biases fostered by inductive learning: Whereas inductive inference seeks to minimize memorization to avoid overfitting and to foster generalization to unseen data, transductive inference seeks to maximize memorization and forgo generalization in favor of sample-specific inference computation ${ }^{3}$\n\nTransduction does not require the train and test distribution to be the same.\n```\n\n#### 2. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 4. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/32 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n(2020b)). The input sequences for these tasks range from 1 K to 16 K tokens and cover various data modalities. In Table 1, CHELA is compared to various baselines, such as Transformer and its efficient versions, as well as the topperforming S4 models. In order to make a fair comparison, we make sure that Mega and S 4 have a similar number of parameters by balancing the number of layers and model sizes for each task. The results are based on the average of five runs with different random seeds, and you can find the tuning information and model details in the Appendix. The performance of our model has been outstanding across all six tasks, achieving an average accuracy of $88.26 \\%$ and surpassing all the other comparison methods. Additionally, we assessed the speed of our model when applied to the byte-level classification task with a 4 K input. Our hardwareefficient linear mechanism has demonstrated remarkable efficiency, with a speed that is 5.8 times faster. It is important to highlight that our model, with its unique short-long convolutions hybrid design, exhibits even greater efficiency compared to a variety of linear Transformers, Structured State Space Models, and recent hybrid models.

Accuracy on Speech Commands dataset. |  | SpeechCommand-Raw |  |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: |\n| Model | \\#Param. | Accuracy |\n| Transformer | 786 K | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2021) | 300 K | $\\frac{97.50}{\\boldsymbol{X}}$ |\n| Mega (Ma et al., 2022) | - | 96.03 |\n| Mega-chunk (Ma et al., 2022) | 476 K | $\\mathbf{9 7 . 9 8}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | 493 K | $\\mathbf{9}$ |\n\n### 5.2. Raw Speech Classification\n\nWe intend to evaluate the capability of CHELA in modeling lengthy speech signals by employing it for the classification of unaltered speech signals with a duration of 16000, instead of depending on traditional preprocessing techniques like converting them into MFCC features. As per Gu et al. (2021) approach, we classify speech on the Speech Commands dataset's SC10 subset, which was introduced by Warden (2018). As reported in (Ma et al., 2022), the Mega-chunk uses a chunk size of 1000 to enable processing the data. In Table 2, our model has 493 K parameters and achieves a $97.98 \\%$ accuracy, making it the leading method in this table. This result is primarily due to the suitability of long convolutions for processing the numerous continuous and low-frequency signals present in speech. Additionally, the ability of short convolutions to capture rich global information enables attention to focus on important aspects. ### 5.3. Auto-Regressive Language Modeling\n\nBy following Ma et al. (2022); Lingle (2023), we assess CHELA on two popular language modeling datasets, i.e., WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), which are next-token prediction tasks. WikiText-103 is a dataset for word-level language modeling with 103 million tokens from Wikipedia articles in its training set. In line with previous work (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), our method involves using adaptive softmax and input embeddings, and we utilize a vocabulary of 260,000 tokens. Enwik8 is a commonly used benchmark for character-level language\n\nTable 3. Performance of pixel-level classification on the sCIFAR. | Model | Accuracy (\\%) |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Attention: |  |\n| Transformer (Trinh et al., 2018) | 62.20 |\n| $R N N:$ |  |\n| LSTM (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) | 63.01 |\n| r-LSTM (Trinh et al., 2018) | 72.20 |\n| UR-GRU (Gu et al., 2020b) | 74.40 |\n| HiPPO-RNN (Gu et al., 2020a) | 61.10 |\n| LipschitzRNN (Erichson et al., 2020) | 64.20 |\n| State Space Models: |  |\n| S4 (Gu et al., 2022) | 91.80 |\n| S4D (Gu et al., 2022) | 90.69 |\n| S5 (Smith et al., 2023) | 90.10 |\n| Liquid-S4 (Hasani et al., 2022) | 92.02 |\n| Convolution: |  |\n| TrellisNet (Bai et al., 2018) | 73.42 |\n| CKConv (Li et al., 2022) | 63.74 |\n| FlexConv (Romero et al., 2021) | 80.82 |\n| MultiresNet (Shi et al., 2023) | $\\mathbf{9 3 . 1 5}$ |\n| CHELA (ours) | $\\mathbf{9 4 . 0 2}$ |\n\nmodeling, presenting a significant challenge to models. It comprises approximately 100 million unprocessed tokens from Wikipedia articles and has a vocabulary size of about 200. When evaluating language models, we segment the test data and process each segment sequentially during testing to assess their effectiveness. In Table 4, we compare with previous top-performing models that are designed to take advantage of longer context, including Transformers (Baevski \\& Auli, 2019), Transformer-XL and S4 (Gu et al., 2021). The model we developed demonstrated outstanding performance on both WikiText-103 and enwik8 datasets, outperforming the baseline models by a significant margin. Our model achieves an inference speed that is almost 10 times faster than the Pure Transformer model. The hybrid structure of the short-long convolutions layer plays a crucial role in enabling our model to manage length extrapolation during inference, allowing it to process longer sequences than those encountered during training. This distinctive characteristic of our model enhances its capability to naturally handle complex tasks, making it a valuable addition to any long-sequence project. Table 4.

Pixel-Level Sequential Image Classification\n\nBegin by addressing tasks related to image classification, in which images are considered as a one-dimensional sequence of pixels. In these tasks, models cannot rely on preconceived two-dimensional structures within the image. Consequently, the model must possess the ability to recognize patterns at different temporal scales, including pixels that are close together in the original image but far apart in their sequential representation. We evaluate the performance of our model using the Sequential CIFAR-10 dataset, commonly used as a benchmark for capturing long-term dependencies in RNNs. The CIFAR-10 dataset is frequently employed in machine learning for tasks on image classification. Within this dataset, the typical training and testing split is maintained, reserving $10 \\%$ of the training set for validation purposes. To categorize the images, the mean of all tokens in the output sequences is computed, and the resulting values are subjected to a fully connected layer to produce class logits. The Table 3 displays the results. CHELA has achieved state-of-the-art performance and the best test accuracy on the sequence classification task, surpassing multiple strong competitors such as Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017), RNNs, state space models, and other convolutional models. In particular, the CHELA model has exceeded the performance of previous convolution-based models by more than ten percentage points. It is important to note that our model has delivered impressive results by surpassing the previously established performance standard, even though it uses a relatively simple architecture. The model primarily employs a hybrid method that compresses long historical information based on the output of short-long convolutions. Our most effective model consists of ten CHELA blocks, which significantly contribute to achieving exceptional performance. ## 6. Ablation Study\n\nOur ablation experiments focus on answering two key questions mostly related to our design: (1) Does the hardwarefriendly implementation significantly improve the speed of linear attention? (2) The effectiveness of our proposed short-long convolutions module on long sequences. Q1: Benchmark hardware-efficient linear attention. To answer the first question, our Hardware-Efficient Linear\n\nAttention achieves almost real linear relationships with sequence lengths. We conducted an analysis on the WikiText103 dataset with models with 200M parameters. As visualized in Fig. 4, we have more than doubled the speedup of the original Pytorch implementation of the linear attention. Q2: Analysis of short-long convolutions. To answer the second question, we further combined a variety of hybrid models following the modeling structure of CHELA. Specifically, we compared the representative SSM-like modules on the subset of the LRA (Tay et al., 2020b) dataset (Text, Image, and PathX). It is clear that the proposed ShortLong Convolutions are the best partner for linear attention. Table 6.

Related Works\n\nEfficient transformer models A variety of efforts have been made to decrease the quadratic time and space complexity of standard attention mechanisms. One method is to utilize \"sparse attention,\" where each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens based on predefined patterns, such as neighboring tokens within a fixed-size window. (Child et al., 2019) started the attempt to sparse the attention, and then there were a lot more followers, such as ETC (Ainslie et al., 2020), Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020), BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020), Poolingformer (Zhang et al., 2021), and HEPOS (Huang et al., 2021) are some examples of this approach. Another option is to utilize \"lowrank projection,\" as mentioned in the work by (Wang et al., 2020). Similar techniques include Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al., 2021), Synthesizer (Tay et al., 2021), and Luna (Ma\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_542e0cd768b54533ad80g-08.jpg?height=375&width=833&top_left_y=1951&top_left_x=185)\n\nFigure 4. Comparative Analysis of Speed: Runtime in milliseconds for the forward and backward pass across varying lengths. et al., 2021). However, these methods encounter challenges when dealing with causal tasks, such as auto-regressive language modeling. Another approach uses \"clustering method,\" where we partition $\\mathbf{Q}$ or $\\mathbf{K}$ into multiple clusters and perform inter-cluster attention. Examples of such methods include Sinkhorn Transformer (Tay et al., 2020a), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Routing Transformer (Roy et al., 2021), and simplified FLASH (Hua et al., 2022), etc. \"Methods based on kernels\" can be utilized to approximate the complete attention $\\operatorname{Attn}(\\mathbf{X})$. These methods replace the quadratic-time softmax attention with fast linear-time kernel approximations (such as Gaussian and arc-cosine kernels). Some instances of this approach include Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020), and FMMformer (Nguyen et al., 2021), etc. Both low-dimensional projection and methods based on kernels are employed to estimate full attention and, as a result, are vulnerable to significant approximation errors. State space models and long convolutions Recurrent neural networks and their linear counterparts such as statespace models are capable of retaining memory of the past. Among these models, S 4 (Gu et al., 2021) is notable because it can be implemented through convolutions thanks to its linear recurrence. However, the long convolution kernel for this model is as long as the input sequence, and its efficient computation requires sophisticated parameterization and approximation techniques. Although recent advances have found solutions to this issue, initializing these models still requires special effort (Gupta et al., 2022; Gu et al., 2020b). Many of these models use the HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020a) initialization mechanism, which aims to memorize historical data through projection to orthogonal polynomials. Based on a structure similar to SSM, an increasing number of models focusing on either linear recurrence or global convolution have been developed recently (Fu et al., 2023b;a; Poli et al., 2023; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Hardware-efficient implementation The FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) is dedicated to optimizing the standard attention operator for GPU platforms at the system level.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Recurrent Memory Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid transformer architecture implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence.

NAT: Neural Architecture Transformer for Accurate and Compact Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid transformer architecture implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Yong Guo, Yin Zheng, Mingkui Tan, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, P. Zhao, Junzhou Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing effective architectures is one of the key factors behind the success of deep neural networks. Existing deep architectures are either manually designed or automatically searched by some Neural Architecture Search (NAS) methods. However, even a well-searched architecture may still contain many non-significant or redundant modules or operations (e.g., convolution or pooling), which may not only incur substantial memory consumption and computation cost but also deteriorate the performance. Thus, it is necessary to optimize the operations inside an architecture to improve the performance without introducing extra computation cost. Unfortunately, such a constrained optimization problem is NP-hard. To make the problem feasible, we cast the optimization problem into a Markov decision process (MDP) and seek to learn a Neural Architecture Transformer (NAT) to replace the redundant operations with the more computationally efficient ones (e.g., skip connection or directly removing the connection). Based on MDP, we learn NAT by exploiting reinforcement learning to obtain the optimization policies w.r.t. different architectures. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we apply NAT on both hand-crafted architectures and NAS based architectures. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, i.e., CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, demonstrate that the transformed architecture by NAT significantly outperforms both its original form and those architectures optimized by existing methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Memory Optimization for Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid transformer architecture implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Aashaka Shah, Chaoxia Wu, Jayashree Mohan, Vijay Chidambaram, Philipp Krahenbuhl*\n\n**TL;DR:** MONeT is an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks, and is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning is slowly, but steadily, hitting a memory bottleneck. While the tensor computation in top-of-the-line GPUs increased by 32x over the last five years, the total available memory only grew by 2.5x. This prevents researchers from exploring larger architectures, as training large networks requires more memory for storing intermediate outputs. In this paper, we present MONeT, an automatic framework that minimizes both the memory footprint and computational overhead of deep networks. MONeT jointly optimizes the checkpointing schedule and the implementation of various operators. MONeT is able to outperform all prior hand-tuned operations as well as automated checkpointing. MONeT reduces the overall memory requirement by 3x for various PyTorch models, with a 9-16% overhead in computation. For the same computation cost, MONeT requires 1.2-1.8x less memory than current state-of-the-art automated checkpointing frameworks.

HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid transformer architecture implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid transformer architecture implementation memory optimization*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, W. Neiswanger, P. Xie, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO, is introduced with a novel dataflow graph that allows to develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O( d^2), and enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

By partitioning the input into mini-sequences, MsT can significantly reduce the intermediate memory occupation without compromising the throughput performance. This method is particularly useful for models with large intermediate values, such as those in the attention and MLP blocks of transformers.\n\n### Optimized Memory Access Patterns\nTechniques like Flashattention and Xformer optimize memory access patterns to achieve linear memory scaling, which is crucial for handling long sequences without overwhelming the GPU memory. These methods use kernel fusion and optimized memory access to mitigate the quadratic growth in memory demand associated with self-attention operations.\n\n### Hybrid Parallelism\nHybrid parallelism, combining data and model parallelism, can significantly reduce memory requirements. By distributing the weight matrices across multiple GPUs, each device only needs to store a fraction of the total weights, enhancing memory efficiency and reducing the computational burden.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Adaptive Computation Methods\n\n### Adaptive Optimization Algorithms\nUsing adaptive optimization algorithms like AdamW can help in reducing the number of epochs required for training and minimizing the risk of overfitting. These algorithms adjust the learning rate based on parameter updates, leading to faster convergence and improved training efficiency.\n\n### Mixed-Precision Training\nMixed-precision training leverages both 16-bit and 32-bit floating-point types to reduce memory usage and increase computational speed. This technique can accelerate training without significant loss in model accuracy and decrease energy consumption during training.\n\n### Activation Recomputation\nTechniques like activation recomputation can reduce the peak memory usage by recomputing activations during the backward pass instead of storing them. This approach is particularly beneficial for models with large vocabularies and MLP intermediates.\n\n## Integration Approaches for Different Architectural Components\n\n### Hybrid Transformer and RNN Architectures\nIntegrating transformer-based architectures with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can leverage the strengths of both. For example, the TRABSA model combines transformer-based attention mechanisms with bidirectional RNNs, enhancing performance in tasks that benefit from both sequential and attention-based processing.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\nHierarchical transformers can be integrated with adaptive computation strategies to improve efficiency. Multi-scale processing can be combined with adaptive computation to balance computational overhead and model expressiveness. This approach is crucial for maintaining model performance while optimizing computation[Analysis Note].\n\n## Practical Efficiency Considerations in Hybrid Designs\n\n### Model Partitioning and Load Balancing\nEffective model partitioning and load balancing are essential for hybrid parallelism. Techniques like tensor parallelism and pipeline parallelism allow for efficient utilization of resources by parallelizing computations within a single operation or across different layers. Ensuring even distribution of the computational workload among available resources minimizes idle time and maximizes training efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Designs\nHardware-aware implementations are crucial for practical efficiency. Optimizing memory access patterns, computational complexity, and using cloud-based infrastructure and services can enhance training efficiency and reduce associated costs. Custom training architectures using cloud-based virtual machines and GPUs can provide flexibility and scalability.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can develop hybrid transformer architectures that are memory-efficient, computationally adaptive, and scalable, ultimately improving the performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Zhao, Y., Li, J., and Gong, Y. Low-rank plus diagonal adaptation for deep neural networks. In 2016 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pp. 5005-5009. IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Denis Xavier Charles, Eren Manavoglu, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2022)\t**Cited by** 29  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed SPADE augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods and demonstrates the scalability of the proposed method.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 4. ETC: Encoding Long and Structured Inputs in Transformers (Avg.

In this paper, we present a new Transformer architecture, Extended Transformer Construction (ETC), that addresses two key challenges of standard Transformer architectures, namely scaling input length and encoding structured inputs. To scale attention to longer inputs, we introduce a novel global-local attention mechanism between global tokens and regular input tokens. We also show that combining global-local attention with relative position encodings and a Contrastive Predictive Coding (CPC) pre-training objective allows ETC to encode structured inputs. We achieve state-of-the-art results on four natural language datasets requiring long and/or structured inputs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nLesly Miculicich, Dhananjay Ram, Nikolaos Pappas, and James Henderson. 2018.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention meta-learning transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Secretly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention meta-learning transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Damai Dai, Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Y. Hao, Zhifang Sui, Furu Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the understanding of meta-optimization, a momentum-based attention is designed by analogy with the momentum- based gradient descent algorithm and its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports the understanding from another aspect.\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained language models have shown surprising In-Context Learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without additional parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, the working mechanism of ICL still remains an open problem. In order to better understand how ICL works, this paper explains language models as meta-optimizers and understands ICL as a kind of implicit \ufb01netuning. Theoretically, we \ufb01gure out that the Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent based optimization. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT \ufb01rst produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare the behavior of ICL and explicit \ufb01netuning based on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. The results prove that ICL behaves similarly to explicit \ufb01netuning at the prediction level, the representation level, and the attention behavior level. Further, inspired by our understanding of meta-optimization, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with the momentum-based gradient descent algorithm. Its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports our understanding again from another aspect, and more impor-tantly, it shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model designing.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 230  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 4.

Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention meta-learning transformer memory optimization*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model (LM) by integrating hierarchical attention mechanisms, meta-learning strategies, and memory optimization techniques, here are some key points and techniques that can be considered:\n\n### Methods for Combining Multi-Scale Processing with Adaptive Computation\n\n1. **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - The SMGformer model provides an example of integrating multi-scale processing through techniques like Seasonal and Trend decomposition using Loess (STL) and Informer's Encoder layer. This approach allows the model to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies effectively.\n   - Hierarchical attention can be implemented by using multiple attention heads that focus on different scales of the input sequence. This is similar to the multi-head self-attention (MHSA) mechanism, which maps inputs into different linear spaces and computes attention independently within each space.\n\n2. **Adaptive Computation**:\n   - Techniques like the Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT) can be used to optimize the processing of long sequences. MsT partitions input sequences into mini-sequences and iteratively processes them, reducing intermediate memory usage without degrading throughput or convergence.\n\n### Techniques for Efficient Memory Management in Hierarchical Transformers\n\n1. **Memory Optimization**:\n   - The MsT approach is particularly effective in reducing memory usage by processing sequences in smaller chunks. This method integrates activation recomputation to save memory in both forward and backward passes, making it suitable for training with extremely long sequences.\n   - Other techniques like Flashattention and Xformer optimize memory access patterns to achieve linear memory scaling, which can be crucial for hierarchical transformers dealing with long sequences.\n\n2. **Intermediate Memory Reduction**:\n   - By analyzing the intermediate values generated by transformer blocks, MsT identifies that these values are often larger than the input and output sizes. Optimizing these intermediate values can significantly reduce memory usage while maintaining performance.\n\n### Implementation Strategies for Meta-Learning in Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Meta-Learning Integration**:\n   - Meta-learning can be integrated into transformer architectures by training the model on a variety of tasks to improve its ability to learn new tasks quickly. Techniques such as meta-learning with prototypical networks or few-shot learning can be employed to enhance the model's adaptability.\n   - The use of domain-specific fine-tuning and data augmentation can also be part of the meta-learning strategy to tailor the model to specific fields and improve its robustness.\n\n2. **Dynamic Adaptation**:\n   - By incorporating meta-learning, the model can dynamically adapt to new tasks or datasets. This can be achieved through techniques like few-shot learning, where the model learns to capture contextual relationships and transfer knowledge from related tasks.\n\n### Approaches to Balancing Adaptability and Computational Efficiency\n\n1. **Efficient Training Methods**:\n   - Optimizers like Adam and Shampoo can be used to improve convergence behavior while managing computational efficiency. Shampoo, in particular, has been shown to converge quicker than other optimizers by storing preconditioners at varying levels of granularity.\n   - Techniques such as intra-layer model parallelism can be used to train large models efficiently across multiple GPUs, enhancing scalability without compromising performance.\n\n2. **Adaptive Mechanisms**:\n   - The integration of hierarchical attention and meta-learning should be balanced with efficient memory management. For example, using MHSA with adaptive computation can help in focusing on different parts of the input sequence while optimizing memory usage.\n\n3. **Trade-Offs Analysis**:\n   - It is crucial to analyze the trade-offs between adaptability and computational overhead. For instance, increasing the number of layers or attention heads can enhance the model's ability to learn complex representations but also increases computational costs. Balancing these aspects through careful parameter tuning and optimization techniques is essential.\n\nBy combining these approaches, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that integrates hierarchical attention mechanisms, leverages meta-learning for dynamic adaptation, optimizes memory usage, and balances adaptability with computational efficiency.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.07)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Hierarchical Context Merging: Better Long Context Understanding for Pre-trained LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Woomin Song, Seunghyuk Oh, Sangwoo Mo, Jaehyung Kim, Sukmin Yun, Jung-Woo Ha, Jinwoo Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HOMER is presented, a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations of large language models by employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers and proposes an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context.

History Aware Multimodal Transformer for Vision-and-Language Navigation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Shizhe Chen, Pierre-Louis Guhur, C. Schmid, I. Laptev*\n\n**TL;DR:** A History Aware Multimodal Transformer (HAMT) is introduced to incorporate a long-horizon history into multimodal decision making for vision-and-language navigation and achieves new state of the art on a broad range of VLN tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to build autonomous visual agents that follow instructions and navigate in real scenes. To remember previously visited locations and actions taken, most approaches to VLN implement memory using recurrent states. Instead, we introduce a History Aware Multimodal Transformer (HAMT) to incorporate a long-horizon history into multimodal decision making. HAMT efficiently encodes all the past panoramic observations via a hierarchical vision transformer (ViT), which first encodes individual images with ViT, then models spatial relation between images in a panoramic observation and finally takes into account temporal relation between panoramas in the history. It, then, jointly combines text, history and current observation to predict the next action. We first train HAMT end-to-end using several proxy tasks including single step action prediction and spatial relation prediction, and then use reinforcement learning to further improve the navigation policy. HAMT achieves new state of the art on a broad range of VLN tasks, including VLN with fine-grained instructions (R2R, RxR), high-level instructions (R2R-Last, REVERIE), dialogs (CVDN) as well as long-horizon VLN (R4R, R2R-Back). We demonstrate HAMT to be particularly effective for navigation tasks with longer trajectories.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 46*)\n\n#### 3. M3ViT: Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer for Efficient Multi-task Learning with Model-Accelerator Co-design\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Hanxue Liang, Zhiwen Fan, Rishov Sarkar, Ziyu Jiang, Tianlong Chen, Kai Zou, Yu Cheng, Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL that customizes mixture-of-experts layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training, and is enhanced by hardware-level innovations.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively. We open-source a privacy engine (\\url{https://github.com/woodyx218/private_vision}) that implements DP training of CNN with a few lines of code.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

Tree Methods for Hierarchical Classification in Parallel\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose methods that enable efficient hierarchical classification in parallel. Our methods transform a batch of classification scores and labels, corresponding to given nodes in a semantic tree, to scores and labels corresponding to all nodes in the ancestral paths going down the tree to every given node, relying only on tensor operations that execute efficiently on hardware accelerators. We implement our methods and test them on current hardware accelerators with a tree incorporating all English-language synsets in WordNet 3.0, spanning 117,659 classes in 20 levels of depth. We transform batches of scores and labels to their respective ancestral paths, incurring negligible computation and consuming only a fixed 0.04GB of memory over the footprint of data.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer implementation memory efficiency*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods. The code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/moabarar/qna}.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical transformer implementations, memory efficiency, and efficient computation strategies, here are some key points and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques\n\n### Mini-Sequence Transformer (MsT)\nThe MsT approach is particularly effective for optimizing memory usage during the training of long sequence models. It involves partitioning input sequences into mini-sequences and processing them iteratively, which reduces intermediate memory usage significantly. This method integrates with activation recomputation to minimize memory overhead without degrading throughput or convergence.\n\n### Recursive Transformers\nRecursive Transformers, developed by DeepMind, reuse parameters across multiple layers, which significantly reduces the memory footprint. This approach allows for greater depth of analysis with fewer parameters, making the model more efficient in terms of memory usage and computational resources. The use of LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) layers adds flexibility without expanding the model size unnecessarily.\n\n### Chunk-Based Memory Architectures\nChunk-based memory architectures, as suggested in the analysis note, can improve long-term retention and efficiency. This involves dividing the past into chunks and recalling by performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of these chunks. This hierarchical memory organization can enhance recall and reduce memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Computation Strategies for Hierarchical Attention\n\n### Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA)\nDCMHA is a parameter and computation-efficient attention architecture that dynamically composes attention heads. This approach increases the expressive power of the model while tackling the shortcomings of traditional multi-head attention mechanisms. It is particularly useful for hierarchical processing and can enhance the model's ability to capture complex relationships within sequences[Analysis Note, 5].\n\n### Multi-Head Attention Mechanism\nThe traditional multi-head attention mechanism in transformers allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously. For hierarchical transformers, this can be extended by using multiple layers of attention, each focusing on different scales or aspects of the input sequence. This can be optimized further by using techniques like kernel fusion and optimized memory access patterns to mitigate the quadratic complexity of self-attention operations.\n\n## Integration Methods for Different Processing Scales\n\n### Hierarchical Processing with Adaptive Computation\nHierarchical processing can be combined with adaptive computation to efficiently handle different scales of input. This involves dynamically adjusting the computational resources based on the complexity of the input sequence. For example, using recursive transformers with stepwise initialization and continuous depth-wise batching can streamline processing and boost throughput.\n\n### Meta-Learning Integration\nIntegrating meta-learning with hierarchical attention mechanisms can improve sample efficiency and generalization. Meta-learning can be implemented through implicit gradient descent, and hierarchical prototypes can enhance cross-domain generalization. This integration can be particularly beneficial for tasks that require adapting to new data or tasks over time[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization Approaches\n\n### Optimized Memory Access Patterns\nOptimized memory access patterns, such as those used in Flashattention and Xformer, can help achieve linear memory scaling instead of the quadratic complexity associated with traditional self-attention operations. These techniques are crucial for reducing memory overhead and enabling the training of larger models on available hardware.\n\n### Parameter Sharing and LoRA\nRecursive transformers that reuse parameters across layers and use LoRA for slight adjustments can significantly reduce GPU memory usage. This approach allows for more efficient training and inference, making it possible to scale models with less expensive hardware.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop hierarchical transformer architectures that are highly memory-efficient, computationally efficient, and scalable, thereby improving the overall performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/37 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 35151-35174.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/25 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\n# Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models \n\nPiotr Nawrot ${ }^{* 1}$, Szymon Tworkowski ${ }^{* 1}$, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski ${ }^{1}$, Lukasz Kaiser ${ }^{2}$,<br>Yuhuai Wu ${ }^{3}$, Christian Szegedy ${ }^{3}$, Henryk Michalewski ${ }^{3}$<br>${ }^{1}$ University of Warsaw, ${ }^{2}$ OpenAI, ${ }^{3}$ Google Research<br>\\{p.nawrot99, szy.tworkowski, michal.tyrolski, lukaszkaiser\\}@gmail.com,<br>\\{yuhuai, szegedy, henrykm\\}@google.com\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 3. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.56)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

IEEE, 2016. ## A. Related work\n\nWe overview some prior works related to our DCMHA in the following subsections. ## A.1. Architecture Modifications to Transformers\n\nSince being introduced seven years ago, many modifications to the Transformer architecture have been proposed. However, relatively few of them generalize well across domains and scales and have seen widespread adoption (Narang et al., 2021) Some notable successful ones include Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) and Rotary Position Encoding (Su et al., 2024) for improving long-context handling and position encoding, GLU MLP (Shazeer, 2020) and Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) MLP (Lepikhin et al., 2020; Fedus et al., 2022) for more expressive or efficient MLP nonlinearty and architecture, UL2 (Tay et al., 2022) and GLM (Du et al., 2021) for better training objectives. Among these, RoPE and SwiGLU MLP have been adopted by recent well-known foundation models such as Palm (Chowdhery et al., 2023) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023), and are also used as our strong baseline (Transformer++). ## A.2. Improving MHA by Head Collaboration\n\nNoticing the problems caused by the independent working of attention heads, various forms of cross-head collaboration or interaction mechanisms have been proposed (Li et al., 2019; Zhang et al., 2022; Cordonnier et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2022; Shazeer et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2022; Nguyen et al., 2022). While some of these works mainly focus on improving parameter or computation efficiency of MHA by reducing head redundancy (Cordonnier et al., 2020; Nguyen et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022), we aim to improve model performance. Sharing the same goal as ours, Wang et al. (2022) proposed a Multi-Head Dense Collaboration (MHDC) mechanism and evaluate it primarily on Neural Machine Translation and some other small NLP tasks. MHDC is essentially the same as the static projection of attention scores in pre-compose of DCMHA, although they enhance it with cross-layer collaboration. We propose a more comprehensive head composition framework which supports dynamic composition of both attention scores and weights with pre- and post-compose, evaluate on large scale language model pretraining as well as downstream tasks. The work most closely related to ours is Talking-Heads Attention (THA) (Shazeer et al., 2020), which proposed to use two learned cross-head projections before and after softmax to transform the attention score and attention weight tensor respectively, which is same as pre- and post-compose with only static projections in DCMHA. They showed the effectiveness of THA in T5-style pretraining and downstream evaluation. We more clearly motivate head composition by relating it to projection composition, propose dynamic composition to further increase model expressiveness significantly, and offer a parameter and computation efficient design and implementation based on two-level tensor decomposition. The authors of THA also proposed a dynamic variant of THA in Appendix A of the paper, but compared with ours, the parameter and computation overhead is too large for practical use (see Table 8 in Appendix A of Shazeer et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Score: 0.16)\n\n*Weihao Yu, Mi Luo, Pan Zhou, Chenyang Si, Yichen Zhou, Xinchao Wang, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan*\n\n**Published in:** Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2021)\t**Cited by** 608  (*Influential: 90*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks, and calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. A common belief is their attention-based token mixer module contributes most to their competence. However, recent works show the attention-based module in transformers can be replaced by spatial MLPs and the resulted models still perform quite well. Based on this observation, we hypothesize that the general architecture of the transformers, instead of the specific token mixer module, is more essential to the model's performance. To verify this, we deliberately replace the attention module in transformers with an embarrassingly simple spatial pooling operator to conduct only basic token mixing. Surprisingly, we observe that the derived model, termed as PoolFormer, achieves competitive performance on multiple computer vision tasks. For example, on ImageNet-1K, PoolFormer achieves 82.1 % top-1 accuracy, surpassing well-tuned vision transformer/MLP-like baselines DeiT-B/ResMLP-B24 by 0.3%/1.1% accuracy with 35%/52% fewer parameters and 49%/61% fewer MACs. The effectiveness of Pool-Former verifies our hypothesis and urges us to initiate the concept of \u201cMetaFormer\u201d, a general architecture abstracted from transformers without specifying the token mixer. Based on the extensive experiments, we argue that MetaFormer is the key player in achieving superior results for recent transformer and MLP-like models on vision tasks. This work calls for more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Additionally, our proposed PoolFormer could serve as a starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/30 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nattention. The contributions of our paper are two-fold. Firstly, we abstract Transformers into a general architecture MetaFormer, and empirically demonstrate that the success of Transformer/MLP-like models is largely attributed to the MetaFormer architecture. Specifically, by only employing a simple non-parametric operator, pooling, as an extremely weak token mixer for MetaFormer, we build a simple model named PoolFormer and find it can still achieve highly competitive performance. We hope our findings inspire more future research dedicated to improving MetaFormer instead of focusing on the token mixer modules. Secondly, we evaluate the proposed PoolFormer on multiple vision tasks including image classification [14], object detection [34], instance segmentation [34], and semantic segmentation [67], and find it achieves competitive performance compared with the SOTA models using sophistic design of token mixers. The PoolFormer can readily serve as a good starting baseline for future MetaFormer architecture design. ## 2. Related work\n\nTransformers are first proposed by [56] for translation tasks and then rapidly become popular in various NLP tasks. In language pre-training tasks, Transformers are trained on large-scale unlabeled text corpus and achieve amazing performance $[2,15]$. Inspired by the success of Transformers in NLP, many researchers apply attention mechanism and Transformers to vision tasks [3, 8, 44, 55]. Notably, Chen et al. introduce iGPT [6] where the Transformer is trained to auto-regressively predict pixels on images for self-supervised learning. Dosovitskiy et al. propose Vision Transformer (ViT) with hard patch embedding as input [17]. They show that on supervised image classification tasks, a ViT pre-trained on a large propriety dataset (JFT dataset with 300 million images) can achieve excellent performance. DeiT [53] and T2T-ViT [63] further demonstrate that the ViT pre-trained on only ImageNet-1K $(\\sim 1.3$ million images) from scratch can achieve promising performance.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Transformer Neural Processes: Uncertainty-Aware Meta Learning Via Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation*\n\n*Tung Nguyen, Aditya Grover*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), a new member of the NP family that casts uncertainty-aware meta learning as a sequence modeling problem and shows that TNPs achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are a popular class of approaches for meta-learning. Similar to Gaussian Processes (GPs), NPs define distributions over functions and can estimate uncertainty in their predictions. However, unlike GPs, NPs and their variants suffer from underfitting and often have intractable likelihoods, which limit their applications in sequential decision making. We propose Transformer Neural Processes (TNPs), a new member of the NP family that casts uncertainty-aware meta learning as a sequence modeling problem. We learn TNPs via an autoregressive likelihood-based objective and instantiate it with a novel transformer-based architecture. The model architecture respects the inductive biases inherent to the problem structure, such as invariance to the observed data points and equivariance to the unobserved points. We further investigate knobs within the TNP framework that tradeoff expressivity of the decoding distribution with extra computation. Empirically, we show that TNPs achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmark problems, outperforming all previous NP variants on meta regression, image completion, contextual multi-armed bandits, and Bayesian optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 79  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Vector Quantized Transformer for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation*\n\n*Ruiying Lu, Yujie Wu, Long Tian, Dongsheng Wang, Bo Chen, Xiyang Liu, Ruimin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework, and investigates an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised image Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to learn robust and discriminative representations of normal samples. While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the\"identical shortcut\"issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability.

NodeFormer: A Scalable Graph Structure Learning Transformer for Node Classification\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation*\n\n*Qitian Wu, Wentao Zhao, Zenan Li, D. Wipf, Junchi Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating node signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a pioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs, dubbed as NodeFormer.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks have been extensively studied for learning with inter-connected data. Despite this, recent evidence has revealed GNNs' deficiencies related to over-squashing, heterophily, handling long-range dependencies, edge incompleteness and particularly, the absence of graphs altogether. While a plausible solution is to learn new adaptive topology for message passing, issues concerning quadratic complexity hinder simultaneous guarantees for scalability and precision in large networks. In this paper, we introduce a novel all-pair message passing scheme for efficiently propagating node signals between arbitrary nodes, as an important building block for a pioneering Transformer-style network for node classification on large graphs, dubbed as \\textsc{NodeFormer}. Specifically, the efficient computation is enabled by a kernerlized Gumbel-Softmax operator that reduces the algorithmic complexity to linearity w.r.t. node numbers for learning latent graph structures from large, potentially fully-connected graphs in a differentiable manner. We also provide accompanying theory as justification for our design. Extensive experiments demonstrate the promising efficacy of the method in various tasks including node classification on graphs (with up to 2M nodes) and graph-enhanced applications (e.g., image classification) where input graphs are missing.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 148  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 4.

Neiswanger, Pengtao Xie, Emma Strubell, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite its flexibility to learn diverse inductive biases in machine learning programs, meta learning (i.e., learning to learn) has long been recognized to suffer from poor scalability due to its tremendous compute/memory costs, training instability, and a lack of efficient distributed training support. In this work, we focus on making scalable meta learning practical by introducing SAMA, which combines advances in both implicit differentiation algorithms and systems. Specifically, SAMA is designed to flexibly support a broad range of adaptive optimizers in the base level of meta learning programs, while reducing computational burden by avoiding explicit computation of second-order gradient information, and exploiting efficient distributed training techniques implemented for first-order gradients. Evaluated on multiple large-scale meta learning benchmarks, SAMA showcases up to 1.7/4.8x increase in throughput and 2.0/3.8x decrease in memory consumption respectively on single-/multi-GPU setups compared to other baseline meta learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show that SAMA-based data optimization leads to consistent improvements in text classification accuracy with BERT and RoBERTa large language models, and achieves state-of-the-art results in both small- and large-scale data pruning on image classification tasks, demonstrating the practical applicability of scalable meta learning across language and vision domains.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Learning Hierarchical Image Segmentation For Recognition and By Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation*\n\n*Tsung-Wei Ke, Sangwoo Mo, Stella X. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, train and adapt the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives, and learns hierarchical segmentation for free alongside recognition, automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition.\n\n**Abstract:** Large vision and language models learned directly through image-text associations often lack detailed visual substantiation, whereas image segmentation tasks are treated separately from recognition, supervisedly learned without interconnections. Our key observation is that, while an image can be recognized in multiple ways, each has a consistent part-and-whole visual organization. Segmentation thus should be treated not as an end task to be mastered through supervised learning, but as an internal process that evolves with and supports the ultimate goal of recognition. We propose to integrate a hierarchical segmenter into the recognition process, train and adapt the entire model solely on image-level recognition objectives. We learn hierarchical segmentation for free alongside recognition, automatically uncovering part-to-whole relationships that not only underpin but also enhance recognition. Enhancing the Vision Transformer (ViT) with adaptive segment tokens and graph pooling, our model surpasses ViT in unsupervised part-whole discovery, semantic segmentation, image classification, and efficiency. Notably, our model (trained on unlabeled 1M ImageNet images) outperforms SAM (trained on 11M images and 1 billion masks) by absolute 8% in mIoU on PartImageNet object segmentation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning hierarchical transformer adaptive computation*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating meta-learning with hierarchical transformers, focusing on adaptive computation strategies, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Methods for Combining Meta-Learning with Hierarchical Attention\n\n### Hierarchical Processing and Meta-Learning\n- The concept of hierarchical processing can be combined with meta-learning by designing a meta-learner that adapts to different hierarchical attention mechanisms. For instance, a meta-learner can be trained to predict the most effective hierarchical attention strategy based on the input data and the current system status, similar to the approach in MetaInf, which optimizes inference acceleration methods based on historical data and system constraints.\n\n### Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n- Hierarchical attention mechanisms like those in H-Transformer-1D, which compute attention efficiently with linear complexity, can be integrated with meta-learning to dynamically adjust the attention scales based on the task requirements. This could involve training a meta-learner to select the optimal hierarchical attention configuration for different tasks or input sequences.\n\n## Adaptive Computation Strategies in Transformer Architectures\n\n### Dynamic Context Pruning and Hierarchical Merging\n- Techniques such as dynamic context pruning and hierarchical context merging can significantly reduce memory requirements and computational overhead. These methods can be adapted to work within a meta-learning framework, where the meta-learner decides when to apply these optimizations based on the input data and computational resources available.\n\n### Short-Long Convolutions and Linear Attention\n- Short-long convolutions with hardware-efficient linear attention (CHELA) offer a divide-and-conquer approach to attention computation, which can be integrated into a hierarchical transformer architecture. A meta-learner could be used to dynamically select the optimal convolution and attention strategies to balance computational overhead and model expressiveness.\n\n## Implementation Details of Meta-Learning in Hierarchical Models\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\n- Implementing meta-learning in hierarchical models requires hardware-aware designs to ensure real efficiency gains. This involves training the meta-learner to consider the specific characteristics of the hardware environment and adapt the hierarchical attention and computation strategies accordingly.\n\n### Efficient Memory Access Patterns\n- Efficient memory access patterns are crucial for the practical efficiency of hierarchical models. The meta-learner should be designed to optimize memory access patterns, such as through strategic context merging and tiling, to reduce memory requirements and improve performance.\n\n## Efficiency Considerations for Meta-Learning Integration\n\n### Trade-Offs Between Computational Overhead and Model Expressiveness\n- There is a trade-off between computational overhead and model expressiveness. The meta-learner should balance these factors by dynamically adjusting the hierarchical attention and computation strategies to optimize performance while minimizing computational costs.\n\n### Hybrid Approaches\n- Hybrid approaches combining different hierarchical processing techniques (e.g., H-Transformer-1D, HOMER, CHELA) can be explored. A meta-learner can be trained to select the best combination of these techniques based on the task and input data, ensuring optimal performance and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, integrating meta-learning with hierarchical transformers involves:\n\n- **Adaptive Hierarchical Attention**: Using meta-learning to dynamically select and adjust hierarchical attention mechanisms based on input data and system constraints.\n- **Efficient Computation Strategies**: Implementing techniques like dynamic context pruning, hierarchical context merging, and short-long convolutions, and using meta-learning to optimize their application.\n- **Hardware-Aware Designs**: Ensuring that the meta-learner considers hardware characteristics to optimize performance and efficiency.\n- **Balancing Computational Overhead and Expressiveness**: Using the meta-learner to balance the trade-offs between computational costs and model expressiveness.\n\nThese approaches can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and adaptive autoregressive language models.\n",

By combining these elements, we aim to create a model that dynamically adjusts to varying input complexities and tasks, optimizing resource utilization and improving model performance.\n\n3. **Problem Analysis**: \n   - **Parent 1 (MHLTransformer)**: Focuses on hierarchical multi-scale processing combined with linear attention and meta-learning strategies. It excels in capturing both local and global dependencies but lacks dynamic adaptability and efficient memory management.\n   - **Parent 2 (HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm)**: Introduces hierarchical and adaptive normalization to RMSNorm, enhancing efficiency and scalability but with increased complexity.\n   - Both parents offer unique advantages that can be synergistically combined to create a more efficient and scalable language model block.\n\n4. **Core Idea and Philosophy**: The core philosophy behind AHMLTransformer is to synergistically combine hierarchical multi-scale processing with adaptive mechanisms for dynamic context handling. By embedding linear attention within a hierarchical framework and leveraging meta-learning for on-the-fly adaptation, the model aims to efficiently process long sequences while adjusting to varying input complexities. The integration of adaptive state compression ensures that memory usage remains efficient, allowing the model to scale effectively.\n\n5. **Design Plan**:\n   - **Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms**: Implement hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture multi-scale dependencies and improve computational efficiency. Techniques like Weighted Grouped Query Attention and Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention can enhance the model's ability to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence.\n   - **Meta-Learning Strategies**: Integrate meta-learning strategies such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) and self-supervised meta-learning to enhance the adaptability of the model. These strategies allow the model to learn how to learn from new tasks and domains efficiently.\n   - **Memory Optimization Techniques**: Employ memory optimization techniques like FlashAttention and Dynamic Context Pruning to reduce computational complexity and optimize resource utilization. These techniques help manage the context size dynamically, essential for autoregressive models that need to process long sequences efficiently.\n\n6. **Implementation Guidelines**:\n   - **Pseudo-Code**:\n     ```python\n     class AHMLTransformerBlock(nn.Module):\n         def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_heads, ...):\n             super().__init__()\n             self.hierarchical_attention = HierarchicalAttention(embed_dim, num_heads, ...)\n             self.meta_learner = MetaLearner(embed_dim)\n             self.memory_optimizer = MemoryOptimizer(embed_dim)\n\n         def forward(self, x, **kwargs):\n             x = self.hierarchical_attention(x)\n             x = self.meta_learner(x)\n             x = self.memory_optimizer(x)\n             return x\n     ```\n   - **Mathematical Formulations**:\n     - **Hierarchical Attention**: \n       \n       \\[ \\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\text{softmax}\\left(\\frac{QK^T}{\\sqrt{d_k}}\\right)V \\]\n     - **Meta-Learning**: \n       \n       \\[ \\theta^* = \\arg\\min_\\theta \\mathcal{L}(\\theta; x) \\]\n     - **Memory Optimization**: \n       \n       \\[ \\text{Memory}(t) = \\text{Prune}(\\text{Memory}(t-1), \\text{Context}(t)) \\]\n\n7. **Research Summary**:\n   - **Key Search Queries**: meta-learning, hierarchical attention, memory optimization\n   - **Relevant Findings**: Integration of meta-learning strategies with hierarchical attention and memory optimization can significantly enhance the adaptability, efficiency, and scalability of language models.\n\n8. **Evolution of Design**:\n   - The design evolved through several stages, starting with the integration of hierarchical processing and adaptive normalization, followed by the incorporation of meta-learning strategies and memory optimization techniques.\n\n9. **Theoretical Analysis**:\n   - **Efficiency**: Hierarchical attention reduces computational load per token, and memory optimization techniques ensure efficient resource utilization.\n   - **Adaptability**: Meta-learning allows the model to adjust to varying contexts, improving performance on diverse data.\n   - **Memory Management**: Adaptive compression techniques ensure that memory usage scales sublinearly with sequence length.\n\n10. **Conclusion**: The Adaptive Hierarchical Meta-Learning Transformer (AHMLTransformer) leverages hierarchical attention mechanisms, meta-learning strategies, and memory optimization techniques to create a language model block that is efficient, scalable, and robust for long-sequence processing. By capturing dependencies at multiple scales, dynamically adapting to varying contexts, and efficiently managing memory, AHMLTransformer is expected to outperform current state-of-the-art models in terms of perplexity, accuracy on downstream tasks, and computational efficiency.\n\n11. **References**:\n   - Sun, Y., et al.
