These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory. ## 1 Introduction\n\nHandling long-range dependencies efficiently remains a core problem in sequence prediction/modelling. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) [Hop82, RHW ${ }^{+}$85, Elm90] are a natural choice, but are notoriously hard to train; they often suffer from vanishing and exploding gradients [BSF94, PMB13] and despite techniques to mitigate the issue [HS97, $\\mathrm{CVMG}^{+}$14, ASB16], they are also hard to scale given the inherently sequential nature of their computation. In recent years, transformer models $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17 have become the staple of sequence modelling, achieving remarkable success across multiple domains $\\left[\\mathrm{BMR}^{+}\\right.$20, $\\mathrm{DBK}^{+}$20, $\\mathrm{JEP}^{+}$21]. Transformer models are naturally parallelizable and hence scale significantly better than RNNs. However, attention layers have memory/computation requirements that scale quadratically with context length. Many approximations have been proposed (see [TDBM22] for a recent survey). RNNs have seen a recent resurgence in the form of state space models (SSM) which have shown promise in modelling long sequences across varied modalities GGR21, $\\mathrm{DFS}^{+}$22, GGB22, $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+} 23$, $\\mathrm{PMN}^{+}$23, GD23]. SSMs use linear dynamical systems (LDS) to model the sequence-to sequence transform by evolving the internal state of a dynamical system according to the dynamics equations\n\n$$\nx_{t}=A x_{t-1}+B u_{t} \\quad y_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is the hidden state of the dynamical system, $u_{t}$ is the input to the system, and $y_{t}$ are observations. The matrices $A, B, C, D$ govern the evolution of the system and are called system matrices. Despite its simplicity, this linear model can capture a rich set of natural dynamical systems\nin engineering and the physical sciences due to the potentially large number of hidden dimensions. Linear dynamical systems are also attractive as a sequence model because their structure is amenable to both fast inference and fast training via parallel scans [Ble89, SWL23] or convolutions [GGR21]. A rich literature stemming from control theory and recent machine learning interest has given rise to efficient techniques for system identification, filtering, and prediction for linear dynamical systems. For a survey of recent literature see [HS22]. These techniques make SSMs attractive for sequence tasks which inherently depend on long contexts that scale poorly for transformers. Examples include large language models [DFS ${ }^{+}$22], modelling time series [ZSP ${ }^{+}$23], and audio generation [GGDR22]. To understand the factors affecting the memory in an SSM or simply a linear dynamical system, we now proceed to delineate how past states and inputs affect the future. Geometric decay in LDS. The linear equations governing the dynamics are recursive in nature, and imply that in a noiseless environment, the $t$ 'th output can be written as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=C x_{t}+D u_{t}=C\\left(A x_{t-1}+B u_{t}\\right)+D u_{t}=\\ldots=\\sum_{i=0}^{t-1} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+D u_{t}\n$$\n\nThe matrix $A$ is asymmetric in general, and can have complex eigenvalues. If the amplitude of these eigenvalues is $>1$, then the output $y_{t}$ can grow without bounds. This is called an \"explosive\" system. In a well-behaved system, the eigenvalues of $A$ have magnitude $<1$. If the magnitudes are bounded away from 1 , say $\\left|\\lambda_{i}(A)\\right|<1-\\delta$, for some $\\delta>0$ (referred to as spectral gap), then we can write\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} C A^{i} B u_{t-i}+\\omega_{k},\\left\\|\\omega_{k}\\right\\| \\leq \\varepsilon\n$$\n\nfor $k=O\\left(\\frac{1}{\\delta} \\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\\right)$. This mathematical fact implies that the effective memory of the system is on the order of $\\frac{1}{\\delta}$. In general, the parameter $\\delta$ is unknown apriori and can get arbitrarily small as we approach systems with have long range dependencies leading to instability in training linear dynamical systems with a long context. This issue is specifically highlighted in the work of [ $\\mathrm{OSG}^{+}$23] who observe that on long range tasks learning an LDS directly does not succeed and requires interventions such as stable exponential parameterizations and specific normalization which have been repeatedly used either implicitly or explicitly in the SSM literature [GGR21]. Unfortunately these reparametrizations and normalizations come with no theoretical guarantees. In fact this limitation is generally known to be fundamental to the use of linear dynamical systems, and can only be circumvented via a significant increase in sample complexity $\\left[\\mathrm{GLS}^{+}\\right.$20] or via control over the input sequence [SMT ${ }^{+}$18]. Spectral filtering for linear dynamical systems. A notable deviation from the standard theory of linear dynamical systems that allows efficient learning in the presence of arbitrarily long memory is the technique of spectral filtering [HSZ17]. The idea is to project the sequence of inputs to a small subspace that is constructed using special structure of discrete LDS where successive powers of the system matrix appear in the impulse response function. The basic idea is to represent the output as\n\n$$\ny_{t}=\\sum_{j=1}^{k} M_{j}\\left(\\sum_{i} \\phi_{j}(i) \\cdot u_{t-i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\phi_{j}$ are spectral filters which are sequence-length sized vectors that given the target sequence length can be computed offline, and $M_{j}$ are matrices parameterizing the model. These spectral-filters are the eigenvectors of the matrix constructed as the average of outer products of the discrete impulseresponse functions, viz $Z=\\int_{0}^{1}\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]^{\\top} d \\alpha$. It is shown that this matrix is inherently low-dimensional and for all $\\alpha \\in[0,1]$, vectors of the form $\\left[1, \\alpha, \\alpha^{2} \\ldots\\right]$ are well approximated by the top-eigenspace of Z. Figure 1 depicts these filters. For the details of how these filters are derived and their computation, see Section 2\n\nWhy is spectral filtering important? The main advantage of spectral filtering is that for certain types of linear dynamical systems, in particular those with symmetric matrices $A$, the effective memory(measured by the number of filters) required to represent an observation at any point in the sequence in the spectral basis is independent of the spectral gap parameter $\\delta!$. This guarantee indicates that if we featurize the input into the spectral basis, we can potentially design models that\nare capable of efficiently and stably representing systems with extremely long memory even with $\\delta \\rightarrow 0$. This striking fact motivates our derivation of the recurrent spectral architecture, and is the underlying justification for the performance and training stability gains we see in experiments. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_28085b3c06af8ebfb6a7g-03.jpg?height=524&width=816&top_left_y=429&top_left_x=641)\n\nFigure 1: Spectral Filters used by the Spectral Filtering Algorithm. The x-axis is the time domain. ### 1.1 Our Contributions\n\nWe start by proposing state space models with learned components that apply spectral filtering for their featurization. We consider two types of spectral filters, which augment the original spectral filters proposed in HSZ17] with negative eigenvalues in two different ways. Our main contribution is a neural architecture that is based on these spectral state space models. This neural architecture can be applied recursively in layers, resulting in an expressive architecture for modeling sequential data. Finally we implement this neural architecture and apply it towards synthetically generated data as well as the Long Range Arena benchmark [TDA ${ }^{+21]}$. We demonstrate that spectral state space models can stably and more efficiently learn on sequence modelling tasks with long range dependencies without the need for exponential parameterizations, particular initializations and normalizations. Main Advantages of Spectral SSM. Previously proposed convolutional models for sequence modeling, surveyed in the related work section, learn the kernels from the data. The kernels used in Spectral SSM are theoretically-founded and fixed and thus parameter-free. In addition, our models are provably as expressive as an LDS. In particular, their expressiveness neither depends on the spectra gap nor on the dimension of the system, which are necessary in all other methods. ### 1.2 Related work\n\nDue to limited space, we provide a short overview of the most related work to us below and provide a detailed report on the related work in the appendix (Section A). State space models. SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years starting with the works [GDE $\\left.{ }^{+} 20\\right],\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ which propose and develop the HiPPO theory. [GGR21] develop the S4 parameterization to address the bottlenecks of training efficiency, performance and numberical stability. The $S 4$ parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization. The S 4 model was further streamlined in later works, viz. using diagonal system matrices without a loss in performance [GGB22] and the S5 model [SWL23] which uses a MIMO diagonal system and associative scans for computational efficiency. [OSG $\\left.{ }^{+} 23\\right]$ investigate whether simpler deep Linear Recurrent Units (LRU) can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer under the crucial caveat that specific modifications on linear RNNs, namely the stable exponential parameterization, $\\gamma$ - normalization and ring initialization, are necessary to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/31 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n# Spectral State Space Models \n\nNaman Agarwal<br>Google Deepmind<br>namanagarwal@google.com\n\nDaniel Suo<br>Google Deepmind\n\nXinyi Chen<br>Princeton University<br>Google Deepmind\n\nElad Hazan<br>Princeton University<br>Google Deepmind\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nThis paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Given that many of these applications produce exceedingly long sequences, sequential models need to capture long-range temporal dependencies in order to yield accurate predictions. To this end, many specialized deep learning methods have been developed to deal with long sequences, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [2, 7, 13, 30, 14, 28], convolutional neural networks (CNNs) [4, 29], continuous-time models (CTMs) $[18,37]$, and transformers $[21,8,23,39,26]$. Over the past few years, the new class of state-space models (SSMs) gained vast popularity for sequential modeling due to their outstanding performance on the Long-Range Arena (LRA)\n\n[^0]dataset [33]. An SSM is built upon a continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) dynamical system $\\Sigma=(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{D})$, which is a system of linear ODEs given by\n\\[\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{x}^{\\prime}(t) & =\\mathbf{A x}(t)+\\mathbf{B u}(t) \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}(t) & =\\mathbf{C x}(t)+\\mathbf{D u}(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\\]\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times n}, \\mathbf{B} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n \\times m}, \\mathbf{C} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p \\times n}, \\mathbf{D} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p \\times m}$ are the state, input, output and feedthrough matrices; and $\\mathbf{u}(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{m}, \\mathbf{x}(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{n}, \\mathbf{y}(t) \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ are the inputs, states, and outputs of the system, respectively. The system can be discretized at time steps $j \\Delta t$, where $\\Delta t>0$ and $j=1, \\ldots, L$, to be fed with sequential inputs of length $L$. To store and process the information of the long sequential inputs online, the SSMs are often initialized by a pre-designed LTI system. One of the most popular schemes is called \"HiPPO initialization\" [35, 15], in which the Legendre coefficients of the input history at time $t$, i.e., $\\mathbf{u} \\cdot \\mathbb{1}_{[0, t]}$, are stored and updated in the state vector $\\mathbf{x}(t)$. This initialization is specifically designed to model long-range dependencies in sequential data. The recently proposed S4 model [17] leverages the HiPPO initialization and accelerates training and inference by decomposing $\\mathbf{A}$ into the sum of a diagonal matrix and a low-rank one. The diagonal-plus-low-rank (DPLR) structure yields a barycentric representation [1] of the transfer function of eq. (1) that maps inputs to outputs in the frequency domain, enabling fast computation in the frequency domain [3]. While the DPLR structure achieves an asymptotic speed-up of the model, considering A to be a diagonal matrix results in a simpler structure. Compared to a DPLR matrix A, a diagonal SSM is not only faster to compute and easier to implement, but it also allows integrating channel communication via parallel scans [32], thereby improving its performance on long-range tasks. Unfortunately, the problem of diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is exponentially illconditioned, as $n$ increases. Hence, while [17] shows analytic forms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of HiPPO matrices, they suffer from an exponentially large variance and cannot be used in practice. So far, the most popular way of obtaining a diagonal SSM is to simply discard the low-rank part from the DPLR structure, leveraging a stable diagonalization algorithm for a normal matrix. Discarding the low-rank component changes the underlying diagonalization problem, however; and it abandons the theoretical insights about HiPPO. Still, the resulting model almost matches S4's performance, in practice. Such diagonal models are called S4D [16] when the systems are single-input/single-output (i.e., $m=p=1$ ) and S5 [32] when the systems are multiple-input/multiple-output (i.e., $m=p>1$ ), which enables channel communication. The issue of ill-posed diagonalization problems is not merely specific to SSMs. For example, it is known that non-normal matrices make RNNs more expressive [22, 27]. More generally, non-normality plays an important role in the training of certain neural networks [31, 25]. While the ill-posedness of the diagonalization problem essentially prevents accurate computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors (i.e., we cannot have a small forward error) - in fact, the true spectral information becomes meaningless in this case - using a backward stable eigensolver, one can recover the non-normal matrix accurately (i.e., we can have a small backward error) from the wrong eigenvalues and eigenvectors. In this paper, we propose a generic \"perturb-then-diagonalize\" (PTD) methodology as a backward stable eigensolver. PTD is based on the idea that a small random perturbation remedies the problem of the blowing up of eigenvector condition number $[11,10,6]$, regularizing the ill-posed problem into a close but well-posed one. It is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators [34] and may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices. In the context of SSMs, our PTD method can be used to diagonalize the highly non-normal HiPPO framework. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Our method is flexible, and it can be used to diagonalize many SSM initialization schemes that may be invented in the future. Contribution. Here are our main contributions:\n\n1. We propose a \"perturb-then-diagonalize\" (PTD) methodology that solves ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning when only the backward error is important.\n```\n\n#### 3.

A core component of S4 involves initializing the SSM state matrix to a particular matrix called a HiPPO matrix, which was empirically important for S4's ability to handle long sequences. However, the specific matrix that S4 uses was actually derived in previous work for a particular time-varying dynamical system, and the use of this matrix as a time-invariant SSM had no known mathematical interpretation. Consequently, the theoretical mechanism by which S4 models long-range dependencies actually remains unexplained. We derive a more general and intuitive formulation of the HiPPO framework, which provides a simple mathematical interpretation of S4 as a decomposition onto exponentially-warped Legendre polynomials, explaining its ability to capture long dependencies. Our generalization introduces a theoretically rich class of SSMs that also lets us derive more intuitive S4 variants for other bases such as the Fourier basis, and explains other aspects of training S4, such as how to initialize the important timescale parameter. These insights improve S4's performance to 86% on the Long Range Arena benchmark, with 96% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\nGovernment. ## References\n\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Models for Irregularly-Sampled Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: spectral state space models normalization techniques*\n\n*Abdul Fatir Ansari, Alvin Heng, Andre Lim, Harold Soh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations and proposes three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning accurate predictive models of real-world dynamic phenomena (e.g., climate, biological) remains a challenging task. One key issue is that the data generated by both natural and artificial processes often comprise time series that are irregularly sampled and/or contain missing observations. In this work, we propose the Neural Continuous-Discrete State Space Model (NCDSSM) for continuous-time modeling of time series through discrete-time observations. NCDSSM employs auxiliary variables to disentangle recognition from dynamics, thus requiring amortized inference only for the auxiliary variables. Leveraging techniques from continuous-discrete filtering theory, we demonstrate how to perform accurate Bayesian inference for the dynamic states. We propose three flexible parameterizations of the latent dynamics and an efficient training objective that marginalizes the dynamic states during inference. Empirical results on multiple benchmark datasets across various domains show improved imputation and forecasting performance of NCDSSM over existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. StableSSM: Alleviating the Curse of Memory in State-space Models through Stable Reparameterization\n\n*From Search Query: spectral state space models normalization techniques*\n\n*Shida Wang, Qianxiao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations and illustrates that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we investigate the long-term memory learning capabilities of state-space models (SSMs) from the perspective of parameterization. We prove that state-space models without any reparameterization exhibit a memory limitation similar to that of traditional RNNs: the target relationships that can be stably approximated by state-space models must have an exponential decaying memory. Our analysis identifies this\"curse of memory\"as a result of the recurrent weights converging to a stability boundary, suggesting that a reparameterization technique can be effective. To this end, we introduce a class of reparameterization techniques for SSMs that effectively lift its memory limitations. Besides improving approximation capabilities, we further illustrate that a principled choice of reparameterization scheme can also enhance optimization stability. We validate our findings using synthetic datasets, language models and image classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

However, even with numerous recent developments, the CT nonlinear state-space (NL-SS) model identification problem remains to be solved in full, considering common experimental aspects such as the presence of external inputs, measurement noise, latent states, and general robustness. This paper presents a novel estimation method that addresses all these aspects and that can obtain state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks with compact fully connected neural networks capturing the CT dynamics. The proposed estimation method called the subspace encoder approach (SUBNET) ascertains these results by efficiently approximating the complete simulation loss by evaluating short simulations on subsections of the data, by using an encoder function to estimate the initial state for each subsection and a novel state-derivative normalization to ensure stability and good numerical conditioning of the training process. We prove that the use of subsections increases cost function smoothness together with the necessary requirements for the existence of the encoder function and we show that the proposed state-derivative normalization is essential for reliable estimation of CT NL-SS models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: spectral state space models normalization techniques*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: spectral state space models normalization techniques*\n\n*Raunaq M. Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

This can obscure important time-invariant features. The proposed method operates in the frequency domain, adaptively up-weighting key frequency components and suppressing unstable ones. This approach could be adapted to state space models in language models to improve stability and capture dynamic patterns more effectively.\n\n### Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (SPOD)\nSPOD, discussed in the AIAA Journal, involves decomposing data into modes based on spectral analysis. This method is particularly useful for identifying structures in data that vary over time and frequency. Integrating SPOD into state space models could help in capturing multi-scale features and improving the model's ability to handle long-range dependencies and dynamic patterns.\n\n## Advanced Normalization Techniques\n\n### Spectral Normalization\nThe work on \"Normalizing self-supervised learning for provably reliable Change Point Detection\" uses spectral normalization (SN) to improve the reliability and performance of deep representation learning. SN can be applied to language models to ensure that the embeddings are highly informative and stable, which is crucial for maintaining consistent performance across different inputs and contexts.\n\n### Timestep Normalization and Exponential Moving Averages\nThe \"MEGALODON\" paper introduces timestep normalization layers and complex exponential moving averages (CEMA) to enhance stability and performance. These techniques can be integrated into the state space models of autoregressive language models to improve training dynamics and stability. Timestep normalization can help in reducing the impact of time-dependent variations, while CEMA can provide a smoother and more stable update mechanism.\n\n## Efficiency and Stability Improvements\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\nCombining linear attention with spectral methods can offer a balance between efficiency and effectiveness. For instance, using spectral analysis to identify key frequency components can help in focusing attention on the most relevant parts of the input sequence, thus improving both stability and efficiency.\n\n### Memory-Efficient State Management\nThe use of hybrid state management, combining fixed and adaptive components, can help in balancing state size and recall ability. Techniques like state compression and efficient memory usage, as mentioned in the analysis, can be enhanced by incorporating spectral methods to better manage and update contextual information.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n- **Frequency Domain Normalization**: Adaptively up-weighting stable frequency components can improve the model's ability to capture dynamic patterns and enhance stability.\n- **Spectral Proper Orthogonal Decomposition**: This method can help in identifying and capturing multi-scale features, which is beneficial for handling long-range dependencies in language models.\n- **Spectral Normalization**: Ensures that embeddings are highly informative and stable, which is crucial for consistent performance.\n- **Advanced Normalization Techniques**: Timestep normalization and exponential moving averages can enhance stability and performance in state space models.\n\nBy integrating these spectral methods and advanced normalization techniques, researchers can potentially improve the stability, efficiency, and overall performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/25 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nWe also noticed fluctuations in the 5-shot MCQ tasks, with an average MCQ score of around $26.5 \\%$. ## 5. Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

Our H-Transformer-1D model uses the standard Transformer decoder implementation in Flax as the backbone. Only the attention is replaced with our hierarchical attention. We trained both the Transformer baseline and H Transformer-1D on the One-Billion Word benchmark (Chelba et al., 2014). We tried different $N_{r}$ (numerical rank) in our H -Transformer-1D model. These represent different inductive bias. We found that H -Transformer-1D with $N_{r}=16$ generated\n\n[^4]text with quality comparable to that of the baseline Transformer. For both Transformer baseline and H -Transformer-1D, we also tried two sets of model parameters: 1) embedding size is 512 and feed-forward module size is 2048 and hence the parameter count is 53 M ; 2) embedding size is 1024 and feed-forward module size is 4096 and hence the parameter count is 144 M . The test perplexity results of these four models and various SOTA models are shown in table 2. H-Transformer-1D delivers the lowest perplexity to-date while using $5 \\times$ smaller model capacity than that of the previous SOTA model Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019). This is another strong evidence to support our hypothesis in section 5.1 and validate the inductive bias due to the\nhierarchical attention. ## 9 Conclusions and Future Work\n\nWe have proposed a new Transformer attention using the inductive bias inspired by the H Matrix. The new algorithm has linear complexity in run time and memory usage and is fully compatible with dense linear algebra libraries on GPU and TPU. The effectiveness of this new attention is demonstrated by the empirical evidences from long-range arena benchmark and One-Billion word language modeling. Future work include applying the new attention to music and genomics, developing proper inductive bias for cross-attention and extending to 2D images. ## References\n\nJader Abreu, Luis Fred, David Mac\u00eado, and C.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/34 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\n(11) and (12) is generally unknown. So gathering empirical evidences seems the only viable path to answer the first question listed above. The ablation studies by (Khandelwal et al., 2018) examine the effect of context words on a language model. Within the context range of about 200 tokens, word order is only relevant within the 20 most recent tokens or about a sentence. In the long-range context, order has almost no effect on performance, suggesting that the model maintains a high-level, rough semantic representation of faraway words. The observation is succinctly summarized by the title of the paper \"sharp nearby, fuzzy far away\". Remarkably, this is in spirit very close to the key insight into the Multilevel Methods. A few recent attention-related studies have explored this direction with some success, such as word-level and sentence-level attentions in (Miculicich et al., 2018; Abreu et al., 2019), and sentence-level and paragraph-level attentions in (Liu and Lapata, 2019). Even though the proposed hierarchical attention in these studies only has two levels, as opposed to ten or more levels typically used by the Multilevel Methods, the reported positive results are quite suggestive. We therefore hypothesize that the same hierarchical low-rank structure as shown in Eq (13) might also hold for the attention matrix in many NLP tasks. And we treat it as the inductive bias in the hierarchical attention mechanism proposed in this paper. As pointed out in (Goyal and Bengio, 2020), inductive biases encourage the learning algorithm to prioritise solutions with certain properties. Hence good benchmark performance delivered by a Transformer-based model with proposed hierarchical attention can be regarded as a positive evidence to support the hierarchical low-rank structure hypothesis. ### 5.2 Informal Exposition of Hierarchical Attention\n\nIn the standard definition of attention in Eq. (3) and (4), there is no preference given to any keys based on the sequence distance between a query and keys. The observation in (Khandelwal et al.,\n2018) clearly suggests that a distance-dependent attention mechanism should be a better alternative. We will take three steps to informally explain the hierarchical attention mechanism. First, the attention matrix blocks for nearby, mid-distance and long-distance attention are separated in section 5.2.1. This is the first step toward the distance-dependent attention mentioned above. Second, a token hierarchy is established in section 5.2.2. Third, the hierarchical attention is constructed in section 5.2.3\n\n### 5.2.1 Attention Partition\n\nConsider a 16-word sentence in Fig. 1. The sentence is partitioned at three segment granularity. This induces a three-level partition of the attention matrix $A$ for the original sequence:\n\n$$\nA=A^{(2)}+A^{(1)}+A^{(0)}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nA^{(2)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c}\n0 & A_{12}^{(2)} \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(2)} & 0\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a848c33bf30dfbc079beg-05.jpg?height=258&width=600&top_left_y=1539&top_left_x=291)\n\n$$\nA^{(0)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{c|c|c|c|c}\nA_{11}^{(0)} & A_{12}^{(0)} & & & \\\\\n\\hline A_{21}^{(0)} & A_{22}^{(0)} & A_{23}^{(0)} & & \\\\\n\\hline & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\n\\hline & & & A_{87}^{(0)} & A_{88}^{(0)}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the nonzero entries in $A^{(0)}, A^{(1)}$ and $A^{(2)}$ are the same as the corresponding entries of matrix $A$ in Eq.\n```\n\n#### 4. Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.39)\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 86  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/epfml/landmark-attention/.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/32 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nThe points marked with a red cross represent cases where the model ran out of memory. Points marked with a green star use a more efficient inference mechanism (see Section G). Inference is done by feeding the segment in windows of length 250 tokens (excluding the inserted landmark tokens). The top $k=4$ landmarked blocks are retrieved. Retrieval accuracy is measured for a fixed total prompt length, by using the suffix and prefix filler. Results are averaged over 50 random generation of the pass key (a random number between 1 and 50000), which each time is located at a random position in the full-length prompt. The space before and after the pass key is filled accordingly by the suffix and prefix filler. The gray box marks the region where the prompt length is within lengths used during original LLaMA training. attention to far tokens which defeats our purpose. While we briefly discuss a possible solution for models with landmark tokens in Appendix E, we leave a more thorough investigation as future work. We note that once such method is developed, it can be directly combined with landmark tokens, yielding inference capabilities at any length. Hierarchical Landmarks. In large-scale settings, the landmark tokens can be stored in k-nearest neighbor data structures to improve retrieval performance and reduce memory usage. However, an alternative is to introduce hierarchy with higher level landmark tokens controlling the attention to lower level landmarks. In Appendix D, we investigate adding a special token which acts as a gate to all landmark tokens. This token can for example be used to decide whether a retrieval is necessary. Similarly, this token can be used at different memory cache levels where high attention to this token would constitute a cache miss, leading to lookup in lower-level (and slower) caches. We leave exploration of possible hierarchical landmark tokens as a future direction. Training with Cache. For simplicity, in this work we focus on using the standard training procedure. While we expect the standard softmax mechanism to closely resemble the retrieval at inference, given the special indexing scheme, it is possible that the model would gain additional benefit from incorporating the cache during training. We leave investigation of such training variants as a future work. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this work presents a novel method for training attention to retrieve relevant blocks from memory. Unlike previous methods that rely on recurrence to create memory, our approach enables direct access to previous tokens, ensuring accurate information retrieval without the problem of slowly forgetting past data. We have demonstrated that our method achieves comparable performance to recurrent methods such as Transformer-XL while utilizing less computational resources. Additionally, our attention-based retrieval process allows for tracking and interpretability, providing insights into the information used to generate the output. Importantly, our results highlight the ability of our approach to handle significantly longer context lengths than those encountered during training. Moreover, we have shown that this capability can efficiently be incorporated into existing pre-trained models through fine-tuning, showcasing improved retrieval capabilities in the LLaMA 7B language model. Overall, our method enables efficient inference with arbitrary context lengths, making it suitable for accessing large inputs and processing fine-grained information within the large context. ## Acknowledgment\n\nThe authors would like to express their gratitude to Matteo Pagliardini for insightful discussions and Olivia Simin Fan for their invaluable feedback on initial drafts of this paper.

Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Yubo Chen, Hang Yang, Kang Liu, Jun Zhao, Yantao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively and a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information to solve the two problems simultaneously.\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3. History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

MultiHiertt: Numerical Reasoning over Multi Hierarchical Tabular and Textual Data\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Yilun Zhao, Yunxiang Li, Chenying Li, Rui Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new large-scale benchmark, MultiHiertt, with QA pairs over Multi Hierarchical Tabular and Textual data is constructed and a novel QA model termed MT2Net is introduced, which first applies facts retrieving to extract relevant supporting facts from both tables and text and then uses a reasoning module to perform symbolic reasoning over retrieved facts.\n\n**Abstract:** Numerical reasoning over hybrid data containing both textual and tabular content (e.g., financial reports) has recently attracted much attention in the NLP community. However, existing question answering (QA) benchmarks over hybrid data only include a single flat table in each document and thus lack examples of multi-step numerical reasoning across multiple hierarchical tables. To facilitate data analytical progress, we construct a new large-scale benchmark, MultiHiertt, with QA pairs over Multi Hierarchical Tabular and Textual data. MultiHiertt is built from a wealth of financial reports and has the following unique characteristics: 1) each document contain multiple tables and longer unstructured texts; 2) most of tables contained are hierarchical; 3) the reasoning process required for each question is more complex and challenging than existing benchmarks; and 4) fine-grained annotations of reasoning processes and supporting facts are provided to reveal complex numerical reasoning. We further introduce a novel QA model termed MT2Net, which first applies facts retrieving to extract relevant supporting facts from both tables and text and then uses a reasoning module to perform symbolic reasoning over retrieved facts. We conduct comprehensive experiments on various baselines. The experimental results show that MultiHiertt presents a strong challenge for existing baselines whose results lag far behind the performance of human experts.

Lightweight Image Super-Resolution with Information Multi-distillation Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Zheng Hui, Yunchu Yang, Xiumei Wang, Xinbo Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, single image super-resolution (SISR) methods using deep convolution neural network (CNN) have achieved impressive results. Thanks to the powerful representation capabilities of the deep networks, numerous previous ways can learn the complex non-linear mapping between low-resolution (LR) image patches and their high-resolution (HR) versions. However, excessive convolutions will limit the application of super-resolution technology in low computing power devices. Besides, super-resolution of any arbitrary scale factor is a critical issue in practical applications, which has not been well solved in the previous approaches. To address these issues, we propose a lightweight information multi-distillation network (IMDN) by constructing the cascaded information multi-distillation blocks (IMDB), which contains distillation and selective fusion parts. Specifically, the distillation module extracts hierarchical features step-by-step, and fusion module aggregates them according to the importance of candidate features, which is evaluated by the proposed contrast-aware channel attention mechanism. To process real images with any sizes, we develop an adaptive cropping strategy (ACS) to super-resolve block-wise image patches using the same well-trained model. Extensive experiments suggest that the proposed method performs favorably against the state-of-the-art SR algorithms in term of visual quality, memory footprint, and inference time.

Learning to Aggregate Multi-Scale Context for Instance Segmentation in Remote Sensing Images\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Yan Luo, Chang Wen Chen, Shuang Luo, Chao Hu, Huifang Li, Ye Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The task of instance segmentation in remote sensing images, aiming at performing per-pixel labeling of objects at instance level, is of great importance for various civil applications. Despite previous successes, most existing instance segmentation methods designed for natural images encounter sharp performance degradations when they are directly applied to top-view remote sensing images. Through careful analysis, we observe that the challenges mainly come from the lack of discriminative object features due to severe scale variations, low contrasts, and clustered distributions. In order to address these problems, a novel context aggregation network (CATNet) is proposed to improve the feature extraction process. The proposed model exploits three lightweight plug-and-play modules, namely dense feature pyramid network (DenseFPN), spatial context pyramid (SCP), and hierarchical region of interest extractor (HRoIE), to aggregate global visual context at feature, spatial, and instance domains, respectively. DenseFPN is a multi-scale feature propagation module that establishes more flexible information flows by adopting inter-level residual connections, cross-level dense connections, and feature re-weighting strategy. Leveraging the attention mechanism, SCP further augments the features by aggregating global spatial context into local regions. For each instance, HRoIE adaptively generates RoI features for different downstream tasks. Extensive evaluations of the proposed scheme on iSAID, DIOR, NWPU VHR-10, and HRSID datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-arts under similar computational costs.

Continuous-Time Deep Glioma Growth Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention mechanisms multi-scale processing*\n\n*Klaus H.

J\u00e4ger, Gregor K\u00f6hler, Fabian Isensee, Jens Petersen*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability to estimate how a tumor might evolve in the future could have tremendous clinical benefits, from improved treatment decisions to better dose distribution in radiation therapy. Recent work has approached the glioma growth modeling problem via deep learning and variational inference, thus learning growth dynamics entirely from a real patient data distribution. So far, this approach was constrained to predefined image acquisition intervals and sequences of fixed length, which limits its applicability in more realistic scenarios. We overcome these limitations by extending Neural Processes, a class of conditional generative models for stochastic time series, with a hierarchical multi-scale representation encoding including a spatio-temporal attention mechanism. The result is a learned growth model that can be conditioned on an arbitrary number of observations, and that can produce a distribution of temporally consistent growth trajectories on a continuous time axis. On a dataset of 379 patients, the approach successfully captures both global and finer-grained variations in the images, exhibiting superior performance compared to other learned growth models.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hierarchical attention mechanisms, multi-scale processing, memory efficiency, and computational complexity, here are some key insights and implementations:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\nHierarchical attention mechanisms are crucial for capturing the complex structure of data, such as documents or sentences, at multiple scales.\n\n- **Hierarchical Attention Networks (HAN):** These models use a dual attention mechanism, with word-level and sentence-level attention. This allows the model to weigh the importance of words within sentences and sentences within documents, providing a nuanced understanding of the data.\n- **Multi-scale Attention:** In hierarchical networks, multi-scale attention can be integrated to focus on different levels of granularity. For example, models like H2Former and SegFormer use multi-scale channel attention within their encoders to capture features at various scales.\n\n## Multi-scale Processing\n\nMulti-scale processing is essential for capturing both local and global features in the data.\n\n- **Global and Local Attention:** A hybrid approach combining global and local attention mechanisms can be effective. Global attention captures long-range dependencies and provides a holistic view, while local attention focuses on detailed features. This combination ensures that the model leverages both detailed local features and overarching global context.\n- **Scale-specific Attention:** Models like LiGAR use scale-specific attention mechanisms to focus on spatiotemporal patterns at different granularity levels, which can be adapted for language models to handle different temporal scales or contextual levels.\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Computational Complexity\n\nTo achieve memory efficiency and reduce computational complexity, several strategies can be employed:\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing:** Hierarchical architectures can better capture multi-scale patterns while reducing the computational load by processing information at different levels. This approach can help in balancing memory efficiency and expressiveness.\n- **Spectral Methods:** Integrating spectral methods, such as spectral state space models (SSMs), can provide theoretical guarantees for robustness and handle long-range dependencies more efficiently without the need for learning complex filters. This can reduce the computational complexity and improve memory efficiency[Analysis Note: Spectral Methods and Normalization in LM Design].\n- **Linear Attention with Spectral Components:** Using linear attention mechanisms combined with spectral components can offer a better balance between state size and recall ability, which is crucial for memory-efficient models[Analysis Note: Spectral Methods and Normalization in LM Design].\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Code Example:** Implementing hierarchical attention mechanisms can be done using layers that compute attention scores at multiple levels.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 4. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.17)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/29 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\n2024.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hierarchical attention implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hierarchical attention implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Yet, the rapid development of the field poses several challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion of methods to compare, limited transparency and consensus on best practices, as well as tedious re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often very partial, which can lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the progress of research. We propose Benchopt, a collaborative framework to automate, reproduce and publish optimization benchmarks in machine learning across programming languages and hardware architectures. Benchopt simplifies benchmarking for the community by providing an off-the-shelf tool for running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate its broad usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks: $\\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18 training for image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical findings that give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems, showing that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details.

Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient hierarchical attention implementation hardware optimization*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

This approach is particularly useful for handling long sequences and diverse syntax, which can be adapted to other domains beyond assembly code.\n\n### Hierarchical Structure in Transformers\nThe concept of Hierarchy Transformer encoders (HiTs) involves re-training transformer encoder-based LMs to explicitly encode hierarchical structures using hyperbolic space. This method can help in capturing and interpreting hierarchical relationships more effectively, which is crucial for understanding complex sequences.\n\n### Hierarchical Multi-label Text Classification\nThis approach uses a hierarchical attention strategy to capture associations between texts and hierarchical structures. It demonstrates how hierarchical attention can be applied to classify texts within a hierarchical taxonomy, which can be generalized to other hierarchical processing tasks.\n\n## Hardware Optimization and Efficient Memory Access\n\n### Tiling and Divide-and-Conquer Strategies\nImplementations like CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention) and Lightning Attention-2 leverage tiling and divide-and-conquer techniques to optimize attention computation. These methods separate the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, effectively utilizing GPU hardware and reducing the challenges associated with cumulative summation[Analysis Note].\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nBlock-based processing improves cache utilization and reduces the memory footprint. This is evident in the H-Transformer-1D, which exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) to achieve linear run time and memory complexity[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nHardware-aware optimizations are crucial for real performance gains. For instance, the hierarchical attention mechanism in H-Transformer-1D is designed with hardware efficiency in mind, ensuring that the model can capture hierarchical structures while maintaining efficient computational and memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Memory Access Patterns\n\n### Hierarchical Structures\nHierarchical structures can significantly reduce the memory footprint by organizing data in a way that minimizes unnecessary memory accesses. The HiTs model, for example, uses hyperbolic clustering and centripetal losses to organize entities hierarchically, which can be beneficial for memory efficiency.\n\n### Cache Utilization\nBlock-based processing, as mentioned, improves cache utilization. This is particularly important for attention mechanisms, as it ensures that the model can access relevant information efficiently without excessive memory accesses[Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration Strategies\n\n### Combining Local and Global Processing\nCombining local and global processing through hierarchical structures can capture multi-scale patterns effectively. This is demonstrated in the Nova model, where intra-instruction, preceding-instruction, and inter-instruction attention mechanisms work together to capture both local and global semantics.\n\n### Test-Time Training Integration\nIntegrating hierarchical processing with test-time training can further enhance the model's adaptability and performance. This involves fine-tuning the hierarchical attention mechanisms during inference to better handle varying sequence lengths and contexts[Analysis Note].\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of hardware utilization and memory access but also more effective in capturing complex hierarchical structures within the data.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Yet, the rapid development of the field poses several challenges: researchers are confronted with a profusion of methods to compare, limited transparency and consensus on best practices, as well as tedious re-implementation work. As a result, validation is often very partial, which can lead to wrong conclusions that slow down the progress of research. We propose Benchopt, a collaborative framework to automate, reproduce and publish optimization benchmarks in machine learning across programming languages and hardware architectures. Benchopt simplifies benchmarking for the community by providing an off-the-shelf tool for running, sharing and extending experiments. To demonstrate its broad usability, we showcase benchmarks on three standard learning tasks: $\\ell_2$-regularized logistic regression, Lasso, and ResNet18 training for image classification. These benchmarks highlight key practical findings that give a more nuanced view of the state-of-the-art for these problems, showing that for practical evaluation, the devil is in the details. We hope that Benchopt will foster collaborative work in the community hence improving the reproducibility of research findings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

By removing carefully chosen structures, e.g., neurons or attention heads, the improvements from this approach can be realized on standard deep learning hardware. In this work, we focus on structured pruning in the one-shot (post-training) setting, which does not require model retraining after pruning. We propose a novel combinatorial optimization framework for this problem, based on a layer-wise reconstruction objective and a careful reformulation that allows for scalable optimization. Moreover, we design a new local combinatorial optimization algorithm, which exploits low-rank updates for efficient local search. Our framework is time and memory-efficient and considerably improves upon state-of-the-art one-shot methods on vision models (e.g., ResNet50, MobileNet) and language models (e.g., OPT-1.3B -- OPT-30B). For language models, e.g., OPT-2.7B, OSSCAR can lead to $125\\times$ lower test perplexity on WikiText with $2\\times$ inference time speedup in comparison to the state-of-the-art ZipLM approach.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Recently, deep SNNs have shown breathtaking performance improvement through cutting-edge training strategy and \ufb02exi-ble structure, which also scales up the number of parameters and computational burdens in a single network. Inspired by the state transition of dendritic spines in the \ufb01lopodial model of spinogen-esis, we model different states of SNN weights, facilitating weight optimization for pruning. Furthermore, the pruning speed can be regulated by using different functions describing the growing threshold of state transition. We organize these techniques as a dynamic pruning algorithm based on nonlinear reparameterization mapping from spine size to SNN weights. Our approach yields sparse deep networks on the large-scale dataset (SEW ResNet18 on ImageNet) while maintaining state-of-the-art low performance loss ( \u223c 3% at 88.8% sparsity) compared to existing pruning methods on directly trained SNNs.

Parallel Simulation of Quantum Networks with Distributed Quantum State Management\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hardware optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantum network simulators offer the opportunity to cost-efficiently investigate potential avenues to building networks that scale with the number of users, communication distance, and application demands by simulating alternative hardware designs and control protocols. Several quantum network simulators have been recently developed with these goals in mind. However, as the size of the simulated networks increases, sequential execution becomes time consuming. Parallel execution presents a suitable method for scalable simulations of large-scale quantum networks, but the unique attributes of quantum information create some unexpected challenges. In this work we identify requirements for parallel simulation of quantum networks and develop the first parallel discrete event quantum network simulator by modifying the existing serial SeQUeNCe simulator. Our contributions include the design and development of a quantum state manager (QSM) that maintains shared quantum information distributed across multiple processes. We also optimize our parallel code by minimizing the overhead of the QSM and decreasing the amount of synchronization among processes. Using these techniques, we observe a speedup of 2 to 25 times when simulating a 1,024-node linear network with 2 to 128 processes. We also observe efficiency greater than 0.5 for up to 32 processes in a linear network topology of the same size and with the same workload. We repeat this evaluation with a randomized workload on a caveman network. Finally, we also introduce several methods for partitioning networks by mapping them to different parallel simulation processes. We released the parallel SeQUeNCe simulator as an open-source tool alongside the existing sequential version.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. BOXR: Body and head motion Optimization framework for eXtended Reality\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hardware optimization*\n\n*Cong Liu, Hyoseung Kim, Zexin Li, Ziliang Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of standalone XR systems has enhanced user mobility, accommodating both subtle, frequent head motions and substantial, less frequent body motions. However, the pervasively used M2D latency metric, which measures the delay between the most recent motion and its corresponding display update, only accounts for head motions. This oversight can leave users prone to motion sickness if significant body motion is involved. Although existing methods optimize M2D latency through asynchronous task scheduling and reprojection methods, they introduce challenges like resource contention between tasks and outdated pose data. These challenges are further complicated by user motion dynamics and scene changes during runtime. To address these issues, we for the first time introduce the C2D latency metric, which captures the delay caused by body motions, and present BOXR, a framework designed to co-optimize both body and head motion delays within an XR system. BOXR enhances the coordination between M2D and C2D latencies by efficiently scheduling tasks to avoid contentions while maintaining an up-to-date pose in the output frame. Moreover, BOXR incorporates a motion-driven visual inertial odometer to adjust to user motion dynamics and employs scene-dependent foveated rendering to manage changes in the scene effectively. Our evaluations show that BOXR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in 11 EuRoC MAV datasets across 4 XR applications across 3 hardware platforms. In controlled motion and scene settings, BOXR reduces M2D and C2D latencies by up to 63% and 27%, respectively and increases frame rate by up to 43%. In practical deployments, BOXR achieves substantial reductions in real-world scenarios up to 42% in M2D latency and 31% in C2D latency while maintaining remarkably low miss rates of only 1.6% for M2D requirements and 1.0% for C2D requirements.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. INFaaS: A Model-less and Managed Inference Serving System\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state management hardware optimization*\n\n*Christos Kozyrakis, Qian Li, Neeraja J. Yadwadkar, Francisco Romero*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite existing work in machine learning inference serving, ease-of-use and cost efficiency remain challenges at large scales. Developers must manually search through thousands of model-variants -- versions of already-trained models that differ in hardware, resource footprints, latencies, costs, and accuracies -- to meet the diverse application requirements. Since requirements, query load, and applications themselves evolve over time, these decisions need to be made dynamically for each inference query to avoid excessive costs through naive autoscaling. To avoid navigating through the large and complex trade-off space of model-variants, developers often fix a variant across queries, and replicate it when load increases. However, given the diversity across variants and hardware platforms in the cloud, a lack of understanding of the trade-off space can incur significant costs to developers. This paper introduces INFaaS, a managed and model-less system for distributed inference serving, where developers simply specify the performance and accuracy requirements for their applications without needing to specify a specific model-variant for each query. INFaaS generates model-variants, and efficiently navigates the large trade-off space of model-variants on behalf of developers to meet application-specific objectives: (a) for each query, it selects a model, hardware architecture, and model optimizations, (b) it combines VM-level horizontal autoscaling with model-level autoscaling, where multiple, different model-variants are used to serve queries within each machine. By leveraging diverse variants and sharing hardware resources across models, INFaaS achieves 1.3x higher throughput, violates latency objectives 1.6x less often, and saves up to 21.6x in cost (8.5x on average) compared to state-of-the-art inference serving systems on AWS EC2.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on efficient state management and hardware optimization, here are some key insights and strategies derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Efficient State Management Techniques\n\n### Block-Based Processing and Tiling\n- Techniques like tiling and block-based processing are crucial for optimizing memory access and improving cache utilization. These methods, as seen in \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"CHELA,\" help in handling long sequences efficiently by dividing the computation into intrablock and inter-block components. This approach leverages GPU hardware effectively and reduces memory overhead.\n\n### Hierarchical Structures\n- Hierarchical structures, such as those used in \"CHELA,\" can reduce the memory footprint by combining short-long convolutions with linear attention. This approach maintains real linear complexity while improving hardware utilization.\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms\n- IO-aware algorithms are essential for real performance gains. These algorithms optimize data movement and access patterns, which is critical for efficient state management in language models.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n- Implementing hardware-efficient attention mechanisms such as Gated Linear Attention (GLA) can provide competitive performance with efficient training. GLA introduces data-dependent gates, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n- Optimizations specific to the hardware, such as those leveraging GPU architecture, can significantly improve throughput. For example, using streaming multiprocessors (SMs) and Single-Instruction Multiple-Threads (SIMT) can maximize the utilization of GPU cores.\n\n### Memory Organization and Access\n- Efficient memory organization, as discussed in the context of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), is crucial. Optimizing memory allocation and data flow, such as dividing memory into specific parts for different data types (e.g., spike input, parameters, and membrane potentials), can maximize throughput and efficiency.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Architectures\n\n### Divide-and-Conquer Strategies\n- Divide-and-conquer strategies, as employed in \"Lightning Attention-2\" and \"CHELA,\" reduce the computational complexity and memory overhead associated with long sequences. This approach helps in managing states efficiently by breaking down the computation into manageable blocks.\n\n### Cache Utilization\n- Improving cache utilization through block-based processing is vital for reducing memory access latency and enhancing overall performance. This is particularly important for autoregressive models that process sequences sequentially.\n\n## Integration Opportunities\n\n### Combining Tiling with Test-Time Training\n- Integrating tiling techniques with test-time training can further optimize the model's performance by adapting to the specific input sequences during inference. This dynamic adaptation can lead to better state management and improved efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Software Co-Optimization\n- Adopting hardware-software co-optimization strategies, similar to those used for SNNs, can lead to highly resource-efficient designs. This involves optimizing both the software algorithms and the hardware architecture to achieve fast and accurate inference.\n\nBy incorporating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of state management but also optimized for hardware performance, leading to better scalability, lower latency, and improved overall performance.\n",

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

LasUIE: Unifying Information Extraction with Latent Adaptive Structure-aware Generative Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Hao Fei, Shengqiong Wu, Jingye Li, Bobo Li, Fei Li, Libo Qin, Meishan Zhang, M. Zhang, Tat-seng Chua*\n\n**TL;DR:** In this work, a novel structure-aware GLM is proposed, fully unleashing the power of syntactic knowledge for UIE, and rich task-adaptive structural bias is learned that greatly resolves the UIE crux, the long-range dependence issue and boundary identifying.\n\n**Abstract:** Universally modeling all typical information extraction tasks (UIE) with one generative language model (GLM) has revealed great potential by the latest study, where various IE predictions are unified into a linearized hierarchical expression under a GLM. Syntactic structure information, a type of effective feature which has been extensively utilized in IE community, should also be beneficial to UIE. In this work, we propose a novel structure-aware GLM, fully unleashing the power of syntactic knowledge for UIE. A heterogeneous structure inductor is explored to unsupervisedly induce rich heterogeneous structural representations by post-training an existing GLM. In particular, a structural broadcaster is devised to compact various latent trees into explicit high-order forests, helping to guide a better generation during decoding. We finally introduce a task-oriented structure fine-tuning mechanism, further adjusting the learned structures to most coincide with the end-task's need. Over 12 IE benchmarks across 7 tasks our system shows significant improvements over the baseline UIE system. Further in-depth analyses show that our GLM learns rich task-adaptive structural bias that greatly resolves the UIE crux, the long-range dependence issue and boundary identifying.

From Characters to Words: Hierarchical Pre-trained Language Model for Open-vocabulary Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Li Sun, F. Luisier, K. Batmanghelich, D. Flor\u00eancio, Changrong Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level, and demonstrates that this hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.\n\n**Abstract:** Current state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding require a preprocessing step to convert raw text into discrete tokens. This process known as tokenization relies on a pre-built vocabulary of words or sub-word morphemes. This fixed vocabulary limits the model\u2019s robustness to spelling errors and its capacity to adapt to new domains. In this work, we introduce a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level. Concretely, we design an intra-word module that uses a shallow Transformer architecture to learn word representations from their characters, and a deep inter-word Transformer module that contextualizes each word representation by attending to the entire word sequence. Our model thus directly operates on character sequences with explicit awareness of word boundaries, but without biased sub-word or word-level vocabulary. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines. We also demonstrate that our hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Span Fine-tuning for Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Rongzhou Bao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel span fine-tuning method for PrLMs is presented, which facilitates the span setting to be adaptively determined by specific downstream tasks during the fine- Tuning phase.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (PrLM) have to carefully manage input units when training on a very large text with a vocabulary consisting of millions of words. Previous works have shown that incorporating span-level information over consecutive words in pre-training could further improve the performance of PrLMs. However, given that span-level clues are introduced and fixed in pre-training, previous methods are time-consuming and lack of flexibility. To alleviate the inconvenience, this paper presents a novel span fine-tuning method for PrLMs, which facilitates the span setting to be adaptively determined by specific downstream tasks during the fine-tuning phase. In detail, any sentences processed by the PrLM will be segmented into multiple spans according to a pre-sampled dictionary. Then the segmentation information will be sent through a hierarchical CNN module together with the representation outputs of the PrLM and ultimately generate a span-enhanced representation. Experiments on GLUE benchmark show that the proposed span fine-tuning method significantly enhances the PrLM, and at the same time, offer more flexibility in an efficient way.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Yifan Jiang, Shiyu Chang, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures, and develops a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful\"universal\"models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics.

MVSFormer++: Revealing the Devil in Transformer's Details for Multi-View Stereo\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Chenjie Cao, Xinlin Ren, Yanwei Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline, and achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in learning-based Multi-View Stereo (MVS) methods have prominently featured transformer-based models with attention mechanisms. However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. CrossGNN: Confronting Noisy Multivariate Time Series Via Cross Interaction Refinement\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Qihe Huang, Lei Shen, Ruixin Zhang, Shouhong Ding, Binwu Wang, Zhengyang Zhou, Yang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** CrossGNN is proposed, a linear complexity GNN model to refine the cross-scale and cross-variable interaction for MTS, and extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, multivariate time series (MTS) forecasting techniques have seen rapid development and widespread applications across various fields. Transformer-based and GNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model interaction of time and variables. However, by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the real-world data, we observe that the temporal fluctuations and heterogeneity between variables are not well handled by existing methods. To address the above issues, we propose CrossGNN, a linear complexity GNN model to refine the cross-scale and cross-variable interaction for MTS. To deal with the unexpected noise in time dimension, an adaptive multi-scale identifier (AMSI) is leveraged to construct multi-scale time series with reduced noise. A Cross-Scale GNN is proposed to extract the scales with clearer trend and weaker noise. Cross-Variable GNN is proposed to utilize the homogeneity and heterogeneity between different variables. By simultaneously focusing on edges with higher saliency scores and constraining those edges with lower scores, the time and space complexity (i.e., O ( L ) ) of CrossGNN can be linear with the input sequence length L . Extensive experimental results on 8 real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.

MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient hierarchical normalization for NLP*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any attribute combination. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 24 VRP variants show RouteFinder achieves competitive results.

SAFIN: Arbitrary Style Transfer With Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Xinyu Gong, Shreeshail Hingane, Aaditya Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style characteristics of one image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.\n\n**Conference:** safin-arbitrary-style-transfer-with-self-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher advance the **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm** proposal and design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key insights and recommendations based on the provided analysis and external sources:\n\n### Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Normalization\n\n- The proposal to integrate hierarchical and multi-scale normalization within RMSNorm is novel and aligns with current research trends.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models. Our code, hyperparameters and CUDA kernels for sparse attention are available in PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/20 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Sungjin Ahn, and Yoshua Bengio. 2017.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 50/97 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2404.05892, 2024.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical RMSNorm*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9566  (*Influential: 1895*)\n\n#### 2.

Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Multi-Scale Adaptive Network for Single Image Denoising\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization*\n\n*Yuanbiao Gou, Peng Hu, Jiancheng Lv, Xiaocui Peng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper reveals the missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and proposes a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising, which simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-scale architectures have shown effectiveness in a variety of tasks thanks to appealing cross-scale complementarity. However, existing architectures treat different scale features equally without considering the scale-specific characteristics, \\textit{i.e.}, the within-scale characteristics are ignored in the architecture design. In this paper, we reveal this missing piece for multi-scale architecture design and accordingly propose a novel Multi-Scale Adaptive Network (MSANet) for single image denoising. Specifically, MSANet simultaneously embraces the within-scale characteristics and the cross-scale complementarity thanks to three novel neural blocks, \\textit{i.e.}, adaptive feature block (AFeB), adaptive multi-scale block (AMB), and adaptive fusion block (AFuB). In brief, AFeB is designed to adaptively preserve image details and filter noises, which is highly expected for the features with mixed details and noises. AMB could enlarge the receptive field and aggregate the multi-scale information, which meets the need of contextually informative features. AFuB devotes to adaptively sampling and transferring the features from one scale to another scale, which fuses the multi-scale features with varying characteristics from coarse to fine. Extensive experiments on both three real and six synthetic noisy image datasets show the superiority of MSANet compared with 12 methods.

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios.

Learning Controllable Adaptive Simulation for Multi-resolution Physics\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization*\n\n*Tailin Wu, T. Maruyama, Qingqing Zhao, Gordon Wetzstein, J. Leskovec*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions.\n\n**Abstract:** Simulating the time evolution of physical systems is pivotal in many scientific and engineering problems. An open challenge in simulating such systems is their multi-resolution dynamics: a small fraction of the system is extremely dynamic, and requires very fine-grained resolution, while a majority of the system is changing slowly and can be modeled by coarser spatial scales. Typical learning-based surrogate models use a uniform spatial scale, which needs to resolve to the finest required scale and can waste a huge compute to achieve required accuracy. In this work, we introduce Learning controllable Adaptive simulation for Multi-resolution Physics (LAMP) as the first full deep learning-based surrogate model that jointly learns the evolution model and optimizes appropriate spatial resolutions that devote more compute to the highly dynamic regions. LAMP consists of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) for learning the forward evolution, and a GNN-based actor-critic for learning the policy of spatial refinement and coarsening. We introduce learning techniques that optimizes LAMP with weighted sum of error and computational cost as objective, allowing LAMP to adapt to varying relative importance of error vs. computation tradeoff at inference time. We evaluate our method in a 1D benchmark of nonlinear PDEs and a challenging 2D mesh-based simulation. We demonstrate that our LAMP outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning surrogate models, and can adaptively trade-off computation to improve long-term prediction error: it achieves an average of 33.7% error reduction for 1D nonlinear PDEs, and outperforms MeshGraphNets + classical Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) in 2D mesh-based simulations.

MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient normalization*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient normalization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 9. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient normalization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SNIPER: Efficient Multi-Scale Training\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization*\n\n*Mahyar Najibi, Larry S. Davis, Bharat Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SNIPER, an algorithm for performing efficient multi-scale training\nin instance level visual recognition tasks. Instead of processing every pixel\nin an image pyramid, SNIPER processes context regions around ground-truth\ninstances (referred to as chips) at the appropriate scale. For background\nsampling, these context-regions are generated using proposals extracted from a\nregion proposal network trained with a short learning schedule. Hence, the\nnumber of chips generated per image during training adaptively changes based on\nthe scene complexity. SNIPER only processes 30% more pixels compared to the\ncommonly used single scale training at 800x1333 pixels on the COCO dataset.\nBut, it also observes samples from extreme resolutions of the image pyramid,\nlike 1400x2000 pixels. As SNIPER operates on resampled low resolution chips\n(512x512 pixels), it can have a batch size as large as 20 on a single GPU even\nwith a ResNet-101 backbone. Therefore it can benefit from batch-normalization\nduring training without the need for synchronizing batch-normalization\nstatistics across GPUs. SNIPER brings training of instance level recognition\ntasks like object detection closer to the protocol for image classification and\nsuggests that the commonly accepted guideline that it is important to train on\nhigh resolution images for instance level visual recognition tasks might not be\ncorrect. Our implementation based on Faster-RCNN with a ResNet-101 backbone\nobtains an mAP of 47.6% on the COCO dataset for bounding box detection and can\nprocess 5 images per second during inference with a single GPU.

In contrast to the\nmajority of prior techniques that concentrate on global or mid-level\nattributes, e.g., for shape classification or semantic labeling, we suggest a\npatch-based learning method, in which a series of local patches at multiple\nscales around each point is encoded in a structured manner.

Our main contributions\ninclude both a novel multi-scale variant of the recently proposed PointNet\narchitecture with emphasis on local shape information, and a series of novel\napplications in which we demonstrate how learning from training data arising\nfrom well-structured triangle meshes, and applying the trained model to noisy\npoint clouds can produce superior results compared to specialized\nstate-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our\napproach in the context of shape reconstruction, by showing how it can be used\nto extract normal orientation information from point clouds.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient normalization*\n\n*Mark D. McDonnell*\n\n**Abstract:** For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should\nideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually\nincrease when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements\nin error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks\ndeployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We\nalso considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test\nresults of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error\nrates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our\nerror-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that\noverfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning\nbatch normalization scale and offset parameters.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient normalization*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models. The code is accessible at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher evaluate and develop the **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm** proposal, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Novelty and Uniqueness\n\n- The concept of hierarchical and adaptive normalization is not entirely new, but its specific application to RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Layer Normalization) could be innovative. Existing works have explored various normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization, RMSNorm, and DeepNorm, which are used in large language models (LLMs) to improve training stability and performance.\n\n### Technical Feasibility\n\n- **Multi-scale Normalization:** The idea of multi-scale normalization can be seen in frameworks like the Multiscale Label Area Hybrid Network (MLAH), which uses hierarchical multiscale attention modules to mitigate issues related to sparse label distribution and enhance feature representation. This suggests that integrating multi-scale normalization into RMSNorm could be technically feasible.\n- **Adaptive Computation:** Adaptive computation is a common theme in modern neural network architectures. For example, the use of dynamic parameter adjustments and adaptive learning rates is well-documented in the context of LLMs. This adaptivity can be integrated into normalization layers to optimize resource allocation and improve efficiency.\n\n### Impact on Model Performance\n\n- **Normalization Techniques:** Studies have shown that different normalization techniques can significantly impact model performance. For instance, pre-layer normalization and RMSNorm have been shown to provide training stability and faster convergence in LLMs.\n- **Hierarchical Processing:** Hierarchical structures, such as those used in the Graph Attention Feature Fusion Module (GAFM) and MLAH, have demonstrated improved performance by capturing dependencies at multiple scales. This suggests that hierarchical processing within normalization layers could enhance model accuracy and robustness.\n\n### Alignment with Current Research Trends\n\n- **Normalization in LLMs:** Current research trends in LLMs emphasize the importance of efficient and effective normalization techniques. The use of pre-layer normalization, RMSNorm, and other variants is widespread, indicating that innovations in this area are highly relevant and aligned with contemporary research.\n- **Adaptive and Multi-scale Methods:** There is a growing interest in adaptive and multi-scale methods across various neural network applications. This aligns well with the proposal to introduce hierarchical and adaptive mechanisms into RMSNorm.\n\n### Potential Challenges and Limitations\n\n- **Complexity and Trade-offs:** Introducing hierarchical and adaptive mechanisms can add complexity to the model architecture and training procedures. This might lead to trade-offs between efficiency and expressiveness, and careful evaluation is needed to ensure that these modifications do not compromise model stability or generalization capabilities.\n- **Hardware Efficiency:** Optimizing for hardware efficiency is crucial, especially for large-scale models. Techniques like dynamic offloading of parameters to the CPU, as seen in the INFMOE framework, can be beneficial but require careful implementation to avoid performance degradation.\n\n### Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Normalization:** The MLAH framework provides a good example of how hierarchical multiscale attention can enhance feature representation. Applying a similar concept to normalization could allow the model to better capture context at multiple scales.\n- **Adaptive Computation:** The dynamic adjustment of normalization parameters can be inspired by adaptive learning rate schedules and other adaptive techniques used in LLM training. This can help in optimizing computational resources and improving overall efficiency.\n- **Empirical Evidence:** To validate the proposal, it is essential to gather empirical evidence from studies that have implemented similar normalization enhancements. For example, comparing the performance of models using hierarchical and adaptive normalization against those using standard RMSNorm or other normalization techniques would provide valuable insights.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **External Searches:** Use keywords like \"hierarchical RMSNorm,\" \"multi-scale adaptive normalization,\" and \"hardware-efficient normalization\" to search for recent studies and implementations related to these techniques in neural networks, particularly in the context of language models.\n- **Internal Library Searches:** Perform a vector similarity search within the internal repository to find closely related works or internal reports that align with the proposal's features.\n- **Comparative Analysis:** Gather information on existing normalization methods to benchmark the proposed enhancements against state-of-the-art techniques.\n- **Feasibility Assessment:** Investigate implementation strategies and potential challenges in integrating hierarchical and adaptive mechanisms within RMSNorm, ensuring compatibility with existing model architectures and hardware constraints.\n\n### References\n\n- **Text-Enhanced Graph Attention Hashing for Cross-Modal Retrieval:** This paper provides insights into hierarchical and multi-scale feature fusion techniques that could be adapted for normalization layers.\n- **A Comprehensive Overview of Large Language Models:** This overview discusses various normalization techniques used in LLMs, including pre-layer normalization and RMSNorm, and highlights the importance of efficient normalization in large-scale models.\n- **Awesome Language Model Analysis:** This repository lists papers that analyze the theoretical and empirical aspects of language models, including their learning behavior and generalization abilities, which can provide context for evaluating the proposed normalization techniques.\n",

We evaluate our model, the N-Grammer on language modeling on the C4 data-set as well as text classification on the SuperGLUE data-set, and find that it outperforms several strong baselines such as the Transformer and the Primer.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

However, the high computational cost makes it quite challenging to deploy on resource-constraint devices. This paper investigates the computational bottleneck modules of efficient transformer, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. LayerNorm is commonly used in transformer architectures but is not computational friendly due to statistic calculation during inference.

For example, our SLAB-Swin obtains $83.6 \\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of Flatten-Swin with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower latency.

Introduction\n\nIntroduced initially for tasks in natural language processing (Vaswani et al., 2017), transformer architecture has\n\n[^0]rapidly emerged as a preeminent model in the landscape of language models. Its influence has significantly expanded with the introduction of Vision Transformer (ViT) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2020), illustrating the efficacy and versatility of transformer-based architectures. These architectures have demonstrated their capability to achieve competitive performance benchmarks in comparison to convolutional neural networks (CNNs) across diverse vision tasks (Han et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023a; Carion et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2023). Due to its powerful performance, transformer has become the mainstream architecture in deep learning. However, the computational demands of transformer architecture pose a significant challenge, which is predominantly due to the quadratic computational complexity of its attention mechanism and the necessity for online statistic computation of LayerNorm component. Numerous efforts have been directed towards enhancing the efficiency of transformer architecture (Tang et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2023; Tang et al., 2023b). Several approaches have sought to mitigate computational complexity by limiting the scope of token interactions within self-attention mechanisms, such as downsampling the key and value matrices (Wang et al., 2021), implementing sparse global attention patterns (Child et al., 2019), and computing selfattention within smaller windows (Tu et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2021; Dong et al., 2022). Meanwhile, linear attention emerges as an alternative strategy to enhance computational efficiency by breaking down the attention mechanism into linear computational cost (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Cai et al., 2022; Han et al., 2023; You et al., 2023), yet it is still a challenging task to obtain a good balance between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, there are some explorations into substituting LayerNorm (LN) with BatchNorm (BN) within transformers, motivated by the additional computational overhead LayerNorm incurs during inference. Yang et al. (2022) propose to add a BatchNorm layer in-between the two linear layers in the feed forward network to stabilize the training. However, there still exists a performance gap between the LayerNorm-based and BatchNorm-based transformers. In this paper, we focus on obtaining efficient transformer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_d98ef7f3d09ffeb83a3fg-02.jpg?height=508&width=770&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 1. Comparisons of different methods on ImageNet. architectures by digging deep into the computational inefficient modules, i.e., normalization layers and attention modules. We first explore to replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm to accelerate inference for transformer. BatchNorm leads to lower inference latency but may cause training collapse and inferior performance, while LayerNorm could stabilize the training yet has extra computational cost during inference. To this end, we first propose a progressive strategy to gradually replace LayerNorm with BatchNorm by using a hyper-parameter to control the proportion of both normalization layers. Initially the transformer architecture is dominated by the LayerNorm and gradually transits to pure BatchNorm at the end of training. This strategy effectively mitigates the risk of training collapse and also eliminating the need for calculating statistics during inference. In addition to the progressive strategy, we also propose a novel re-parameterization formula for BatchNorm (RepBN), to enhance training stability and overall performance. Furthermore, the computational cost of attention is critical for efficient transformer and prior methods struggle to obtain good balance of efficiency and accuracy. To this end, we propose a simplified linear attention (SLA) module which utilizes ReLU as the kernel function and incorporate a depthwise convolution to perform local feature enhancement. The proposed attention mechanism is more efficient than prior linear attention but still attains comparable performance. We extensively evaluate our proposed method for various architectures on various benchmarks. Our progressive reparameterized BatchNorm shows strong performance for image classification and object detection tasks, obtaining similar accuracy with lower inference latency. Moreover, coupled with the progressive RepBN and simplified linear attention module, our SLAB transformer achieves competitive accuracy compared to Flatten transformer with improved computational efficiency. For example, SLAB-SwinS achieves $83.6 \\%$ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K with 16.2 ms latency, which is 2.4 ms less than that of FlattenSwin-S with $0.1 \\%$ higher accuracy. We also evaluated our method for language modeling task and obtain comparable performance and lower inference latency.\n```\n\n#### 4. Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.81)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Score: 0.80)\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 32  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work describes an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture that exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the Transformer architecture. The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/34 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nWe defer the detailed analysis to appendix Section A. 5 and A.6. ## 8 Experiments And Results\n\nWe have implemented the proposed hierarchical attention using Jax, an open source library ${ }^{5}$ for automatic gradient computation and linear algebra operations on GPUs and TPUs. All numerical operations in our algorithm use the Numpy native linear algebra functions supported by Jax. In all our experiments in this section, we use the standard Transformer architecture described in (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the backbone for our HTransformer-1D model. Unless specified otherwise, the model parameters are: number of layers is 6 , number of heads is 8 , word embedding size is 512 and the feed-forward module (FFN) size is 2048 . We follow the API for the standard multihead scaled dot-product attention implementation ${ }^{6}$ so that we can perform a simple drop-in replacement of the standard multihead attention with our hierarchical attention implementation. This allows for an easy and fair comparison. ### 8.1 Long-Range Arena\n\nThe open-source Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark ${ }^{7}$ has been proposed as a standard way to probe and quantify the capabilities of various xformer (long-range Transformer) architectures (Tay et al., 2020c). In our case, it also serves to highlight the effectiveness of the inductive bias inspired by the H-Matrix method, as well as the capability of our hierarchical attention to handle long sequences. The LRA has several desirable qualities that made us focus on it as a primary evaluation benchmark: generality (restricted to encoder-only tasks\n\n[^3]to accommodate most proposals); simplicity (no pretraining, no data augmentation allowed); difficulty (large headroom with existing approaches); long-input focus (so that modeling improvements in this area are visible); diverse (6 tasks, covering math, language, image, and spatial modeling); and lightweight (so that modeling improvements are measurable independently of the ability to train and run high-capacity models). The tasks that comprise LRA are: ListOps (sequences of arithmetical expressions of lengths of up to 2 K that tests the ability to reason hierarchically while handling long context); Text (byte/character-level text classification at document level, which both simulates longer input sequences - max length 4 K - and increases the difficulty level); Retrieval (byte/character-level document retrieval, which simulates the ability to model document similarity as a score between two independently-encoded long input sequences - max length $4 \\mathrm{~K}+4 \\mathrm{~K}=8 \\mathrm{~K}$ ); Image (image classification based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, where an NxN image is flattened to a sequence of length $\\mathrm{N}^{2}$ pixels); Pathfinder (long-range spatial dependency task, with images consisting of two small circles and dash-line paths that either connect the two circles or not - image dimensions of $32 \\times 32$ for a pixel sequence of length 1,024); Path-X (same as Pathfinder, but for image dimensions of $128 \\times 128$ for a total pixel sequence of length 16,384). The default Transformer model parameters such as number of layers and number of heads etc are pre-determined by the benchmark configuration for each task. The results obtained by our H-Transformer-1D model on the LRA benchmark are given in Table 1. Overall, the H-Transformer-1D model achieves 61.41 average accuracy, a +6.4 points improvement over the previous-best average performance from BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020). We want to highlight ListOps, Text and Retrieval because they all involve long sequences and H-Transformer-1D model improves SOTA performance by relatively large margins. These should be strong evidences to support our hypothesis in section 5.1 and validate the inductive bias due to the hierarchical attention. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Path-X | Avg |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Chance | 10.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 10.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 44.00 |\n| Transformer | 36.37 | 64.27 | 57.46 | 42.44 | 71.40 | FAIL | 54.39 |\n| Local Attention | 15.82 | 52.98 | 53.39 | 41.46 | 66.63 | FAIL | 46.06 |\n| Sparse Trans. | 17.07 | 63.58 | $\\underline{59.59}$ | $\\underline{44.24}$ | 71.71 | FAIL | 51.24 |\n| Longformer | 35.63 | 62.85 | 56.89 | 42.22 | 69.71 | FAIL | 53.46 |\n| Linformer | 35.70 | 53.94 | 52.27 | 38.56 | $\\mathbf{7 6 . 3 4}$ | FAIL | 51.36 |\n| Reformer | $\\underline{37.27}$ | 56.10 | 53.40 | 38.07 | 68.50 | FAIL | 50.67 |\n| Sinkhorn Trans. | 33.67 | 61.20 | 53.83 | 41.23 | 67.45 | FAIL | 51.39 |\n| Synthesizer | 36.99 | 61.68 | 54.67 | 41.61 | 69.45 | FAIL | 52.88 |\n| BigBird | 36.05 | 64.02 | 59.29 | 40.83 | 74.87 | FAIL | $\\underline{55.01}$ |\n| Linear Trans. | 16.13 | $\\underline{65.90}$ | 53.09 | 42.34 | 75.30 | FAIL | 50.55 |\n| Performer | 18.01 | 65.40 | 53.82 | 42.77 | $\\mathbf{7 7 . 0 5}$ | FAIL | 51.41 |\n| H-Transformer-1D | $\\mathbf{4 9 .\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical multi-scale normalization, adaptive hierarchical RMSNorm, hierarchical adaptive layer normalization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Normalization for Robust Monocular Depth Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Chi Zhang, Wei Yin, Zhibin Wang, Gang Yu, Bin Fu, Chunhua Shen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions and presents two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we address monocular depth estimation with deep neural networks. To enable training of deep monocular estimation models with various sources of datasets, state-of-the-art methods adopt image-level normalization strategies to generate affine-invariant depth representations. However, learning with image-level normalization mainly emphasizes the relations of pixel representations with the global statistic in the images, such as the structure of the scene, while the fine-grained depth difference may be overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale depth normalization method that hierarchically normalizes the depth representations based on spatial information and depth distributions. Compared with previous normalization strategies applied only at the holistic image level, the proposed hierarchical normalization can effectively preserve the fine-grained details and improve accuracy. We present two strategies that define the hierarchical normalization contexts in the depth domain and the spatial domain, respectively. Our extensive experiments show that the proposed normalization strategy remarkably outperforms previous normalization methods, and we set new state-of-the-art on five zero-shot transfer benchmark datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Single document summarization (SDS) systems have benefited from advances in neural encoder-decoder model thanks to the availability of large datasets. However, multi-document summarization (MDS) of news articles has been limited to datasets of a couple of hundred examples. In this paper, we introduce Multi-News, the first large-scale MDS news dataset. Additionally, we propose an end-to-end model which incorporates a traditional extractive summarization model with a standard SDS model and achieves competitive results on MDS datasets. We benchmark several methods on Multi-News and hope that this work will promote advances in summarization in the multi-document setting.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 502  (*Influential: 127*)\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Graph Transformer with Adaptive Node Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical RMSNorm*\n\n*Zaixin Zhang, Qi Liu, Qingyong Hu, Cheekong Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the main deficiencies of current graph transformers and formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has achieved remarkable success in a number of domains including natural language processing and computer vision. However, when it comes to graph-structured data, transformers have not achieved competitive performance, especially on large graphs. In this paper, we identify the main deficiencies of current graph transformers:(1) Existing node sampling strategies in Graph Transformers are agnostic to the graph characteristics and the training process. (2) Most sampling strategies only focus on local neighbors and neglect the long-range dependencies in the graph. We conduct experimental investigations on synthetic datasets to show that existing sampling strategies are sub-optimal. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we formulate the optimization strategies of node sampling in Graph Transformer as an adversary bandit problem, where the rewards are related to the attention weights and can vary in the training procedure. Meanwhile, we propose a hierarchical attention scheme with graph coarsening to capture the long-range interactions while reducing computational complexity. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets to demonstrate the superiority of our method over existing graph transformers and popular GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 63  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 5. Adaptive Hierarchical Certification for Segmentation using Randomized Smoothing\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical RMSNorm*\n\n*Alaa Anani, Tobias Lorenz, B. Schiele, Mario Fritz*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel, more practical setting, which certifies pixels within a multi-level hierarchy, and adaptively relaxes the certification to a coarser level for unstable components classic methods would abstain from, effectively lowering the abstain rate whilst providing more certified semantically meaningful information.\n\n**Abstract:** Certification for machine learning is proving that no adversarial sample can evade a model within a range under certain conditions, a necessity for safety-critical domains. Common certification methods for segmentation use a flat set of fine-grained classes, leading to high abstain rates due to model uncertainty across many classes. We propose a novel, more practical setting, which certifies pixels within a multi-level hierarchy, and adaptively relaxes the certification to a coarser level for unstable components classic methods would abstain from, effectively lowering the abstain rate whilst providing more certified semantically meaningful information. We mathematically formulate the problem setup, introduce an adaptive hierarchical certification algorithm and prove the correctness of its guarantees. Since certified accuracy does not take the loss of information into account for coarser classes, we introduce the Certified Information Gain ($\\mathrm{CIG}$) metric, which is proportional to the class granularity level. Our extensive experiments on the datasets Cityscapes, PASCAL-Context, ACDC and COCO-Stuff demonstrate that our adaptive algorithm achieves a higher $\\mathrm{CIG}$ and lower abstain rate compared to the current state-of-the-art certification method.

Hierarchical Adaptive Value Estimation for Multi-modal Visual Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive hierarchical RMSNorm*\n\n*Yangru Huang, Peixi Peng, Yifan Zhao, Haoran Xu, Mengyue Geng, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Local modality-customized Value Estimation (LVE) paradigm is proposed, which dynamically estimates the contribution and adjusts the importance weight of each modality from a value-level perspective, and a task-contextual re-fusion process is developed to achieve a task-level re-balance of estimations from both feature and value levels.\n\n**Abstract:** Integrating RGB frames with alternative modality inputs is gaining increasing traction in many vision-based reinforcement learning (RL) applications. Existing multi-modal vision-based RL methods usually follow a Global Value Estimation (GVE) pipeline, which uses a fused modality feature to obtain a uni\ufb01ed global environmental description. However, such a feature-level fusion paradigm with a single critic may fall short in policy learning as it tends to overlook the distinct values of each modality. To remedy this, this paper proposes a Local modality-customized Value Estimation (LVE) paradigm, which dynamically estimates the contribution and adjusts the importance weight of each modality from a value-level perspective. Furthermore, a task-contextual re-fusion process is developed to achieve a task-level re-balance of estimations from both feature and value levels. To this end, a Hierarchical Adaptive Value Estimation (HAVE) framework is formed, which adaptively coordinates the contributions of individual modalities as well as their collective ef\ufb01cacy. Agents trained by HAVE are able to exploit the unique characteristics of various modalities while capturing their intricate interactions, achieving substantially improved performance. We speci\ufb01cally highlight the potency of our approach within the challenging landscape of autonomous driving, utilizing the CARLA benchmark with neuromorphic event and depth data to demonstrate HAVE\u2019s capability and the effectiveness of its distinct components.

The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets.

Out-of-Distribution Detection with An Adaptive Likelihood Ratio on Informative Hierarchical VAE\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Yewen Li, Chaojie Wang, Xiaobo Xia, Tongliang Liu, Xin Miao, Bo An*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel score function for unsupervised OOD detection, referred to as Adaptive Likelihood Ratio, which can selectively aggregate the semantic information on multiple hidden layers of hierarchical VAEs, leading to a strong separability between in-distribution and OOD samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the reliability of machine learning. In the literature, existing work has shown that higher-level semantics captured by hierarchical VAEs can be used to detect OOD instances. However, we empirically show that, the inheirt \u201c posterior collapse \u201d of hierarchical VAEs would seriously limit their capacity for OOD detection. Based on a thorough analysis, we propose an informative hierarchical VAE to alleviate this issue through enhancing the connections between the data sample and its multi-layer stochastic latent representations during training. Furthermore, we propose a novel score function for unsupervised OOD detection, referred to as Adaptive Likelihood Ratio, which can selectively aggregate the semantic information on multiple hidden layers of hierarchical VAEs, leading to a strong separability between in-distribution and OOD samples. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art unsupervised OOD detection approaches.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 261  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Deep Surface Normal Estimation with Hierarchical RGB-D Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Jing Chen, Yanfeng Tong, Jin Zeng, Yunmu Huang, Yongtian Wang, Wenxiu Sun, Qiong Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** The growing availability of commodity RGB-D cameras has boosted the applications in the field of scene understanding. However, as a fundamental scene understanding task, surface normal estimation from RGB-D data lacks thorough investigation. In this paper, a hierarchical fusion network with adaptive feature re-weighting is proposed for surface normal estimation from a single RGB-D image. Specifically, the features from color image and depth are successively integrated at multiple scales to ensure global surface smoothness while preserving visually salient details. Meanwhile, the depth features are re-weighted with a confidence map estimated from depth before merging into the color branch to avoid artifacts caused by input depth corruption. Additionally, a hybrid multi-scale loss function is designed to learn accurate normal estimation given noisy ground-truth dataset. Extensive experimental results validate the effectiveness of the fusion strategy and the loss design, outperforming state-of-the-art normal estimation schemes.\n\n**Conference:** deep-surface-normal-estimation-with-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Taxonomy-Aware and Attentional Graph Capsule RCNNs for Large-Scale Multi-Label Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical multi-scale normalization*\n\n*Jian-Xin Li, Philip S. Yu, Bo Li, Senzhang Wang, Qiran Gong, Lihong Wang, Lifang He, Hao Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** CNNs, RNNs, GCNs, and CapsNets have shown significant insights in representation learning and are widely used in various text mining tasks such as large-scale multi-label text classification. However, most existing deep models for multi-label text classification consider either the non-consecutive and long-distance semantics or the sequential semantics, but how to consider them both coherently is less studied. In addition, most existing methods treat output labels as independent methods, but ignore the hierarchical relations among them, leading to useful semantic information loss. In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical taxonomy-aware and attentional graph capsule recurrent CNNs framework for large-scale multi-label text classification. Specifically, we first propose to model each document as a word order preserved graph-of-words and normalize it as a corresponding words-matrix representation which preserves both the non-consecutive, long-distance and local sequential semantics. Then the words-matrix is input to the proposed attentional graph capsule recurrent CNNs for more effectively learning the semantic features. To leverage the hierarchical relations among the class labels, we propose a hierarchical taxonomy embedding method to learn their representations, and define a novel weighted margin loss by incorporating the label representation similarity. Extensive evaluations on three datasets show that our model significantly improves the performance of large-scale multi-label text classification by comparing with state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-09\n\n\n\n#### 3. LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. 3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Bennett A. Landman, Yuankai Huo, Shunxing Bao, Ho Hin Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/50 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton. 2016.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.63)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/74 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn: Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS) 29 (2016).

Yet, the geometrical implications of softmax-attention remain largely unexplored. In this work we highlight the limitations of constraining attention weights to the probability simplex and the resulting convex hull of value vectors. We show that Transformers are sequence length dependent biased towards token isolation at initialization and contrast Transformers to simple max- and sum-pooling - two strong baselines rarely reported. We propose to replace the softmax in self-attention with normalization, yielding a hyperparameter and data-bias robust, generally applicable architecture. We support our insights with empirical results from more than 25,000 trained models.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

LasUIE: Unifying Information Extraction with Latent Adaptive Structure-aware Generative Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Hao Fei, Shengqiong Wu, Jingye Li, Bobo Li, Fei Li, Libo Qin, Meishan Zhang, M. Zhang, Tat-seng Chua*\n\n**TL;DR:** In this work, a novel structure-aware GLM is proposed, fully unleashing the power of syntactic knowledge for UIE, and rich task-adaptive structural bias is learned that greatly resolves the UIE crux, the long-range dependence issue and boundary identifying.\n\n**Abstract:** Universally modeling all typical information extraction tasks (UIE) with one generative language model (GLM) has revealed great potential by the latest study, where various IE predictions are unified into a linearized hierarchical expression under a GLM. Syntactic structure information, a type of effective feature which has been extensively utilized in IE community, should also be beneficial to UIE. In this work, we propose a novel structure-aware GLM, fully unleashing the power of syntactic knowledge for UIE. A heterogeneous structure inductor is explored to unsupervisedly induce rich heterogeneous structural representations by post-training an existing GLM. In particular, a structural broadcaster is devised to compact various latent trees into explicit high-order forests, helping to guide a better generation during decoding. We finally introduce a task-oriented structure fine-tuning mechanism, further adjusting the learned structures to most coincide with the end-task's need. Over 12 IE benchmarks across 7 tasks our system shows significant improvements over the baseline UIE system. Further in-depth analyses show that our GLM learns rich task-adaptive structural bias that greatly resolves the UIE crux, the long-range dependence issue and boundary identifying.

From Characters to Words: Hierarchical Pre-trained Language Model for Open-vocabulary Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Li Sun, F. Luisier, K. Batmanghelich, D. Flor\u00eancio, Changrong Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level, and demonstrates that this hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.\n\n**Abstract:** Current state-of-the-art models for natural language understanding require a preprocessing step to convert raw text into discrete tokens. This process known as tokenization relies on a pre-built vocabulary of words or sub-word morphemes. This fixed vocabulary limits the model\u2019s robustness to spelling errors and its capacity to adapt to new domains. In this work, we introduce a novel open-vocabulary language model that adopts a hierarchical two-level approach: one at the word level and another at the sequence level. Concretely, we design an intra-word module that uses a shallow Transformer architecture to learn word representations from their characters, and a deep inter-word Transformer module that contextualizes each word representation by attending to the entire word sequence. Our model thus directly operates on character sequences with explicit awareness of word boundaries, but without biased sub-word or word-level vocabulary. Experiments on various downstream tasks show that our method outperforms strong baselines. We also demonstrate that our hierarchical model is robust to textual corruption and domain shift.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Span Fine-tuning for Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical adaptive RMSNorm in language models*\n\n*Rongzhou Bao, Zhuosheng Zhang, Hai Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel span fine-tuning method for PrLMs is presented, which facilitates the span setting to be adaptively determined by specific downstream tasks during the fine- Tuning phase.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models (PrLM) have to carefully manage input units when training on a very large text with a vocabulary consisting of millions of words. Previous works have shown that incorporating span-level information over consecutive words in pre-training could further improve the performance of PrLMs. However, given that span-level clues are introduced and fixed in pre-training, previous methods are time-consuming and lack of flexibility. To alleviate the inconvenience, this paper presents a novel span fine-tuning method for PrLMs, which facilitates the span setting to be adaptively determined by specific downstream tasks during the fine-tuning phase. In detail, any sentences processed by the PrLM will be segmented into multiple spans according to a pre-sampled dictionary. Then the segmentation information will be sent through a hierarchical CNN module together with the representation outputs of the PrLM and ultimately generate a span-enhanced representation. Experiments on GLUE benchmark show that the proposed span fine-tuning method significantly enhances the PrLM, and at the same time, offer more flexibility in an efficient way.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. TransGAN: Two Pure Transformers Can Make One Strong GAN, and That Can Scale Up\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Yifan Jiang, Shiyu Chang, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures, and develops a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent explosive interest on transformers has suggested their potential to become powerful\"universal\"models for computer vision tasks, such as classification, detection, and segmentation. While those attempts mainly study the discriminative models, we explore transformers on some more notoriously difficult vision tasks, e.g., generative adversarial networks (GANs). Our goal is to conduct the first pilot study in building a GAN completely free of convolutions, using only pure transformer-based architectures. Our vanilla GAN architecture, dubbed TransGAN, consists of a memory-friendly transformer-based generator that progressively increases feature resolution, and correspondingly a multi-scale discriminator to capture simultaneously semantic contexts and low-level textures. On top of them, we introduce the new module of grid self-attention for alleviating the memory bottleneck further, in order to scale up TransGAN to high-resolution generation. We also develop a unique training recipe including a series of techniques that can mitigate the training instability issues of TransGAN, such as data augmentation, modified normalization, and relative position encoding. Our best architecture achieves highly competitive performance compared to current state-of-the-art GANs using convolutional backbones. Specifically, TransGAN sets new state-of-the-art inception score of 10.43 and FID of 18.28 on STL-10, outperforming StyleGAN-V2. When it comes to higher-resolution (e.g. 256 x 256) generation tasks, such as on CelebA-HQ and LSUN-Church, TransGAN continues to produce diverse visual examples with high fidelity and impressive texture details. In addition, we dive deep into the transformer-based generation models to understand how their behaviors differ from convolutional ones, by visualizing training dynamics.

However, existing approaches have not thoroughly investigated the profound influence of transformers on different MVS modules, resulting in limited depth estimation capabilities. In this paper, we introduce MVSFormer++, a method that prudently maximizes the inherent characteristics of attention to enhance various components of the MVS pipeline. Formally, our approach involves infusing cross-view information into the pre-trained DINOv2 model to facilitate MVS learning. Furthermore, we employ different attention mechanisms for the feature encoder and cost volume regularization, focusing on feature and spatial aggregations respectively. Additionally, we uncover that some design details would substantially impact the performance of transformer modules in MVS, including normalized 3D positional encoding, adaptive attention scaling, and the position of layer normalization. Comprehensive experiments on DTU, Tanks-and-Temples, BlendedMVS, and ETH3D validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Notably, MVSFormer++ achieves state-of-the-art performance on the challenging DTU and Tanks-and-Temples benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Transformer-based and GNN-based methods have shown promising potential due to their strong ability to model interaction of time and variables. However, by conducting a comprehensive analysis of the real-world data, we observe that the temporal fluctuations and heterogeneity between variables are not well handled by existing methods. To address the above issues, we propose CrossGNN, a linear complexity GNN model to refine the cross-scale and cross-variable interaction for MTS. To deal with the unexpected noise in time dimension, an adaptive multi-scale identifier (AMSI) is leveraged to construct multi-scale time series with reduced noise. A Cross-Scale GNN is proposed to extract the scales with clearer trend and weaker noise. Cross-Variable GNN is proposed to utilize the homogeneity and heterogeneity between different variables. By simultaneously focusing on edges with higher saliency scores and constraining those edges with lower scores, the time and space complexity (i.e., O ( L ) ) of CrossGNN can be linear with the input sequence length L . Extensive experimental results on 8 real-world MTS datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CrossGNN compared with state-of-the-art methods.

MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient hierarchical normalization for NLP*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Our core idea is that a foundation model for VRPs should be able to represent variants by treating each as a subset of a generalized problem equipped with different attributes. We propose a unified VRP environment capable of efficiently handling any attribute combination. The RouteFinder model leverages a modern transformer-based encoder and global attribute embeddings to improve task representation. Additionally, we introduce two reinforcement learning techniques to enhance multi-task performance: mixed batch training, which enables training on different variants at once, and multi-variant reward normalization to balance different reward scales. Finally, we propose efficient adapter layers that enable fine-tuning for new variants with unseen attributes. Extensive experiments on 24 VRP variants show RouteFinder achieves competitive results.

SAFIN: Arbitrary Style Transfer With Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale adaptive normalization techniques in transformers*\n\n*Zhangyang Wang, Xinyu Gong, Shreeshail Hingane, Aaditya Singh*\n\n**Abstract:** Artistic style transfer aims to transfer the style characteristics of one image onto another image while retaining its content. Existing approaches commonly leverage various normalization techniques, although these face limitations in adequately transferring diverse textures to different spatial locations. Self-Attention-based approaches have tackled this issue with partial success but suffer from unwanted artifacts. Motivated by these observations, this paper aims to combine the best of both worlds: self-attention and normalization. That yields a new plug-and-play module that we name Self-Attentive Factorized Instance Normalization (SAFIN). SAFIN is essentially a spatially adaptive normalization module whose parameters are inferred through attention on the content and style image. We demonstrate that plugging SAFIN into the base network of another state-of-the-art method results in enhanced stylization. We also develop a novel base network composed of Wavelet Transform for multi-scale style transfer, which when combined with SAFIN, produces visually appealing results with lesser unwanted textures.\n\n**Conference:** safin-arbitrary-style-transfer-with-self-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to develop a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically focusing on enhancing the Root Mean Square Layer Normalization (RMSNorm) with hierarchical and adaptive mechanisms, termed **HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm**.

    "proposal": "# HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm: Multi-Scale Adaptive Normalization for Efficient Language Models\n\n## Motivation\n\nCurrent language models face significant challenges in efficiently processing long sequences while maintaining computational efficiency and model quality. While RMSNorm provides effective normalization, it lacks mechanisms to adapt to varying input complexities and optimize computation across different scales of the input sequence. This limitation can lead to unnecessary computation for simple patterns and insufficient processing for complex ones.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\nStandard RMSNorm has several limitations:\n- Fixed computation regardless of input complexity\n- Uniform processing across all sequence positions\n- Limited ability to capture hierarchical relationships\n- Inefficient memory access patterns\n- Suboptimal hardware utilization\n\n## Core Idea and Philosophy\n\nWe propose enhancing RMSNorm with two key innovations:\n1. Hierarchical Processing: Multi-scale normalization that operates at different granularities\n2. Adaptive Computation: Dynamic adjustment of normalization parameters based on input complexity\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Architecture Overview\n\nHierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm introduces three main components:\n\n1. Multi-Scale Normalization:\n```python\nclass MultiScaleNorm:\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, num_scales=3):\n        self.scales = nn.ModuleList([\n            RMSNorm(embed_dim >> i) \n            for i in range(num_scales)\n        ])\n        self.scale_weights = nn.Parameter(torch.ones(num_scales))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        outputs = []\n        for i, norm in enumerate(self.scales):\n            scale_x = F.avg_pool1d(x.transpose(1,2), 2**i, 2**i).transpose(1,2)\n            norm_x = norm(scale_x)\n            up_x = F.interpolate(norm_x.transpose(1,2), size=x.size(1)).transpose(1,2)\n            outputs.append(up_x * self.scale_weights[i].unsqueeze(-1))\n        return sum(outputs)\n```\n\n2. Adaptive Parameter Adjustment:\n```python\nclass AdaptiveComputation:\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim):\n        self.complexity_estimator = nn.Linear(embed_dim, 1)\n        self.threshold = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Estimate input complexity\n        complexity = torch.sigmoid(self.complexity_estimator(x))\n        \n        # Generate adaptive scaling factors\n        scales = torch.where(\n            complexity > self.threshold,\n            complexity,\n            torch.ones_like(complexity) * 0.1\n        )\n        return scales\n```\n\n3. Hardware-Efficient Implementation:\n```python\nclass HARNBlock:\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim, chunk_size=256):\n        self.chunk_size = chunk_size\n        self.multi_scale = MultiScaleNorm(embed_dim)\n        self.adaptive_comp = AdaptiveComputation(embed_dim)\n        \n    def forward(self, x):\n        # Process in chunks for better memory efficiency\n        chunks = x.split(self.chunk_size, dim=1)\n        outputs = []\n        \n        for chunk in chunks:\n            # Compute adaptive scales\n            scales = self.adaptive_comp(chunk)\n            \n            # Apply multi-scale normalization\n            norm_chunk = self.multi_scale(chunk)\n            \n            # Apply adaptive scaling\n            out_chunk = norm_chunk * scales\n            outputs.append(out_chunk)\n            \n        return torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)\n```\n\n### Mathematical Formulation\n\n1. Multi-Scale Normalization:\nFor each scale s:\n```\nx_s = AvgPool(x, 2^s)\nnorm_s = x_s / sqrt(mean(x_s^2) + eps)\nup_s = Interpolate(norm_s)\ny_s = up_s * w_s\ny = sum(y_s for s in scales)\n```\n\n2. Adaptive Computation:\n```\nc(x) = sigmoid(W_c * x + b_c)\nscale = where(c(x) > threshold, c(x), 0.1)\n```\n\n3. Final Output:\n```\ny = HARN(x) = sum(w_s * Interpolate(RMSNorm(AvgPool(x, 2^s)))) * scale\n```\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n1. Initialization:\n```python\ndef init_harn(config):\n    return HierarchicalAdaptiveRMSNorm(\n        embed_dim=config.hidden_size,\n        num_scales=config.num_scales,\n        chunk_size=config.chunk_size\n    )\n```\n\n2. Memory Management:\n```python\ndef process_sequence(x, chunk_size):\n    # Process in chunks to optimize memory usage\n    chunks = x.split(chunk_size, dim=1)\n    outputs = []\n    \n    for chunk in chunks:\n        processed = process_chunk(chunk)\n        outputs.append(processed)\n        \n    return torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)\n```\n\n3. Hardware Optimization:\n```python\ndef optimize_computation(x, chunk_size):\n    # Ensure chunk size is multiple of 16 for tensor cores\n    chunk_size = (chunk_size // 16) * 16\n    \n    # Use strided memory access for better cache utilization\n    x = x.contiguous()\n    return process_sequence(x, chunk_size)\n```\n\n## Theoretical Analysis\n\n1. Computational Complexity:\n- Base RMSNorm: O(n)\n- Multi-scale processing: O(n log n)\n- Adaptive computation: O(n)\n- Overall: O(n log n)\n\n2. Memory Usage:\n- Reduced by factor of (1/num_scales) through hierarchical processing\n- Constant memory overhead from adaptive computation\n- Chunk-wise processing enables O(1) memory usage\n\n3. Expected Benefits:\n- Better handling of varying input complexities\n- Improved capture of hierarchical relationships\n- More efficient hardware utilization\n- Reduced memory footprint\n\n## Research Summary\n\nKey findings from research:\n1.
