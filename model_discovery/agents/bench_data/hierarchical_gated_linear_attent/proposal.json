However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Learning to Segment from Scribbles using Multi-scale Adversarial Attention Gates\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Gated Attention*\n\n*Gabriele Valvano, Sotirios A. Tsaftaris, Andrea Leo*\n\n**Abstract:** Large, fine-grained image segmentation datasets, annotated at pixel-level, are difficult to obtain, particularly in medical imaging, where annotations also require expert knowledge. Weakly-supervised learning can train models by relying on weaker forms of annotation, such as scribbles. Here, we learn to segment using scribble annotations in an adversarial game. With unpaired segmentation masks, we train a multi-scale GAN to generate realistic segmentation masks at multiple resolutions, while we use scribbles to learn their correct position in the image. Central to the model's success is a novel attention gating mechanism, which we condition with adversarial signals to act as a shape prior, resulting in better object localization at multiple scales. Subject to adversarial conditioning, the segmentor learns attention maps that are semantic, suppress the noisy activations outside the objects, and reduce the vanishing gradient problem in the deeper layers of the segmentor. We evaluated our model on several medical (ACDC, LVSC, CHAOS) and non-medical (PPSS) datasets, and we report performance levels matching those achieved by models trained with fully annotated segmentation masks. We also demonstrate extensions in a variety of settings: semi-supervised learning; combining multiple scribble sources (a crowdsourcing scenario) and multi-task learning (combining scribble and mask supervision). We release expert-made scribble annotations for the ACDC dataset, and the code used for the experiments, at https://vios-s.github.io/multiscale-adversarial-attention-gates\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Unifying and Personalizing Weakly-supervised Federated Medical Image Segmentation via Adaptive Representation and Aggregation\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Gated Attention*\n\n*Xiaoying Tang, Kenneth K. Y. Wong, Yixiang Liu, Jiewei Wu, Li Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) enables multiple sites to collaboratively train powerful deep models without compromising data privacy and security. The statistical heterogeneity (e.g., non-IID data and domain shifts) is a primary obstacle in FL, impairing the generalization performance of the global model. Weakly supervised segmentation, which uses sparsely-grained (i.e., point-, bounding box-, scribble-, block-wise) supervision, is increasingly being paid attention to due to its great potential of reducing annotation costs. However, there may exist label heterogeneity, i.e., different annotation forms across sites. In this paper, we propose a novel personalized FL framework for medical image segmentation, named FedICRA, which uniformly leverages heterogeneous weak supervision via adaptIve Contrastive Representation and Aggregation. Concretely, to facilitate personalized modeling and to avoid confusion, a channel selection based site contrastive representation module is employed to adaptively cluster intra-site embeddings and separate inter-site ones. To effectively integrate the common knowledge from the global model with the unique knowledge from each local model, an adaptive aggregation module is applied for updating and initializing local models at the element level. Additionally, a weakly supervised objective function that leverages a multiscale tree energy loss and a gated CRF loss is employed to generate more precise pseudo-labels and further boost the segmentation performance. Through extensive experiments on two distinct medical image segmentation tasks of different modalities, the proposed FedICRA demonstrates overwhelming performance over other state-of-the-art personalized FL methods. Its performance even approaches that of fully supervised training on centralized data. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/llmir/FedICRA.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates hierarchical state space models with linear attention mechanisms, here are the key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of **attention tensorization** from the first source is particularly relevant. It shows how decomposing long sequences into hierarchical dimensions can improve efficiency and capture multi-hop token interactions more effectively. This approach can be adapted to incorporate gated linear attention within a hierarchical framework.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA)**, as mentioned in the analysis, is crucial for maintaining linear time and space complexity while enhancing expressiveness. The integration of GLA within hierarchical state space models can be inspired by the efficiency and expressiveness of models like those described in the analysis notes.\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n\n- The idea of **hierarchical state space models** from the analysis notes aligns well with the need to capture information at multiple temporal scales. This can be further supported by the concept of hierarchical processing seen in other domains, such as the hierarchical fusion of images, which demonstrates the effectiveness of hierarchical structures in capturing multi-scale dependencies.\n\n### Multiscale Dependency Capture\n\n- The **hierarchical fusion** approach in image processing and the **hierarchical action recognition** model both highlight the benefits of processing data at multiple scales. This can be translated to sequence modeling by using hierarchical state space models to capture both short-term and long-term dependencies.\n\n### Test-Time Training and Adaptability\n\n- The importance of **test-time training capabilities** is emphasized in the analysis. This can be achieved by incorporating mechanisms like those in RWKV, which allow for stateful representations and efficient inference, enabling the model to adapt during inference.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n1. **Integrate Attention Tensorization with Hierarchical State Space Models**:\n   - Use the attention tensorization concept to decompose long sequences into hierarchical dimensions, which can then be processed using gated linear attention within each layer of the hierarchical state space model.\n\n2. **Utilize Gated Linear Attention**:\n   - Embed GLA within each layer to achieve efficient and expressive attention mechanisms. This can be inspired by the Gated Linear Attention Transformers mentioned in the analysis notes.\n\n3. **Leverage Hierarchical Processing**:\n   - Implement a hierarchical structure where lower layers focus on short-term dependencies and higher layers capture long-term dependencies. This is similar to the hierarchical action recognition model and the hierarchical image fusion methods.\n\n4. **Maintain Stateful Representations**:\n   - Incorporate RWKV-like mechanisms to maintain stateful representations, ensuring efficient inference and the ability to handle long sequences without quadratic complexity.\n\n5. **Ensure Computational Efficiency and Numerical Stability**:\n   - Use techniques like causal convolutions, masked attention, and normalization (e.g., RMSNorm) to maintain causality and numerical stability in the deep hierarchical model.\n\n### Future Research Directions\n\n- **Explore Existing Multiscale Models**:\n  - Investigate models like the Perceiver and Funnel Transformer to understand their multiscale processing and attention mechanisms. This can provide insights into how to balance efficiency and expressiveness in the new design.\n\n- **Combine Attention with State Space Models**:\n  - Look for studies that integrate attention mechanisms directly into state space models. Analyze how these models address the challenges of combining global attention with sequential state space models.\n\n- **Study Hierarchical Recurrent Models**:\n  - Examine models like the Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN) to understand how gating at different layers affects information flow and long-range dependency capture.\n\nBy combining these insights, the researcher can design a novel LM block that efficiently captures multiscale dependencies, maintains computational efficiency, and adapts during inference, thereby potentially outperforming existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/8 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu and Tri Dao. 2023.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale State Space Models*\n\n*Yossi Adi, Gabriel Synnaeve, Jade Copet, Alexandre D\u00e9fossez*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a state-of-the-art real-time, high-fidelity, audio codec leveraging neural networks. It consists in a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space trained in an end-to-end fashion. We simplify and speed-up the training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary that efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples. We introduce a novel loss balancer mechanism to stabilize training: the weight of a loss now defines the fraction of the overall gradient it should represent, thus decoupling the choice of this hyper-parameter from the typical scale of the loss. Finally, we study how lightweight Transformer models can be used to further compress the obtained representation by up to 40%, while staying faster than real time. We provide a detailed description of the key design choices of the proposed model including: training objective, architectural changes and a study of various perceptual loss functions. We present an extensive subjective evaluation (MUSHRA tests) together with an ablation study for a range of bandwidths and audio domains, including speech, noisy-reverberant speech, and music. Our approach is superior to the baselines methods across all evaluated settings, considering both 24 kHz monophonic and 48 kHz stereophonic audio.

Scalable High-Resolution Pixel-Space Image Synthesis with Hourglass Diffusion Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale State Space Models*\n\n*Enrico Shippole, Daniel Z. Kaplan, Tanishq Mathew Abraham, Alex Birch, Stefan Andreas Baumann, Katherine Crowson*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), an image generative model that exhibits linear scaling with pixel count, supporting training at high-resolution (e.g. $1024 \\times 1024$) directly in pixel-space. Building on the Transformer architecture, which is known to scale to billions of parameters, it bridges the gap between the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets and the scalability of Transformers. HDiT trains successfully without typical high-resolution training techniques such as multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders or self-conditioning. We demonstrate that HDiT performs competitively with existing models on ImageNet $256^2$, and sets a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-$1024^2$.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Attention*\n\n*Hang Yang, Yubo Chen, Yantao Jia, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2018-10\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Hierarchical Attention for Image Captioning\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Gated Attention*\n\n*Antoni B. Chan, Qingzhong Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention modules connecting encoder and decoders have been widely applied in\nthe field of object recognition, image captioning, visual question answering\nand neural machine translation, and significantly improves the performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a bottom-up gated hierarchical attention (GHA) mechanism\nfor image captioning. Our proposed model employs a CNN as the decoder which is\nable to learn different concepts at different layers, and apparently, different\nconcepts correspond to different areas of an image. Therefore, we develop the\nGHA in which low-level concepts are merged into high-level concepts and\nsimultaneously low-level attended features pass to the top to make predictions.\nOur GHA significantly improves the performance of the model that only applies\none level attention, for example, the CIDEr score increases from 0.923 to\n0.999, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art models that employ\nattributes boosting and reinforcement learning (RL). We also conduct extensive\nexperiments to analyze the CNN decoder and our proposed GHA, and we find that\ndeeper decoders cannot obtain better performance, and when the convolutional\ndecoder becomes deeper the model is likely to collapse during training.\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-30\n\n\n\n#### 5. Mamba or RWKV: Exploring High-Quality and High-Efficiency Segment Anything Model\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Multiscale Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Chen Change Loy, Shuicheng Yan, Ming-Hsuan Yang, Tao Zhang, Lu Qi, Xiangtai Li, Haobo Yuan*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based segmentation methods face the challenge of efficient inference when dealing with high-resolution images. Recently, several linear attention architectures, such as Mamba and RWKV, have attracted much attention as they can process long sequences efficiently. In this work, we focus on designing an efficient segment-anything model by exploring these different architectures. Specifically, we design a mixed backbone that contains convolution and RWKV operation, which achieves the best for both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we design an efficient decoder to utilize the multiscale tokens to obtain high-quality masks. We denote our method as RWKV-SAM, a simple, effective, fast baseline for SAM-like models. Moreover, we build a benchmark containing various high-quality segmentation datasets and jointly train one efficient yet high-quality segmentation model using this benchmark. Based on the benchmark results, our RWKV-SAM achieves outstanding performance in efficiency and segmentation quality compared to transformers and other linear attention models. For example, compared with the same-scale transformer model, RWKV-SAM achieves more than 2x speedup and can achieve better segmentation performance on various datasets. In addition, RWKV-SAM outperforms recent vision Mamba models with better classification and semantic segmentation results. Code and models will be publicly available.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 6. Sequence Modeling with Multiresolution Convolutional Memory\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Multiscale Sequence Modeling*\n\n*Emily B. Fox, Ke Alexander Wang, Jiaxin Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently capturing the long-range patterns in sequential data sources salient to a given task -- such as classification and generative modeling -- poses a fundamental challenge. Popular approaches in the space tradeoff between the memory burden of brute-force enumeration and comparison, as in transformers, the computational burden of complicated sequential dependencies, as in recurrent neural networks, or the parameter burden of convolutional networks with many or large filters. We instead take inspiration from wavelet-based multiresolution analysis to define a new building block for sequence modeling, which we call a MultiresLayer. The key component of our model is the multiresolution convolution, capturing multiscale trends in the input sequence. Our MultiresConv can be implemented with shared filters across a dilated causal convolution tree. Thus it garners the computational advantages of convolutional networks and the principled theoretical motivation of wavelet decompositions. Our MultiresLayer is straightforward to implement, requires significantly fewer parameters, and maintains at most a $\\mathcal{O}(N\\log N)$ memory footprint for a length $N$ sequence. Yet, by stacking such layers, our model yields state-of-the-art performance on a number of sequence classification and autoregressive density estimation tasks using CIFAR-10, ListOps, and PTB-XL datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block that integrates hierarchical state space models with gated linear attention mechanisms, here are the most relevant and useful insights and information from the provided sources:\n\n### Key Components and Mechanisms\n\n1. **Hierarchical State Space Models (HiSSM):**\n   - The researcher aims to use hierarchical structures to process sequences at different temporal scales. Studies like \"Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\" by Bhirangi et al. (2024) and \"Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\" by Qin et al. (2024) provide insights into how hierarchical models can capture both short-term and long-term dependencies efficiently.\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention (GLA):**\n   - GLA introduces data-dependent gates that modulate attention weights, enhancing expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity. This is detailed in \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" by Yang et al. (2023) and aligns with the researcher's goal of combining GLA with hierarchical state space models.\n\n3. **Efficient Sequence Modeling:**\n   - State Space Models (SSMs) like Mamba and S4 models are highlighted for their ability to handle long sequences with linear time complexity. These models use selective state spaces and data-dependent SSM layers, which can be integrated into the hierarchical design to improve efficiency and context compression.\n\n### Integration and Design Considerations\n\n1. **Combining GLA with Hierarchical SSMs:**\n   - Embedding GLA within each layer of a hierarchical state space model can enhance the modeling of multiscale dependencies. This approach is supported by the unified implicit attention formulation proposed by Zimerman et al. (2024), which views gated linear recurrent models as implicit self-attention layers.\n\n2. **RWKV and Stateful Representations:**\n   - RWKV's approach to maintaining stateful representations without quadratic complexity can be integrated into hierarchical models. This ensures efficient recursive updates across layers, which is crucial for long sequences.\n\n3. **Causality and Computational Efficiency:**\n   - Ensuring causality in hierarchical attention mechanisms is vital. Methods such as causal convolutions and appropriate masking techniques need to be explored to maintain the autoregressive properties of the model. Efficient implementations, such as those described in \"Improving Efficiency in Sequence Models\" by Restackio, can help mitigate computational load.\n\n### Potential Design and Challenges\n\n1. **Hierarchical Gated Linear Attention Unit (H-GLAU):**\n   - The proposed H-GLAU structure involves multiple hierarchical layers with GLA mechanisms. This design captures multiscale dependencies, maintains linear complexity, and preserves test-time training capabilities. However, challenges such as computational efficiency, numerical stability, and integration complexity need to be addressed.\n\n2. **Efficient Implementation Techniques:**\n   - Studying efficient algorithm implementations, such as the parallel scan algorithm mentioned in Restackio, can help optimize GPU memory usage and improve training and inference speed.\n\n3. **Causality Enforcement:**\n   - Researching methods to enforce causality, such as those discussed in the context of RWKV and other hierarchical models, is essential to ensure the model's autoregressive properties are maintained.\n\n### Next Steps and Future Research\n\n1. **Further Research on Multiscale State Space Models:**\n   - Investigate recent developments in multiscale or hierarchical state space models, focusing on efficient combinations with attention mechanisms. This includes exploring models like Mamba, S4, and HiSSM.\n\n2. **Deepen Understanding of Integration Methods:**\n   - Explore how other models have combined attention mechanisms with state space models, and investigate the use of causal convolutions and masking techniques in hierarchical models.\n\n3. **Refine Design Concepts:**\n   - Based on new findings, refine the architectural design of the proposed GAU to ensure alignment with the goals of efficiency, scalability, and expressiveness. This involves identifying how existing units from parent designs can be reused and integrated effectively.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient novel autoregressive LM block that leverages the strengths of hierarchical state space models and gated linear attention mechanisms.\n",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[11] Daniel Y.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv.org, abs/2112.10740, 12 2021.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).

Computation. After the parameters have been transformed from $(\\Delta, A, B, C) \\mapsto(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, C)$, the model can be computed in two ways, either as a linear recurrence (2) or a global convolution (3). Commonly, the model uses the convolutional mode (3) for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (2) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one timestep at a time). Linear Time Invariance (LTI). An important property of equations (1) to (3) is that the model's dynamics are constant through time. In other words $(\\Delta, A, B, C)$, and consequently $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ as well, are fixed for all time-steps. This property is\ncalled linear time invariance ( $L T I$ ), which is deeply connected to recurrence and convolutions. Informally, we think of LTI SSMs as being equivalent to any linear recurrence (2a) or convolution (3b), and use LTI as an umbrella term for these classes of models. Thus far, all structured SSMs have been LTI (e.g. computed as convolutions) because of fundamental efficiency constraints, discussed in Section 3.3. However, a core insight of this work is that LTI models have fundamental limitations in modeling certain types of data, and our technical contributions involve removing the LTI constraint while overcoming the efficiency bottlenecks. Structure and Dimensions. Finally, we note that structured SSMs are so named because computing them efficiently also requires imposing structure on the $A$ matrix. The most popular form of structure is diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which we also use. In this case, the $\\boldsymbol{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}, \\boldsymbol{B} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times 1}, \\boldsymbol{C} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{1 \\times N}$ matrices can all be represented by $N$ numbers. To operate over an input sequence $x$ of batch size $B$ and length $L$ with $D$ channels, the SSM is applied independently to each channel. Note that in this case, the total hidden state has dimension $D N$ per input, and computing it over the sequence length requires $O(B L D N)$ time and memory; this is the root of the fundamental efficiency bottleneck addressed in Section 3.3. General State Space Models. We note that the term state space model has a very broad meaning which simply represents the notion of any recurrent process with a latent state. It has been used to refer to many disparate concepts in different disciplines, including Markov decision processes (MDP) (reinforcement learning (Hafner et al. 2020)), dynamic causal modeling (DCM) (computational neuroscience (Friston, Harrison, and Penny 2003)), Kalman filters (controls (Kalman 1960)), hidden Markov models (HMM) and linear dynamical systems (LDS) (machine learning), and recurrent (and sometimes convolutional) models at large (deep learning). Throughout this entire paper we use the term \"SSM\" to refer exclusively to the class of structured SSMs or S4 models (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Efficient Time-Varying State Space Models, Hardware-Aware Sequence Models, Linear Complexity Autoregressive Models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

In this work, we investigate a set of RL techniques for the full-length game of StarCraft II. We investigate a hierarchical RL approach involving extracted macro-actions and a hierarchical architecture of neural networks. We investigate a curriculum transfer training procedure and train the agent on a single machine with 4 GPUs and 48 CPU threads. On a 64x64 map and using restrictive units, we achieve a win rate of 99% against the level-1 built-in AI. Through the curriculum transfer learning algorithm and a mixture of combat models, we achieve a 93% win rate against the most difficult non-cheating level built-in AI (level-7). In this extended version of the paper, we improve our architecture to train the agent against the cheating level AIs and achieve the win rate against the level-8, level-9, and level-10 AIs as 96%, 97%, and 94%, respectively. Our codes are at https://github.com/liuruoze/HierNet-SC2. To provide a baseline referring the AlphaStar for our work as well as the research and open-source community, we reproduce a scaled-down version of it, mini-AlphaStar (mAS). The latest version of mAS is 1.07, which can be trained on the raw action space which has 564 actions. It is designed to run training on a single common machine, by making the hyper-parameters adjustable. We then compare our work with mAS using the same resources and show that our method is more effective. The codes of mini-AlphaStar are at https://github.com/liuruoze/mini-AlphaStar.

Motion Mamba: Efficient and Long Sequence Motion Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient Time-Varying State Space Models*\n\n*Hao Tang, Bohan Zhuang, Richard Hartley, Ian Reid, Akide Liu, Zeyu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human motion generation stands as a significant pursuit in generative computer vision, while achieving long-sequence and efficient motion generation remains challenging. Recent advancements in state space models (SSMs), notably Mamba, have showcased considerable promise in long sequence modeling with an efficient hardware-aware design, which appears to be a promising direction to build motion generation model upon it. Nevertheless, adapting SSMs to motion generation faces hurdles since the lack of a specialized design architecture to model motion sequence. To address these challenges, we propose Motion Mamba, a simple and efficient approach that presents the pioneering motion generation model utilized SSMs. Specifically, we design a Hierarchical Temporal Mamba (HTM) block to process temporal data by ensemble varying numbers of isolated SSM modules across a symmetric U-Net architecture aimed at preserving motion consistency between frames. We also design a Bidirectional Spatial Mamba (BSM) block to bidirectionally process latent poses, to enhance accurate motion generation within a temporal frame. Our proposed method achieves up to 50% FID improvement and up to 4 times faster on the HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets compared to the previous best diffusion-based method, which demonstrates strong capabilities of high-quality long sequence motion modeling and real-time human motion generation.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-Aware Sequence Models*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 5.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n**Conference:** an-attention-free-transformer\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. End-to-end LPCNet: A Neural Vocoder With Fully-Differentiable LPC Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Complexity Autoregressive Models*\n\n*Arvindh Krishnaswamy, Paris Smaragdis, Umut Isik, Jean-Marc Valin, Krishna Subramani*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural vocoders have recently demonstrated high quality speech synthesis, but typically require a high computational complexity. LPCNet was proposed as a way to reduce the complexity of neural synthesis by using linear prediction (LP) to assist an autoregressive model. At inference time, LPCNet relies on the LP coefficients being explicitly computed from the input acoustic features. That makes the design of LPCNet-based systems more complicated, while adding the constraint that the input features must represent a clean speech spectrum. We propose an end-to-end version of LPCNet that lifts these limitations by learning to infer the LP coefficients from the input features in the frame rate network. Results show that the proposed end-to-end approach equals or exceeds the quality of the original LPCNet model, but without explicit LP analysis. Our open-source end-to-end model still benefits from LPCNet's low complexity, while allowing for any type of conditioning features.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher is aiming to design a novel autoregressive language model block that integrates hierarchical state space models with gated linear attention mechanisms, ensuring both computational efficiency and the ability to capture long-term dependencies. Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n### Key Components and Goals\n\n1. **Hierarchical State Space Models**:\n   - The researcher wants to incorporate hierarchical structures to model both short-term and long-term dependencies, similar to the Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN).\n\n2. **Gated Linear Attention**:\n   - Integrating gated linear attention mechanisms, such as those in Mamba, to enhance the model's ability to compress context and perform content-based reasoning.\n\n3. **Computational Efficiency**:\n   - Ensuring linear time and space complexity, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently. This involves using techniques like parallel scan algorithms and hardware-aware optimizations.\n\n4. **Maintaining Causality**:\n   - The model must maintain causality, which is essential for autoregressive language modeling. Methods such as causal masking and causal convolutions can be employed.\n\n### Useful Information\n\n#### Efficient Computation Techniques\n\n- **Parallel Scan Algorithm**:\n  - This algorithm, discussed in the Restack.io article, allows for efficient computation of certain recurrent computations with O(n) time and O(log n) memory. This can be particularly useful for handling time-varying SSMs.\n\n- **Selective State Space Models (SSMs)**:\n  - The Taipan model introduces a combination of Selective Attention and Sliding Window Attention, which enhances computational efficiency by producing a sparser attention weight map. This approach allows for longer sliding windows to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n#### Addressing Time-Varying SSMs\n\n- **Mamba and Taipan Models**:\n  - These models incorporate input-dependent parameters into SSMs, which complicates efficient computation due to the inability to use convolutions.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/37 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.02789 (2018).

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 34/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and TransNormerLLM (Qin, Dong Li, et al. 2023) generalize Linear Attention using decay terms instead of a cumulative sum, and propose dual parallel/recurrent algorithms as well as a hybrid \"chunkwise\" mode. These algorithms can be seen as an instantiation of SSD where $A_{t}$ is time-invariant (constant for all $t$ ); in the SMA interpretation, the mask matrix $L$ would be a decay matrix $L_{i, j}=\\gamma^{i-j}$. These models also differ architecturally in\nvarious ways. For example, since they were derived from an attention-centric perspective they preserve the multi-head attention (MHA) pattern; since Mamba-2 was derived from an SSM-centric pattern it preserves the multi-value attention (MVA) or multi-expand SSM (MES) pattern, which we show to be better (Section 9.4). - GateLoop (Katsch 2023) concurrently proposed using input-dependent decay factors $A_{t}$, and developed the same dual quadratic form as in SSD which they call a \"surrogate attention\" form. - Gated Linear Attention (GLA) (Yang et al. 2024) proposed a variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates, along with efficient algorithms to compute a chunkwise mode and hardware-aware implementations. - HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023) introduced an RNN with input-dependent gates, which was improved to incorporate state expansion in HGRN2 (Qin, Yang, Weixuan Sun, et al.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

(2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

MambaClinix: Hierarchical Gated Convolution and Mamba-Based U-Net for Enhanced 3D Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Qian Dong, Bin Wei, Fengjiao Wang, Feifei Wang, Xia Yang, Nan Xia, Chenyuan Bian*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, has significantly advanced 3D medical image segmentation. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing local features, their limited receptive fields may hinder performance in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive, making them expensive to train and deploy. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on the State Space Model (SSM), has been proposed to efficiently model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. However, its application in medical image segmentation reveals shortcomings, particularly in capturing critical local features essential for accurate delineation of clinical regions. In this study, we propose MambaClinix, a novel U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation that integrates a hierarchical gated convolutional network(HGCN) with Mamba in an adaptive stage-wise framework. This design significantly enhances computational efficiency and high-order spatial interactions, enabling the model to effectively capture both proximal and distal relationships in medical images. Specifically, our HGCN is designed to mimic the attention mechanism of Transformers by a purely convolutional structure, facilitating high-order spatial interactions in feature maps while avoiding the computational complexity typically associated with Transformer-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific Tversky loss, which emphasizes specific pixel regions to improve auto-segmentation performance, thereby optimizing the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MambaClinix achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba-Spike: Enhancing the Mamba Architecture with a Spiking Front-End for Efficient Temporal Data Processing\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Feng Liu, Jiahao Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** The field of neuromorphic computing has gained significant attention in recent years, aiming to bridge the gap between the efficiency of biological neural networks and the performance of artificial intelligence systems. This paper introduces Mamba-Spike, a novel neuromorphic architecture that integrates a spiking front-end with the Mamba backbone to achieve efficient and robust temporal data processing. The proposed approach leverages the event-driven nature of spiking neural networks (SNNs) to capture and process asynchronous, time-varying inputs, while harnessing the power of the Mamba backbone's selective state spaces and linear-time sequence modeling capabilities to model complex temporal dependencies effectively. The spiking front-end of Mamba-Spike employs biologically inspired neuron models, along with adaptive threshold and synaptic dynamics. These components enable efficient spatiotemporal feature extraction and encoding of the input data. The Mamba backbone, on the other hand, utilizes a hierarchical structure with gated recurrent units and attention mechanisms to capture long-term dependencies and selectively process relevant information. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed architecture, a comprehensive empirical study is conducted on both neuromorphic datasets, including DVS Gesture and TIDIGITS, and standard datasets, such as Sequential MNIST and CIFAR10-DVS. The results demonstrate that Mamba-Spike consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy, lower latency, and improved energy efficiency. Moreover, the model exhibits robustness to various input perturbations and noise levels, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.

Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Multiscale Linear Attention Models*\n\n*Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Huakun Luo, Tengge Hu, Haixu Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep models have achieved impressive progress in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to approximate the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have explored the multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are limited to learning the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real physical science problems, PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical solvers relying on discretization into high-dimensional coordinate space, which cannot be precisely approximated by a single operator nor efficiently learned due to the curse of dimensionality. We present Latent Spectral Models (LSM) toward an efficient and precise solver for high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based hierarchical projection network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact latent space in linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, we design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation. Experimentally, LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged on seven benchmarks covering both solid and fluid physics.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency,\n  Performance, and Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention*\n\n*Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance\nperformance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of\nthese models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to\ninvestigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models\nwith varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear\nAttention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and\nAdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 4. A Multiscale Visualization of Attention in the Transformer Model\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Attention Models*\n\n*Jesse Vig*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer is a sequence model that forgoes traditional recurrent architectures in favor of a fully attention-based approach. Besides improving performance, an advantage of using attention is that it can also help to interpret a model by showing how the model assigns weight to different input elements. However, the multi-layer, multi-head attention mechanism in the Transformer model can be difficult to decipher. To make the model more accessible, we introduce an open-source tool that visualizes attention at multiple scales, each of which provides a unique perspective on the attention mechanism. We demonstrate the tool on BERT and OpenAI GPT-2 and present three example use cases: detecting model bias, locating relevant attention heads, and linking neurons to model behavior.\n\n**Conference:** a-multiscale-visualization-of-attention-in-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. SegFormer: Simple and Efficient Design for Semantic Segmentation with Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Attention Models*\n\n*Ping Luo, Jose M. Alvarez, Anima Anandkumar, Zhiding Yu, Wenhai Wang, Enze Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SegFormer, a simple, efficient yet powerful semantic segmentation framework which unifies Transformers with lightweight multilayer perception (MLP) decoders. SegFormer has two appealing features: 1) SegFormer comprises a novel hierarchically structured Transformer encoder which outputs multiscale features. It does not need positional encoding, thereby avoiding the interpolation of positional codes which leads to decreased performance when the testing resolution differs from training. 2) SegFormer avoids complex decoders. The proposed MLP decoder aggregates information from different layers, and thus combining both local attention and global attention to render powerful representations. We show that this simple and lightweight design is the key to efficient segmentation on Transformers. We scale our approach up to obtain a series of models from SegFormer-B0 to SegFormer-B5, reaching significantly better performance and efficiency than previous counterparts. For example, SegFormer-B4 achieves 50.3% mIoU on ADE20K with 64M parameters, being 5x smaller and 2.2% better than the previous best method. Our best model, SegFormer-B5, achieves 84.0% mIoU on Cityscapes validation set and shows excellent zero-shot robustness on Cityscapes-C.

Current literature does not show any explicit combination of these two techniques for language modeling.\n\n## Effectiveness in Capturing Dependencies\n- Combining GLA with HSSMs could effectively capture both local and global dependencies. GLA enhances linear attention with data-dependent gates, improving expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity. HSSMs allow for modeling at different temporal scales, which can enhance the model's ability to capture multiscale dependencies.\n\n## Potential Challenges\n- **Numerical Stability**: Hierarchical SSMs may suffer from stability issues, particularly when stacking multiple layers. Careful initialization and regularization techniques might be necessary.\n- **Training Complexity**: The integration may introduce complexities in training dynamics, requiring careful hyperparameter tuning and possibly specialized optimization algorithms.\n- **Implementation Feasibility**: Ensuring efficient implementation to maintain linear time and space complexity is crucial. This might involve leveraging hardware-efficient training algorithms and optimized attention mechanisms.\n\n## Comparative Analysis\n- **S4 Model**: While S4 efficiently models long sequences using state space models, it does not integrate GLA. Comparing H-GLAT with S4 can highlight the benefits of adding gated linear attention.\n- **Mega**: Mega uses moving average and gating in attention but does not employ hierarchical SSMs. This difference can be a point of comparison to see how H-GLAT's hierarchical structure enhances performance.\n- **RWKV**: RWKV combines RNNs with Transformers using linear attention but lacks hierarchical state space modeling. Comparing H-GLAT with RWKV can show the advantages of integrating HSSMs.\n\n## Alignment with Research Trends\n- There is a growing interest in efficient models that can handle long sequences and capture multiscale dependencies. The H-GLAT proposal aligns with current trends in improving model scalability and efficiency while maintaining or enhancing performance.\n\n## Useful References and Insights\n\n### Gated Linear Attention\n- Yang et al. (2023) introduce Gated Linear Attention Transformers, which enhance linear attention with data-dependent gates. This work is relevant for understanding how GLA can be integrated into the H-GLAT architecture.\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n- Gu et al. (2022) propose the S4 model, which uses structured state spaces to efficiently model long sequences. This work can provide insights into how state space models can be hierarchical and efficient.\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\n- Michaud et al. (2023) discuss hierarchical Transformers that process information at multiple levels of abstraction, improving efficiency and the ability to model long-range dependencies. This is relevant for understanding the hierarchical aspect of H-GLAT.\n\n### Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Networks\n- Qin et al. (2023) introduce HGRN, which uses hierarchical gating mechanisms to capture dependencies at different temporal scales. This work can provide insights into how hierarchical gating can be implemented in H-GLAT.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Publications**: Search for the latest research (2023 onwards) to see if any new models have combined GLA with hierarchical or multiscale state space models.\n- **Workshops and Conferences**: Review proceedings from recent AI and NLP conferences to find emerging research in efficient multiscale modeling.\n- **Implementations**: Look for open-source implementations or code repositories that might indicate practical applications of similar concepts.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to develop, evaluate, and refine the H-GLAT model, ensuring it meets the criteria of novelty, effectiveness, and alignment with current research trends.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 4 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical Models, Hierarchical Gated Linear Attention, Multiscale Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training.

MambaClinix: Hierarchical Gated Convolution and Mamba-Based U-Net for Enhanced 3D Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical Models*\n\n*Qian Dong, Bin Wei, Fengjiao Wang, Feifei Wang, Xia Yang, Nan Xia, Chenyuan Bian*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and Transformers, has significantly advanced 3D medical image segmentation. While CNNs are highly effective at capturing local features, their limited receptive fields may hinder performance in complex clinical scenarios. In contrast, Transformers excel at modeling long-range dependencies but are computationally intensive, making them expensive to train and deploy. Recently, the Mamba architecture, based on the State Space Model (SSM), has been proposed to efficiently model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. However, its application in medical image segmentation reveals shortcomings, particularly in capturing critical local features essential for accurate delineation of clinical regions. In this study, we propose MambaClinix, a novel U-shaped architecture for medical image segmentation that integrates a hierarchical gated convolutional network(HGCN) with Mamba in an adaptive stage-wise framework. This design significantly enhances computational efficiency and high-order spatial interactions, enabling the model to effectively capture both proximal and distal relationships in medical images. Specifically, our HGCN is designed to mimic the attention mechanism of Transformers by a purely convolutional structure, facilitating high-order spatial interactions in feature maps while avoiding the computational complexity typically associated with Transformer-based methods. Additionally, we introduce a region-specific Tversky loss, which emphasizes specific pixel regions to improve auto-segmentation performance, thereby optimizing the model's decision-making process. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed MambaClinix achieves high segmentation accuracy while maintaining low model complexity.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multiattention network for semantic segmentation of fine-resolution remote sensing images\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Peter M. Atkinson, Libo Wang, Jianlin Su, Chenxi Duan, Ce Zhang, Shunyi Zheng, Rui Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Semantic segmentation of remote sensing images plays an important role in a wide range of applications, including land resource management, biosphere monitoring, and urban planning. Although the accuracy of semantic segmentation in remote sensing images has been increased significantly by deep convolutional neural networks, several limitations exist in standard models. First, for encoder\u2013decoder architectures such as U-Net, the utilization of multiscale features causes the underuse of information, where low-level features and high-level features are concatenated directly without any refinement. Second, long-range dependencies of feature maps are insufficiently explored, resulting in suboptimal feature representations associated with each semantic class. Third, even though the dot-product attention mechanism has been introduced and utilized in semantic segmentation to model long-range dependencies, the large time and space demands of attention impede the actual usage of attention in application scenarios with large-scale input. This article proposed a multiattention network (MANet) to address these issues by extracting contextual dependencies through multiple efficient attention modules. A novel attention mechanism of kernel attention with linear complexity is proposed to alleviate the large computational demand in attention. Based on kernel attention and channel attention, we integrate local feature maps extracted by ResNet-50 with their corresponding global dependencies and reweight interdependent channel maps adaptively. Numerical experiments on two large-scale fine-resolution remote sensing datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MANet.

P-MSDiff: Parallel Multi-Scale Diffusion for Remote Sensing Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Multiscale Linear Attention Mechanisms*\n\n*Qinglin Liu, Kang Li, Zhaodi Li, Pengbo Zhou, Longquan Yan, Guohua Geng, Qi Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models and multi-scale features are essential components in semantic segmentation tasks that deal with remote-sensing images. They contribute to improved segmentation boundaries and offer significant contextual information. U-net-like architectures are frequently employed in diffusion models for segmentation tasks. These architectural designs include dense skip connections that may pose challenges for interpreting intermediate features. Consequently, they might not efficiently convey semantic information throughout various layers of the encoder-decoder architecture. To address these challenges, we propose a new model for semantic segmentation known as the diffusion model with parallel multi-scale branches. This model consists of Parallel Multiscale Diffusion modules (P-MSDiff) and a Cross-Bridge Linear Attention mechanism (CBLA). P-MSDiff enhances the understanding of semantic information across multiple levels of granularity and detects repetitive distribution data through the integration of recursive denoising branches. It further facilitates the amalgamation of data by connecting relevant branches to the primary framework to enable concurrent denoising. Furthermore, within the interconnected transformer architecture, the LA module has been substituted with the CBLA module. This module integrates a semidefinite matrix linked to the query into the dot product computation of keys and values. This integration enables the adaptation of queries within the LA framework. This adjustment enhances the structure for multi-head attention computation, leading to enhanced network performance and CBLA is a plug-and-play module.

Here are the key points and the most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Key Components of H-GLAT\n\n- **Gated Linear Attention (GLA):** This component is crucial for efficient and expressive attention mechanisms. The work by Yang et al. (2023) on \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\" provides valuable insights into how GLA can be implemented efficiently and effectively.\n\n- **Hierarchical State Space Models (HSSMs):** These models are designed to capture multiscale dependencies. The paper by Bhirangi et al. (2024) on \"Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\" is particularly relevant as it discusses the benefits of stacking structured state-space models to create a temporal hierarchy.\n\n## Similar and Relevant Works\n\n- **Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (HGRN and HGRN2):** These models use hierarchical gating mechanisms in RNNs, which is similar to the hierarchical approach in H-GLAT. Qin et al.'s works on HGRN and HGRN2 provide insights into how hierarchical gating can be implemented effectively.\n\n- **DenseMamba:** This approach enhances state space models with dense connections, which could be compared to the hierarchical connections in H-GLAT. He et al.'s work on DenseMamba highlights the importance of inter-layer connections in state space models.\n\n## Novelty and Distinguishing Features\n\n- The unique aspect of H-GLAT is the explicit integration of GLA within a hierarchical SSM framework. This distinguishes it from other models like HGRN/HGRN2, which focus on recurrent architectures, and DenseMamba, which enhances SSMs with dense connections but does not use GLA.\n\n## Potential Benefits and Challenges\n\n- **Benefits:**\n  - Combining GLA with hierarchical structures could capture multiscale dependencies more effectively.\n  - GLA provides data-dependent gating, enhancing expressiveness without sacrificing efficiency.\n  - Hierarchical SSMs allow modeling at different temporal scales, potentially improving long-range dependency modeling.\n\n- **Challenges:**\n  - Numerical stability issues may arise in hierarchical SSMs, and careful design of state update equations and gating mechanisms is necessary.\n  - The integration of GLA into hierarchical layers might increase the model's depth and parameter count, impacting training time and resources. Specialized training techniques or regularization methods may be required.\n\n## Alignment with Research Trends\n\n- The proposal aligns with the trend toward efficient sequence modeling that captures long-range dependencies without quadratic complexity. The emphasis on hardware-efficient training and inference matches industry needs for scalable language models.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n### Deep Dive into HiSS and Similar Models\n\n- Investigate whether HiSS or subsequent works have explored integrating attention mechanisms, particularly GLA, into hierarchical SSMs. Look for open-source implementations or benchmarks.\n\n### Additional Literature on GLA in Hierarchical Models\n\n- Search for recent papers (2023-2024) that discuss using GLA within hierarchical or multiscale architectures. Use keywords like \"Gated Linear Attention Hierarchical Models,\" \"Multiscale Linear Attention Mechanisms,\" and \"Hierarchical Linear Attention.\"\n\n### Exploring Alternative Hierarchical Attention Models\n\n- Look into models like \"MEGA\" and any advancements that may have integrated GLA or similar mechanisms into hierarchical frameworks.\n\n### Potential Authors and Research Groups\n\n- Review works by researchers active in GLA and SSMs, such as Albert Gu, Songlin Yang, and Zhen Qin, for any unpublished or in-progress work.\n\n## Useful References\n\n1. **Yang et al., 2023**: *Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training.* This work provides insights into the effectiveness and efficiency of GLA.\n2. **Bhirangi et al., 2024**: *Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling.* This paper discusses the benefits of hierarchical state space models.\n3. **Qin et al., 2024**: *HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion.* This work enhances hierarchical gating in RNNs and employs linear attention forms.\n4. **He et al., 2024**: *DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models.* This approach enhances state space models with dense connections.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can refine the H-GLAT proposal, ensure it is novel and effective, and align it with the latest advancements in the field.\n",

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Weixuan Sun, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Weigao Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size of HGRN can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters, and allows for hardware-efficient training.\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN,Qin et al. 2023) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling, while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nQin et al. (2023c) is largely based on this work with several adaptations and highlights the importance of data-dependent decay. De et al. (2024) build their model on LRU (Orvieto et al., 2023) and replace data-independent decays with datadependent ones. They further use sliding-window attention to boost the performance. These models are limited in recurrent state size. Gated recurrent models with matrix-valued recurrent state have been investigated in the literature of Neural Turing Machine (NTM Graves et al. 2014) and linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). In NTM, the number of memory slots can be regarded as the state expansion ratio discussed in this work. NTM also included data-dependent decays in the form of erase vectors. However, NTM is hard to parallelize and thus slow to train in practice. The linear transformer is known to have the recurrent form (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) and is known to be closely related to fast weight programming (FWP Schlag et al. 2021). Gated FWPs have been investigated since Schlag \\& Schmidhuber (2017); Zhang \\& Zhou (2017), and have recently been revisited in Peng et al. (2021); Mao (2022); Yang et al. (2023); Katsch (2023); Pramanik et al. (2023). In particular, Yang et al. (2023) proposed a hardware-efficient training algorithm for these types of models. More recently, Mamba2 (Dao \\& Gu, 2024), xLSTM (Beck et al. 2024), and Gated Retention (Sun et al. 2024b) have shown that sharing data-dependent decays across different dimensions within the same head is effective. This approach improves efficiency over GLA because intra-chunk computations are more amenable to tensor core-based matrix multiplication acceleration, at the cost of sacrificing the fine-grainedness of decays. In GLA/HGRN2, each head dimension has its own decay rate, whereas in Mamba2/xLSTM/Gated Retention, all dimensions share the decay under a single head. It is an interesting question to study how much improvement fine-grained decay will bring. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nIn this work, we propose HGRN2, an enhancement of HGRN (Qin et al., 2023c) using an outer product-based state expansion mechanism inspired by linear attention, enabling efficient training. Experiments across multiple tasks validate the advantages of HGRN2 over HGRN1. ## Acknowledgement\n\nWe thank Yu Zhang for conducting some language modeling experiments and for the valuable discussions. ## References\n\nAmeen Ali, Itamar Zimerman, and Lior Wolf.

(2017) gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture the authors call a spectral state space model.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies sequence modeling for prediction tasks with long range dependencies. We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice.

Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention State Space Models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Linear Attention State Space Models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Transformers*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Transformers*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Transformers excel at modeling complex dependencies but suffer from quadratic time and space complexity concerning sequence length. State space models (SSMs) like Mamba offer linear complexity but may lack expressiveness for long-range dependencies. Gated Linear Attention (GLA) provides linear attention mechanisms with enhanced expressiveness through data-dependent gates.\n\nOur goal is to design a novel language model block\u2014the **Hierarchical Gated Linear Attention Unit (H-GLAT)**\u2014that combines hierarchical state space models with GLA to efficiently capture both local and global dependencies in sequences while maintaining linear complexity and robustness. By integrating the strengths of FastTTTLinear (Parent 1) and HierarchicalMamba (Parent 2), we aim to create a model that leverages proven components to enhance performance on long sequences without significant computational overhead.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### Gated Linear Attention (GLA)\n\n- **Yang et al.
