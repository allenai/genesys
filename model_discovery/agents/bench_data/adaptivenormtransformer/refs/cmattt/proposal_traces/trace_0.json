Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.44)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices.

A Comparative Study on the Impact of Model Compression Techniques on Fairness in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression language models*\n\n*Krithika Ramesh, Arnav Chavan, Shrey Pandit, Sunayana Sitaram*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification and indicates that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Abstract:** Compression techniques for deep learning have become increasingly popular, particularly in settings where latency and memory constraints are imposed. Several methods, such as pruning, distillation, and quantization, have been adopted for compressing models, each providing distinct advantages. However, existing literature demonstrates that compressing deep learning models could affect their fairness. Our analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which we benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification. We also investigate the impact of using multilingual models and evaluation measures. Our findings highlight the significance of considering both the pre-trained model and the chosen compression strategy in developing equitable language technologies. The results also indicate that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. The Cost of Compression: Investigating the Impact of Compression on Parametric Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression language models*\n\n*Satya Sai, Srinath Namburi, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Srinath Srinivasan, Frederic Sala*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive analysis across multiple model families using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance, with a particular focus on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing large language models (LLMs), often consisting of billions of parameters, provides faster inference, smaller memory footprints, and enables local deployment. Two standard compression techniques are pruning and quantization, with the former eliminating redundant connections in model layers and the latter representing model parameters with fewer bits. The key tradeoff is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER, ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical insights to help make informed decisions on compression.

History Compression via Language Models in Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression language models*\n\n*Fabian Paischer, Thomas Adler, Vihang Patil, Angela Bitto-Nemling, Markus Holzleitner, S. Lehner, Hamid Eghbalzadeh, Sepp Hochreiter*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency, and introduces FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** In a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), an agent typically uses a representation of the past to approximate the underlying MDP. We propose to utilize a frozen Pretrained Language Transformer (PLT) for history representation and compression to improve sample efficiency. To avoid training of the Transformer, we introduce FrozenHopfield, which automatically associates observations with pretrained token embeddings. To form these associations, a modern Hopfield network stores these token embeddings, which are retrieved by queries that are obtained by a random but fixed projection of observations. Our new method, HELM, enables actor-critic network architectures that contain a pretrained language Transformer for history representation as a memory module. Since a representation of the past need not be learned, HELM is much more sample efficient than competitors. On Minigrid and Procgen environments HELM achieves new state-of-the-art results.

DemaFormer: Damped Exponential Moving Average Transformer with Energy-Based Modeling for Temporal Language Grounding\n\n*From Search Query: moving average attention mechanisms*\n\n*Thong Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Cong-Duy Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment- query distributions is proposed and DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal Language Grounding seeks to localize video moments that semantically correspond to a natural language query. Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs. Comprehensive experiments on four public temporal language grounding datasets showcase the superiority of our methods over the state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Logical Languages Accepted by Transformer Encoders with Hard Attention\n\n*From Search Query: moving average attention mechanisms*\n\n*Pablo Barcel\u00f3, A. Kozachinskiy, A. W. Lin, Vladimir Podolskii*\n\n**TL;DR:** UHAT encoders can recognize a rich fragment of ${\\sf AC}^0$-languages, namely, all languages definable in first-order logic with arbitrary unary numerical predicates, and it is shown that AHAT encoder can recognize all languages of their logic even when the authors enrich it with counting terms.\n\n**Abstract:** We contribute to the study of formal languages that can be recognized by transformer encoders. We focus on two self-attention mechanisms: (1) UHAT (Unique Hard Attention Transformers) and (2) AHAT (Average Hard Attention Transformers). UHAT encoders are known to recognize only languages inside the circuit complexity class ${\\sf AC}^0$, i.e., accepted by a family of poly-sized and depth-bounded boolean circuits with unbounded fan-ins. On the other hand, AHAT encoders can recognize languages outside ${\\sf AC}^0$), but their expressive power still lies within the bigger circuit complexity class ${\\sf TC}^0$, i.e., ${\\sf AC}^0$-circuits extended by majority gates. We first show a negative result that there is an ${\\sf AC}^0$-language that cannot be recognized by an UHAT encoder. On the positive side, we show that UHAT encoders can recognize a rich fragment of ${\\sf AC}^0$-languages, namely, all languages definable in first-order logic with arbitrary unary numerical predicates. This logic, includes, for example, all regular languages from ${\\sf AC}^0$. We then show that AHAT encoders can recognize all languages of our logic even when we enrich it with counting terms. We apply these results to derive new results on the expressive power of UHAT and AHAT up to permutation of letters (a.k.a. Parikh images).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention patterns*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases.

Joty, Chen Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA) is proposed, which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Lifelong sequence generation (LSG), a problem in continual learning, aims to continually train a model on a sequence of generation tasks to learn constantly emerging new generation patterns while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Graph Neural Networks Under Spatio-Temporal Distribution Shift\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention patterns*\n\n*Zeyang Zhang, Xin Wang, Ziwei Zhang, Haoyang Li, Zhou Qin, Wenwu Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA), a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns, and proposes an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) have demonstrated powerful predictive abilities by exploiting graph structural and temporal dynamics. However, the existing DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in dynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant with respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns , i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts, which faces two key challenges: 1) How to discover the complex variant and invariant spatio-temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which involve both time-varying graph structures and node features. 2) How to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts with the discovered variant and invariant patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA ). Our proposed method can effectively handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and fully utilizing invariant spatio-temporal patterns. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. Then, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions by sampling and reassembling variant patterns across neighborhoods and time stamps to eliminate the spurious impacts of variant patterns. Lastly, we propose an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities and therefore handle distribution shifts. Experiments on three real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts. Our work is the first study of spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs, to the best of our knowledge\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression language models*\n\n*Hyun Oh Song, Sangdoo Yun, Junyoung Yeom, Jang-Hyun Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a context key/value compression method for Transformer language models in online scenarios, where the context continually expands. As the context lengthens, the attention process demands increasing memory and computations, which in turn reduces the throughput of the language model. To address this challenge, we propose a compressed context memory system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space, facilitating language model inference in a limited memory space of computing environments. Our compression process involves integrating a lightweight conditional LoRA into the language model's forward pass during inference, without the need for fine-tuning the model's entire set of weights. We achieve efficient training by modeling the recursive compression process as a single parallelized forward computation. Through evaluations on conversation, personalization, and multi-task learning, we demonstrate that our approach achieves the performance level of a full context model with $5\\times$ smaller context memory size. We further demonstrate the applicability of our approach in a streaming setting with an unlimited context length, outperforming the sliding window approach.

TT-Rec: Tensor Train Compression for Deep Learning Recommendation Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression language models*\n\n*Carole-Jean Wu, Xing Liu, Bilge Acun, Chunxing Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** The memory capacity of embedding tables in deep learning recommendation models (DLRMs) is increasing dramatically from tens of GBs to TBs across the industry. Given the fast growth in DLRMs, novel solutions are urgently needed, in order to enable fast and efficient DLRM innovations. At the same time, this must be done without having to exponentially increase infrastructure capacity demands. In this paper, we demonstrate the promising potential of Tensor Train decomposition for DLRMs (TT-Rec), an important yet under-investigated context. We design and implement optimized kernels (TT-EmbeddingBag) to evaluate the proposed TT-Rec design. TT-EmbeddingBag is 3 times faster than the SOTA TT implementation. The performance of TT-Rec is further optimized with the batched matrix multiplication and caching strategies for embedding vector lookup operations. In addition, we present mathematically and empirically the effect of weight initialization distribution on DLRM accuracy and propose to initialize the tensor cores of TT-Rec following the sampled Gaussian distribution. We evaluate TT-Rec across three important design space dimensions -- memory capacity, accuracy, and timing performance -- by training MLPerf-DLRM with Criteo's Kaggle and Terabyte data sets. TT-Rec achieves 117 times and 112 times model size compression, for Kaggle and Terabyte, respectively. This impressive model size reduction can come with no accuracy nor training time overhead as compared to the uncompressed baseline.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: moving average attention mechanisms*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of 1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67). Code: https://github.com/XuezheMax/megalodon\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-12\n\n\n\n#### 5. Discovering Dynamic Functional Brain Networks via Spatial and Channel-wise Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention patterns*\n\n*Bao Ge, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu, Xintao Hu, Shijie Zhao, Zhengliang Liu, Mengshen He, Enjie Ge, Yiheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Using deep learning models to recognize functional brain networks (FBNs) in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has been attracting increasing interest recently. However, most existing work focuses on detecting static FBNs from entire fMRI signals, such as correlation-based functional connectivity. Sliding-window is a widely used strategy to capture the dynamics of FBNs, but it is still limited in representing intrinsic functional interactive dynamics at each time step. And the number of FBNs usually need to be set manually. More over, due to the complexity of dynamic interactions in brain, traditional linear and shallow models are insufficient in identifying complex and spatially overlapped FBNs across each time step. In this paper, we propose a novel Spatial and Channel-wise Attention Autoencoder (SCAAE) for discovering FBNs dynamically. The core idea of SCAAE is to apply attention mechanism to FBNs construction. Specifically, we designed two attention modules: 1) spatial-wise attention (SA) module to discover FBNs in the spatial domain and 2) a channel-wise attention (CA) module to weigh the channels for selecting the FBNs automatically. We evaluated our approach on ADHD200 dataset and our results indicate that the proposed SCAAE method can effectively recover the dynamic changes of the FBNs at each fMRI time step, without using sliding windows. More importantly, our proposed hybrid attention modules (SA and CA) do not enforce assumptions of linearity and independence as previous methods, and thus provide a novel approach to better understanding dynamic functional brain networks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-19\n\n\n\n#### 6. Linear Transformers Are Secretly Fast Weight Programmers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic attention patterns*\n\n*J\u00fcrgen Schmidhuber, Kazuki Irie, Imanol Schlag*\n\n**Abstract:** We show the formal equivalence of linearised self-attention mechanisms and fast weight controllers from the early '90s, where a ``slow\" neural net learns by gradient descent to program the ``fast weights\" of another net through sequences of elementary programming instructions which are additive outer products of self-invented activation patterns (today called keys and values). Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n**Published:** 2021-02-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, focusing on memory compression, moving average attention mechanisms, dynamic attention patterns, and selective or prioritized state updates, here are some relevant findings and methods from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques\n\n- **PyramidInfer**: This method compresses the KV cache by layer-wise retaining crucial context, which significantly reduces GPU memory usage without sacrificing performance. It is particularly useful for high-throughput LLM inference, improving throughput by 2.2x and reducing GPU memory by over 54%.\n- **CASAK-V**: This approach implements adaptive KV-cache compression using a meta-learning framework. It dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns, reducing memory usage by 40% and achieving near-linear runtime complexity. This method is beneficial for memory-efficient long-context LLM inference.\n\n## Moving Average Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention**: This mechanism incorporates an exponential moving average to capture position-aware local dependencies within a position-agnostic attention mechanism. This can be valuable for efficient sequence processing by introducing inductive bias for local dependencies[Analysis Summary, Reference 2].\n\n## Dynamic or Adaptive Attention Patterns\n\n- **CASAK-V**: This method dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns using a meta-learning framework. It adjusts these patterns during token generation based on an attention map reconstruction heuristic, ensuring context-awareness and efficient long-context processing.\n- **PyramidInfer**: While not explicitly dynamic, PyramidInfer's layer-wise retention of crucial context can be seen as a form of adaptive attention, as it prioritizes the most influential keys and values at each layer.\n\n## Selective or Prioritized State Updates\n\n- **CASAK-V**: This approach implements adaptive chunk-wise KV-cache compression, which can be seen as a form of selective state update. It prioritizes the retention of crucial context based on attention scores, ensuring that only the most relevant information is retained.\n- **PyramidInfer**: By computing fewer keys and values based on the consistency in attention weights, PyramidInfer effectively prioritizes the most influential context, reducing memory consumption without sacrificing performance.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Prompt Compression**: While not directly related to the core mechanisms, prompt compression techniques can help reduce memory usage and inference costs by compressing long-form prompts. This can be integrated with other memory compression and attention optimization techniques to further enhance efficiency.\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Methods like Loki, which use low-rank keys for efficient sparse attention, can be combined with dynamic attention patterns and memory compression techniques to optimize both memory usage and computational efficiency[Analysis Summary, Reference 4].\n\nBy integrating these methods, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is more memory-efficient, computationally efficient, and adaptable to various input patterns, aligning with the goals of improving memory management, computational efficiency, and adaptability.\n",

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/39 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/48 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nJayakumar, Chloe Hillier, and Timothy P.

IA-RED2: Interpretability-Aware Redundancy Reduction for Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformers*\n\n*Bowen Pan, Yifan Jiang, Rameswar Panda, Zhangyang Wang, R. Feris, A. Oliva*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the interpretability that naturally emerged in the I-RED framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention-based model, transformer, is recently becoming the leading backbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success made by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy computation and intensive memory costs. To address this limitation, this paper presents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$). We start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on uncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to dynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework is then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at different stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage of computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video tasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4x speed-up for state-of-the-art models like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy. More importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is inherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision transformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being lighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Grokking of Hierarchical Structure in Vanilla Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformers*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated.\n\n**Abstract:** For humans, language production and comprehension is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of sentences. In natural language processing, past work has questioned how effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated. We call this phenomenon structural grokking. On multiple datasets, structural grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth: intermediate-depth models generalize better than both very deep and very shallow transformers. When analyzing the relationship between model-internal properties and grokking, we find that optimal depth for grokking can be identified using the tree-structuredness metric of CITATION. Overall, our work provides strong evidence that, with extended training, vanilla transformers discover and use hierarchical structure.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Tuning LayerNorm in Attention: Towards Efficient Multi-Modal LLM Finetuning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average attention*\n\n*Bingchen Zhao, Haoqin Tu, Chen Wei, Jieru Mei, Cihang Xie*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces an efficient strategy to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) by conceptualizing this transformation as a domain adaptation process, i.e., transitioning from text understanding to embracing multiple modalities, and demonstrates that selectively tuning only with conversational data can improve efficiency further.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces an efficient strategy to transform Large Language Models (LLMs) into Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs). By conceptualizing this transformation as a domain adaptation process, i.e., transitioning from text understanding to embracing multiple modalities, we intriguingly note that, within each attention block, tuning LayerNorm suffices to yield strong performance. Moreover, when benchmarked against other tuning approaches like full parameter finetuning or LoRA, its benefits on efficiency are substantial. For example, when compared to LoRA on a 13B model scale, performance can be enhanced by an average of over 20% across five multi-modal tasks, and meanwhile, results in a significant reduction of trainable parameters by 41.9% and a decrease in GPU memory usage by 17.6%. On top of this LayerNorm strategy, we showcase that selectively tuning only with conversational data can improve efficiency further. Beyond these empirical outcomes, we provide a comprehensive analysis to explore the role of LayerNorm in adapting LLMs to the multi-modal domain and improving the expressive power of the model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. DemaFormer: Damped Exponential Moving Average Transformer with Energy-Based Modeling for Temporal Language Grounding\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average attention*\n\n*Thong Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Cong-Duy Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment- query distributions is proposed and DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal Language Grounding seeks to localize video moments that semantically correspond to a natural language query. Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs. Comprehensive experiments on four public temporal language grounding datasets showcase the superiority of our methods over the state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. DoRA: Enhancing Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Dynamic Rank Distribution\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Yulong Mao, Kaiyu Huang, Changhao Guan, Ganglin Bao, Fengran Mo, Jinan Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large-scale pre-trained models is inherently a resource-intensive task. While it can enhance the capabilities of the model, it also incurs substantial computational costs, posing challenges to the practical application of downstream tasks. Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) rely on a bypass framework that ignores the differential parameter budget requirements across weight matrices, which may lead to suboptimal fine-tuning outcomes. To address this issue, we introduce the Dynamic Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) method. DoRA decomposes high-rank LoRA layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training, which makes the most of the limited parameter budget. Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA can achieve competitive performance compared with LoRA and full model fine-tuning, and outperform various strong baselines with the same storage parameter budget.

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8.

Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning (PETL) has the potential to address this problem due to its robustness. However, it has yet to be applied to the zero-shot scenarios, as it is not clear how to apply it unsupervisedly. Our method, Prompter, uses descriptions of target domain slots to generate dynamic prefixes that are concatenated to the key and values at each layer\u2019s self-attention mechanism. This allows for the use of prefix-tuning in zero-shot. Prompter outperforms previous methods on both the MultiWOZ and SGD benchmarks. In generating prefixes, our analyses find that Prompter not only utilizes the semantics of slot descriptions but also how often the slots appear together in conversation. Moreover, Prompter\u2019s gains are due to its improved ability to distinguish \u201dnone\u201d-valued dialogue slots, compared against baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformers*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

SPARTAN: Sparse Hierarchical Memory for Parameter-Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory transformers*\n\n*Avirup Sil, Karthik Narasimhan, Ashwin Kalyan, Anthony Ferritto, Md Arafat Sultan, Ameet Deshpande*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieves impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks, and their sizes have consequently been getting bigger. Since a different copy of the model is required for each task, this paradigm is infeasible for storage-constrained edge devices like mobile phones. In this paper, we propose SPARTAN, a parameter efficient (PE) and computationally fast architecture for edge devices that adds hierarchically organized sparse memory after each Transformer layer. SPARTAN freezes the PLM parameters and fine-tunes only its memory, thus significantly reducing storage costs by re-using the PLM backbone for different tasks. SPARTAN contains two levels of memory, with only a sparse subset of parents being chosen in the first level for each input, and children cells corresponding to those parents being used to compute an output representation. This sparsity combined with other architecture optimizations improves SPARTAN's throughput by over 90% during inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 when compared to PE baselines (adapters) while also outperforming the latter by 0.1 points on the GLUE benchmark. Further, it can be trained 34% faster in a few-shot setting, while performing within 0.9 points of adapters. Qualitative analysis shows that different parent cells in SPARTAN specialize in different topics, thus dividing responsibility efficiently.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-29\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average attention*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence modeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of Mega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces multiple technical components to improve its capability and stability, including complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization layer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual configuration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon achieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion parameters and 2 trillion training tokens.

DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Adapter Meets Prompt Tuning: Parameter-Efficient Transfer Learning for Point Cloud Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic parameter adaptation*\n\n*Xiang Bai, Zhikang Zou, Yihan Xu, Xingkui Zhu, Wei Xu, Dingkang Liang, Xin Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Point cloud analysis has achieved outstanding performance by transferring point cloud pre-trained models. However, existing methods for model adaptation usually update all model parameters, i.e., full fine-tuning paradigm, which is inefficient as it relies on high computational costs (e.g., training GPU memory) and massive storage space. In this paper, we aim to study parameter-efficient transfer learning for point cloud analysis with an ideal trade-off between task performance and parameter efficiency. To achieve this goal, we freeze the parameters of the default pre-trained models and then propose the Dynamic Adapter, which generates a dynamic scale for each token, considering the token significance to the downstream task. We further seamlessly integrate Dynamic Adapter with Prompt Tuning (DAPT) by constructing Internal Prompts, capturing the instance-specific features for interaction. Extensive experiments conducted on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed DAPT achieves superior performance compared to the full fine-tuning counterparts while significantly reducing the trainable parameters and training GPU memory by 95% and 35%, respectively.

It organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content, corresponding semantic embeddings, and varying abstraction levels. This approach enhances performance in scenarios demanding structured memory management, such as multi-turn dialogue understanding and document question answering.\n\n2. **Hybrid Multimodal Memory**:\n   The Hybrid Multimodal Memory module, consisting of Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph (HDKG) and Abstracted Multimodal Experience Pool (AMEP), is used in the Optimus-1 agent. HDKG transforms knowledge into high-level semantic representations, and AMEP summarizes historical information to provide rich references for in-context learning. This hierarchical memory structure significantly improves the agent's performance on long-horizon tasks.\n\n### Efficient Implementations of Moving Average in Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention (Mega)**:\n   The Mega mechanism introduces a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention equipped with an exponential moving average. This incorporates the inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism, which can be efficient for temporal processing[Key References and Excerpts].\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Adaptation Techniques\n\n1. **Dynamic Compression and Selective State Updates**:\n   The \"Compressed Context Memory For Online Language Model Interaction\" proposes a system that continually compresses the accumulating attention key/value pairs into a compact memory space. This involves dynamic compression based on content importance and selective state updates, which can be seen as a form of dynamic parameter adaptation[Key References and Excerpts].\n\n2. **Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation**:\n   The work on \"Lifelong Sequence Generation with Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation\" discusses techniques for dynamically adapting model parameters and expanding modules based on the task requirements. This approach allows for flexible and efficient adaptation during test-time training (though not directly mentioned, it aligns with the concept of dynamic adaptation).\n\n### Methods for Combining Sparse Attention with Online Learning\n\n1. **Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention**:\n   This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 2. Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.59)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/29 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nJack W.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hierarchical memory implementation transformers, moving average attention integration, memory compression techniques\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory implementation transformers*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 2. Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory implementation transformers*\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory implementation transformers*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 5.

Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs.

In this paper, we propose using kernel exponential families [4] and our new sparse counterpart, kernel deformed exponential families. Theoretically, we show new existence results for both families, and approximation capabilities for the deformed case.

A Comparative Study on the Impact of Model Compression Techniques on Fairness in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression techniques*\n\n*Krithika Ramesh, Arnav Chavan, Shrey Pandit, Sunayana Sitaram*\n\n**TL;DR:** This analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification and indicates that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Abstract:** Compression techniques for deep learning have become increasingly popular, particularly in settings where latency and memory constraints are imposed. Several methods, such as pruning, distillation, and quantization, have been adopted for compressing models, each providing distinct advantages. However, existing literature demonstrates that compressing deep learning models could affect their fairness. Our analysis involves a comprehensive evaluation of pruned, distilled, and quantized language models, which we benchmark across a range of intrinsic and extrinsic metrics for measuring bias in text classification. We also investigate the impact of using multilingual models and evaluation measures. Our findings highlight the significance of considering both the pre-trained model and the chosen compression strategy in developing equitable language technologies. The results also indicate that compression strategies can have an adverse effect on fairness measures.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. The Cost of Compression: Investigating the Impact of Compression on Parametric Knowledge in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression techniques*\n\n*Satya Sai, Srinath Namburi, Makesh Narsimhan Sreedhar, Srinath Srinivasan, Frederic Sala*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive analysis across multiple model families using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance, with a particular focus on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing large language models (LLMs), often consisting of billions of parameters, provides faster inference, smaller memory footprints, and enables local deployment. Two standard compression techniques are pruning and quantization, with the former eliminating redundant connections in model layers and the latter representing model parameters with fewer bits. The key tradeoff is between the degree of compression and the impact on the quality of the compressed model. Existing research on LLM compression primarily focuses on performance in terms of general metrics like perplexity or downstream task accuracy. More fine-grained metrics, such as those measuring parametric knowledge, remain significantly underexplored. To help bridge this gap, we present a comprehensive analysis across multiple model families (ENCODER, ENCODER-DECODER, and DECODER) using the LAMA and LM-HARNESS benchmarks in order to systematically quantify the effect of commonly employed compression techniques on model performance. A particular focus is on tradeoffs involving parametric knowledge, with the goal of providing practitioners with practical insights to help make informed decisions on compression.

Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression techniques*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory implementation transformers*\n\n*Felix Hill, Andrea Banino, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrew Kyle Lampinen*\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore \"mentally time-travel\" -- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory implementation transformers*\n\n*Jason Cong, Yizhou Sun, Neha Prakriya, Zongyue Qin, Zifan He*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in language processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context window that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous works in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context and maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures, which have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are good at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory hierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models' long-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior. Leveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory hierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. Evaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and question-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the long-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models. With an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment future LLMs to handle long context effectively.

Bitcoin Price Prediction: An ARIMA Approach\n\n*From Search Query: moving average attention integration*\n\n*Amin Azari*\n\n**Abstract:** Bitcoin is considered the most valuable currency in the world. Besides being highly valuable, its value has also experienced a steep increase, from around 1 dollar in 2010 to around 18000 in 2017. Then, in recent years, it has attracted considerable attention in a diverse set of fields, including economics and computer science. The former mainly focuses on studying how it affects the market, determining reasons behinds its price fluctuations, and predicting its future prices. The latter mainly focuses on its vulnerabilities, scalability, and other techno-crypto-economic issues. Here, we aim at revealing the usefulness of traditional autoregressive integrative moving average (ARIMA) model in predicting the future value of bitcoin by analyzing the price time series in a 3-years-long time period. On the one hand, our empirical studies reveal that this simple scheme is efficient in sub-periods in which the behavior of the time-series is almost unchanged, especially when it is used for short-term prediction, e.g. 1-day. On the other hand, when we try to train the ARIMA model to a 3-years-long period, during which the bitcoin price has experienced different behaviors, or when we try to use it for a long-term prediction, we observe that it introduces large prediction errors. Especially, the ARIMA model is unable to capture the sharp fluctuations in the price, e.g. the volatility at the end of 2017. Then, it calls for more features to be extracted and used along with the price for a more accurate prediction of the price. We have further investigated the bitcoin price prediction using an ARIMA model, trained over a large dataset, and a limited test window of the bitcoin price, with length $w$, as inputs. Our study sheds lights on the interaction of the prediction accuracy, choice of ($p,q,d$), and window size $w$.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Predicting the Number of Reported Bugs in a Software Repository\n\n*From Search Query: moving average attention integration*\n\n*Ay\u015fe Ba\u015far, Mucahit Cevik, Hadi Jahanshahi*\n\n**Abstract:** The bug growth pattern prediction is a complicated, unrelieved task, which needs considerable attention. Advance knowledge of the likely number of bugs discovered in the software system helps software developers in designating sufficient resources at a convenient time. The developers may also use such information to take necessary actions to increase the quality of the system and in turn customer satisfaction. In this study, we examine eight different time series forecasting models, including Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks (LSTM), auto-regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), and Random Forest Regressor. Further, we assess the impact of exogenous variables such as software release dates by incorporating those into the prediction models. We analyze the quality of long-term prediction for each model based on different performance metrics. The assessment is conducted on Mozilla, which is a large open-source software application. The dataset is originally mined from Bugzilla and contains the number of bugs for the project between Jan 2010 and Dec 2019. Our numerical analysis provides insights on evaluating the trends in a bug repository. We observe that LSTM is effective when considering long-run predictions whereas Random Forest Regressor enriched by exogenous variables performs better for predicting the number of bugs in the short term.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-24\n\n\n\n#### 5.

SqueezeNet: AlexNet-level accuracy with 50x fewer parameters and <0.5MB model size\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression techniques*\n\n*Song Han, Forrest N. Iandola, Matthew W. Moskewicz, Khalid Ashraf, William J. Dally, Kurt Keutzer*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research on deep neural networks has focused primarily on improving\naccuracy. For a given accuracy level, it is typically possible to identify\nmultiple DNN architectures that achieve that accuracy level. With equivalent\naccuracy, smaller DNN architectures offer at least three advantages: (1)\nSmaller DNNs require less communication across servers during distributed\ntraining. (2) Smaller DNNs require less bandwidth to export a new model from\nthe cloud to an autonomous car. (3) Smaller DNNs are more feasible to deploy on\nFPGAs and other hardware with limited memory. To provide all of these\nadvantages, we propose a small DNN architecture called SqueezeNet. SqueezeNet\nachieves AlexNet-level accuracy on ImageNet with 50x fewer parameters.\nAdditionally, with model compression techniques we are able to compress\nSqueezeNet to less than 0.5MB (510x smaller than AlexNet).\n  The SqueezeNet architecture is available for download here:\nhttps://github.com/DeepScale/SqueezeNet\n\n**Published:** 2016-02-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical memory implementation, integrating moving average attention, and memory compression strategies, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Hierarchical Memory Implementation in Transformers\n\n### Tree-Structured Memory\nThe \"Dynamic Tree Memory Representation for LLMs\" (MemTree) approach is particularly relevant. MemTree organizes memory hierarchically, with each node encapsulating aggregated textual content and corresponding semantic embeddings. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient and adaptive representation of the evolving conversation, maintaining a balance between abstract representations at higher levels and specific details at lower levels.\n\n### Multi-Level Organization\nThe concept of hierarchical memory can also be seen in the \"Hierarchical Memory Transformer\" (HMT) and \"SPARTAN: Sparse Hierarchical Memory\" models. HMT preserves tokens from early input token segments and recalls relevant information from history, while SPARTAN uses a sparse subset of parents and children cells to compute output representations. These models demonstrate how to implement multi-level memory hierarchies efficiently[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Integrating Moving Average with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\nThe \"Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\" mechanism introduces a simple and theoretically grounded single-head gated attention mechanism that incorporates moving averages. This approach adds an inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism, enhancing the model's ability to capture local and global dependencies[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Memory Compression and Management Strategies\n\n### Dynamic Compression Techniques\nMemTree employs dynamic compression techniques by aggregating content and updating embeddings in a hierarchical manner. This approach ensures that new information is efficiently integrated into the existing memory hierarchy while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nTechniques like sparse attention mechanisms, where the model only attends to a subset of the input at each layer, can significantly reduce computational requirements and memory usage. This is highlighted in the discussion on scaling up transformer models, where sparse attention is mentioned as a method to handle longer sequences more efficiently.\n\n### Model Pruning and Knowledge Distillation\nTo manage memory and reduce computational requirements, model pruning and knowledge distillation can be employed. Model pruning involves removing less important connections or neurons, while knowledge distillation involves training smaller models to mimic the behavior of larger models, effectively compressing the knowledge into a more efficient form.\n\n### Dynamic Rank Distribution\nThe \"DoRA: Dynamic Rank Distribution\" approach decomposes high-rank layers into structured single-rank components, allowing for dynamic pruning of the parameter budget based on their importance to specific tasks during training. This method can help in managing memory and computational resources efficiently[Analysis Summary].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nEfficient attention mechanisms such as linear attention or multi-query attention can scale better with sequence length, reducing the computational complexity associated with traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n### Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph\nWhile not directly related to language models, the \"Hybrid Multimodal Memory\" module's use of Hierarchical Directed Knowledge Graph (HDKG) and Abstracted Multimodal Experience Pool (AMEP) provides insights into how hierarchical knowledge representation can be effectively managed and utilized, which could be adapted for language models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models with improved memory management and attention mechanisms.\n",

Memformer: A Memory-Augmented Transformer for Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Qingyang Wu, Zhenzhong Lan, Kun Qian, Jing Gu, A. Geramifard, Zhou Yu*\n\n**Published in:** AACL/IJCNLP (2020)\t**Cited by** 36  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information, and proposes a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back- Propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have reached remarkable success in sequence modeling. However, these models have efficiency issues as they need to store all the history token-level representations as memory. We present Memformer, an efficient neural network for sequence modeling, that utilizes an external dynamic memory to encode and retrieve past information. Our model achieves linear time complexity and constant memory space complexity when processing long sequences. We also propose a new optimization scheme, memory replay back-propagation (MRBP), which promotes long-range back-propagation through time with a significantly reduced memory requirement. Experimental results show that Memformer has achieved comparable performance compared to the baselines by using 8.1x less memory space and 3.2x faster on inference. Analysis of the attention pattern shows that our external memory slots can encode and retain important information through timesteps.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nTransformers have achieved great success in various natural language processing tasks. Nevertheless, the quadratic computation complexity can be costly. Some works try to address the limitations of selfattention, including Reformer, Sparse Transformer, Longformer, Linformer (Child et al., 2019; Kitaev et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020), etc. They successfully reduce the complexity of self-attention and thus enable processing longer sequences. However, most of them still require linear memory space complexity. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) re-introduces the concept of memory and recurrence. It caches each layer's hidden states of self-attention into a fixed-size queue and re-uses them in the later attention computation. However, the memory as raw hidden states cannot effectively compress highlevel information. Thus, Transformer-XL in practice needs a massive memory size to perform well, and spends huge computation in using its memory. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) improves upon Transformer-XL by further compressing its memories into fewer vectors via a compression network. However, as mentioned in the papers, both Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer discard the information from the distant past, which causes a theoretical maximum tempo-\nral range given the fixed memory size. Inspired by the previous external memory networks, we propose Memformer, which incorporates a fixed-size external dynamic memory combined with the recent Transformer architecture. Memformer interacts with its external dynamic memory through the memory reading and writing modules. Also, we introduce a forgetting mechanism to improve the effectiveness of memorizing new information. By utilizing recurrence and a fixedsize memory, our model has a theoretically infinite temporal range of memorization and implies a linear computation complexity and constant memory space complexity. As the traditional backpropagation through time (BPTT) has an unaffordable memory cost in our model, we introduce a new optimization scheme, memory replay backpropagation (MRBP), to significantly reduce the memory cost in training recurrent neural networks with large size of memory representations. We evaluate Memformer on the autoregressive image generation and language modeling task. Experimental results show that Memformer performs on par with Transformer and Transformer XL with large memory size, while being much more efficient in terms of computation speed and memory space consumption. We also conduct an analysis showing that Memformer can retain information for an extended period. ## 2 Related Work\n\nThis section introduces some recent research directions that aim to alleviate the quadratic cost of selfattention. Moreover, we analyze their assumptions and limitations under the autoregressive setting to provide a broader view of these models. ### 2.1 Sparse Attention\n\nOne influential direction is to replace the full selfattention with sparse attention patterns to speed up the computation. Child et al. (2019) proposed Sparse Transformer, using a block sparse attention pattern to reduce the computation complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$. Later, Longformer (Beltagy et al., 2020) and Big Bird (Zaheer et al., 2020) further explored this direction and proposed an even more sparse attention pattern to reduce the cost to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$. They introduced global tokens to encode the information from the entire sequence and kept the selfattention to the closest $k$ tokens and the global tokens to achieve linear complexity. Although linear sparse attention's theoretical soundness is proven for bidirectional encoders, it does not hold for the decoder. The main reason is that the global tokens cannot leak information to the future tokens in the autoregressive setting, where all the tokens can only see their previous tokens. Thus, linear sparse attention cannot guarantee a token to see its all past tokens. Only Sparse Transformer here with $\\mathcal{O}(N \\sqrt{N})$ complexity can theoretically cover all the past tokens for the sequence generation. ### 2.2 Linear Attention\n\nAnother direction is focusing on improving the softmax operation in the self-attention. Linformer (Wang et al., 2020) reduced the complexity to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ by projecting the entire sequence to a constant size of keys and values, but this method has not been applied to autoregressive decoding. Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) used a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps to replace softmax. However, for Linear Transformer under the autoregressive setting, it needs to compute the cumulative summation to aggregate the history information. This assumption is too strong if the input sequence is long and the length is not fixed. After thousands of steps, the numerical values can become very large due to the summation, causing overflow and gradient instability. ### 2.3 Recurrence and Memory\n\nApplying recurrence and memory to Transformers is an orthogonal direction comparing to the efficient attention approaches. If the memory size is constant, recurrence enables the model to have constant memory complexity during inference. There are mainly two works exploring this direction. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) used relative positional encoding and consisted of a segmentlevel recurrence mechanism to encode beyond a fixed-length context. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) extended from Transformer-XL by further compressing the previous cached hidden states to achieve a longer context. However, using past hidden states as memory would cause a theoretical maximum temporal range of context, meaning that a token is not guaranteed to see all the past tokens. Thus, in practice, Transformer-XL and Compressive Transformer need huge memory size to achieve good performance. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_a5b0bfb29582fd0f4766g-03.jpg?height=915&width=717&top_left_y=225&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: Memformer overall architecture for the encoder (left) and decoder (right). Transformer encoder is responsible to interact with the memory. Sequence modeling is achieved by predicting the next segment conditioned to the current segment and memory. ### 2.3.1 Dynamic Memorization\n\nWithin the scope of memory networks, there are dynamic memorization techniques. Different from Transformer-XL which stores the token-level history representations as memory, dynamic memorization does not have a theoretical upper bound for the temporal range. Neural Turing Machine (NTM) (Graves et al., 2014) and Differential Neural Computer (DNC) (Graves et al., 2016) are two early models that can control external memory resources to achieve long-lasting memory.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token.

Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models.

This scalability fuels a trend analogous to Moore's law, which links increased model size to performance gains [39]. The effectiveness of attention in text sequence processing was solidified through the Transformer paper. Models like BERT [16] and GPT-3 [33] further showcased the scalability of Transformer and its tendency for improved performance with increased model size. Following the replacement of LSTM [5] by Transformer in most Natural Language Processing (NLP) domains, the Vision Transformer (ViT) [32] replaced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) [4] with Transformers in the vision domain, and Conformer (Convolution-augmented Transformer) [29] replaced LSTM in the speech domain. The Transformer has become the de facto architecture in various domains. Currently, attention serves as the leading architecture for extracting meaningful representations from homogeneous data. The logical progression points toward extending attention capabilities to heterogeneous data. This has enabled advances in multimodal fusion (text and vision), as seen in models like DALL$\\cdot$E 2 [55], Flamingo [54] and CoCa [53]. AudioLM [64] has shown that attention also excels at fusing audio and text. Consequently, Gemini [69] integrates text, images, audio, and video into a single generative model. This was possible because attention to heterogeneous data works exceptionally well. Despite the impressive success of attention, it suffers from major drawbacks. Firstly, attention has quadratic complexity with respect to context length, which limits the capability of modeling long contexts. Secondly, it forgets information from context before attention window, unlike LSTM, which theoretically can propagate information indefinitely. We want the better architecture to be able to process arbitrarily long sequences efficiently, while preserving very long-term dependencies. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_364db6cf7554a04db2efg-02.jpg?height=407&width=1404&top_left_y=232&top_left_x=361)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of query-key attention masks for Sliding Window Attention (SWA) variants.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 5. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 13 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: efficient moving average implementation, memory compression performance, hierarchical memory TTT\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 2. Bidirectional Looking with A Novel Double Exponential Moving Average to Adaptive and Non-adaptive Momentum Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average implementation*\n\n*Yineng Chen, Z. Li, Lefei Zhang, Bo Du, Hai Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper innovatively combine the backward-looking and forward-looking aspects of the optimizer algorithm and proposes a novel Admeta optimizer framework, which outperforms the authors' base optimizers and shows advantages over recently proposed competitive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizer is an essential component for the success of deep learning, which guides the neural network to update the parameters according to the loss on the training set. SGD and Adam are two classical and effective optimizers on which researchers have proposed many variants, such as SGDM and RAdam. In this paper, we innovatively combine the backward-looking and forward-looking aspects of the optimizer algorithm and propose a novel \\textsc{Admeta} (\\textbf{A} \\textbf{D}ouble exponential \\textbf{M}oving averag\\textbf{E} \\textbf{T}o \\textbf{A}daptive and non-adaptive momentum) optimizer framework. For backward-looking part, we propose a DEMA variant scheme, which is motivated by a metric in the stock market, to replace the common exponential moving average scheme. While in the forward-looking part, we present a dynamic lookahead strategy which asymptotically approaches a set value, maintaining its speed at early stage and high convergence performance at final stage. Based on this idea, we provide two optimizer implementations, \\textsc{AdmetaR} and \\textsc{AdmetaS}, the former based on RAdam and the latter based on SGDM. Through extensive experiments on diverse tasks, we find that the proposed \\textsc{Admeta} optimizer outperforms our base optimizers and shows advantages over recently proposed competitive optimizers. We also provide theoretical proof of these two algorithms, which verifies the convergence of our proposed \\textsc{Admeta}.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Online Clustering with Moving Costs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average implementation*\n\n*Dimitrios Christou, Stratis Skoulakis, V. Cevher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents the first O (log n ) -regret polynomial-time online learning algorithm guaranteeing that the overall cost (connection + moving) is at most O (log n ) times the time-averaged connection cost of the best fixed solution.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work we consider an online learning problem, called Online k -Clustering with Moving Costs , at which a learner maintains a set of k facilities over T rounds so as to minimize the connection cost of an adversarially selected sequence of clients. The learner is informed on the positions of the clients at each round t only after its facility-selection and can use this information to update its decision in the next round. However, updating the facility positions comes with an additional moving cost based on the moving distance of the facilities. We present the first O (log n ) -regret polynomial-time online learning algorithm guaranteeing that the overall cost (connection + moving) is at most O (log n ) times the time-averaged connection cost of the best fixed solution . Our work improves on the recent result of Fotakis et al.

Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression performance*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Memory Replay with Data Compression for Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression performance*\n\n*Liyuan Wang, Xingxing Zhang, Kuo Yang, L. Yu, Chongxuan Li, Lanqing Hong, Shifeng Zhang, Zhenguo Li, Yi Zhong, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality for currently-arrived training samples to reduce the storage cost of old training samples and thus increase their amount that can be stored in the memory buffer.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning needs to overcome catastrophic forgetting of the past. Memory replay of representative old training samples has been shown as an effective solution, and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, existing work is mainly built on a small memory buffer containing a few original data, which cannot fully characterize the old data distribution. In this work, we propose memory replay with data compression (MRDC) to reduce the storage cost of old training samples and thus increase their amount that can be stored in the memory buffer. Observing that the trade-off between the quality and quantity of compressed data is highly nontrivial for the efficacy of memory replay, we propose a novel method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality for currently-arrived training samples. In this way, using a naive data compression algorithm with a properly selected quality can largely boost recent strong baselines by saving more compressed data in a limited storage space. We extensively validate this across several benchmarks of class-incremental learning and in a realistic scenario of object detection for autonomous driving.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6.

Memory-based methods like LUMEN (de Jong et al., 2023a) pre-compute token representations for retrieved passages to drastically speed up inference. However, memory also leads to much greater storage requirements from storing pre-computed representations. We propose MEMORY-VQ, a new method to reduce storage requirements of memory-augmented models without sacrificing performance. Our method uses a vector quantization variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to compress token representations. We apply MEMORY-VQ to the LUMEN model to obtain LUMEN-VQ, a memory model that achieves a 16x compression rate with comparable performance on the KILT benchmark.

Towards mental time travel: a hierarchical memory for reinforcement learning agents\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory TTT*\n\n*Andrew Kyle Lampinen, Stephanie C. Y. Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 8. Hierarchical Variational Memory for Few-shot Learning Across Domains\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical memory TTT*\n\n*Yingjun Du, Xiantong Zhen, Ling Shao, Cees G. M. Snoek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory, endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural memory enables fast adaptation to new tasks with just a few training samples. Existing memory models store features only from the single last layer, which does not generalize well in presence of a domain shift between training and test distributions. Rather than relying on a flat memory, we propose a hierarchical alternative that stores features at different semantic levels. We introduce a hierarchical prototype model, where each level of the prototype fetches corresponding information from the hierarchical memory. The model is endowed with the ability to flexibly rely on features at different semantic levels if the domain shift circumstances so demand. We meta-learn the model by a newly derived hierarchical variational inference framework, where hierarchical memory and prototypes are jointly optimized. To explore and exploit the importance of different semantic levels, we further propose to learn the weights associated with the prototype at each level in a data-driven way, which enables the model to adaptively choose the most generalizable features. We conduct thorough ablation studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of each component in our model. The new state-of-the-art performance on cross-domain and competitive performance on traditional few-shot classification further substantiates the benefit of hierarchical variational memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

However, their success is not well-understood theoretically. We provide theoretical insight into this success, proving in a finite-precision setting that RNNs can efficiently generate bounded hierarchical languages that reflect the scaffolding of natural language syntax. We introduce Dyck-($k$,$m$), the language of well-nested brackets (of $k$ types) and $m$-bounded nesting depth, reflecting the bounded memory needs and long-distance dependencies of natural language syntax. The best known results use $O(k^{\\frac{m}{2}})$ memory (hidden units) to generate these languages. We prove that an RNN with $O(m \\log k)$ hidden units suffices, an exponential reduction in memory, by an explicit construction. Finally, we show that no algorithm, even with unbounded computation, can suffice with $o(m \\log k)$ hidden units.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Graph Neural Networks with convolutional ARMA filters\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average implementation*\n\n*Filippo Maria Bianchi, Lorenzo Livi, Daniele Grattarola, Cesare Alippi*\n\n**Abstract:** Popular graph neural networks implement convolution operations on graphs based on polynomial spectral filters. In this paper, we propose a novel graph convolutional layer inspired by the auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) filter that, compared to polynomial ones, provides a more flexible frequency response, is more robust to noise, and better captures the global graph structure. We propose a graph neural network implementation of the ARMA filter with a recursive and distributed formulation, obtaining a convolutional layer that is efficient to train, localized in the node space, and can be transferred to new graphs at test time. We perform a spectral analysis to study the filtering effect of the proposed ARMA layer and report experiments on four downstream tasks: semi-supervised node classification, graph signal classification, graph classification, and graph regression. Results show that the proposed ARMA layer brings significant improvements over graph neural networks based on polynomial filters.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. ExtEnD: Extractive Entity Disambiguation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient moving average implementation*\n\n*Roberto Navigli, Luigi Procopio, Edoardo Barba*\n\n**Abstract:** Local models for Entity Disambiguation (ED) have today become extremely powerful, in most part thanks to the advent of large pre-trained language models. However, despite their significant performance achievements, most of these approaches frame ED through classification formulations that have intrinsic limitations, both computationally and from a modeling perspective. In contrast with this trend, here we propose ExtEnD, a novel local formulation for ED where we frame this task as a text extraction problem, and present two Transformer-based architectures that implement it. Based on experiments in and out of domain, and training over two different data regimes, we find our approach surpasses all its competitors in terms of both data efficiency and raw performance. ExtEnD outperforms its alternatives by as few as 6 F1 points on the more constrained of the two data regimes and, when moving to the other higher-resourced regime, sets a new state of the art on 4 out of 4 benchmarks under consideration, with average improvements of 0.7 F1 points overall and 1.1 F1 points out of domain. In addition, to gain better insights from our results, we also perform a fine-grained evaluation of our performances on different classes of label frequency, along with an ablation study of our architectural choices and an error analysis.

Kurkoski, Shunqi Huang, Lei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being used in large-scale systems. To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results' validity and accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. On Orthogonal Approximate Message Passing\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression performance*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Approximate Message Passing (AMP) is an efficient iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions, such as sparse systems. In AMP, a so-called Onsager term is added to keep estimation errors approximately Gaussian. Orthogonal AMP (OAMP) does not require this Onsager term, relying instead on an orthogonalization procedure to keep the current errors uncorrelated with (i.e., orthogonal to) past errors. \\LL{In this paper, we show the generality and significance of the orthogonality in ensuring that errors are \"asymptotically independently and identically distributed Gaussian\" (AIIDG).} This AIIDG property, which is essential for the attractive performance of OAMP, holds for separable functions. \\LL{We present a simple and versatile procedure to establish the orthogonality through Gram-Schmidt (GS) orthogonalization, which is applicable to any prototype. We show that different AMP-type algorithms, such as expectation propagation (EP), turbo, AMP and OAMP, can be unified under the orthogonal principle.} The simplicity and generality of OAMP provide efficient solutions for estimation problems beyond the classical linear models. \\LL{As an example, we study the optimization of OAMP via the GS model and GS orthogonalization.} More related applications will be discussed in a companion paper where new algorithms are developed for problems with multiple constraints and multiple measurement variables.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on efficient moving average implementation, memory compression performance, and integration of hierarchical memory in Transformer-Tensor-Transformer (TTT) architectures, here are some specific details and techniques that can be considered:\n\n### Implementation Techniques for Moving Average Attention in Transformers\n\n1. **Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention**\n   - This approach introduces a gated attention mechanism that incorporates an exponential moving average to capture position-aware local dependencies. The moving average helps in smoothing the attention weights over time, which can be particularly useful for tasks requiring long-term dependencies. The Mega mechanism is theoretically grounded and has shown to be effective in capturing inductive biases of local dependencies[3,.\n\n2. **Autoregressive Moving-average Attention Mechanism**\n   - This mechanism adapts various linear attention mechanisms by integrating an autoregressive moving-average structure. This allows the model to capture both long-range and local temporal patterns in time series data, which can be extended to other sequential data types. The use of moving averages helps in stabilizing the attention weights and improving the model's ability to predict future values.\n\n### Performance Impact of Different Memory Compression Methods\n\n1. **LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention**\n   - LoMA introduces a method for lossless compression of the KV cache in transformers. This approach compresses the KV cache after every \\(tc\\) generated tokens with a specified compression ratio and target compressed length. This technique reduces memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation without compromising the model's performance.\n\n2. **Low-Rank Approximations**\n   - Using low-rank approximations for key vectors can significantly reduce the memory footprint of the model. This method involves approximating the key vectors using lower-dimensional representations, which can be done using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or other matrix factorization methods. This approach maintains the model's performance while reducing the memory requirements[3,.\n\n3. **Dynamic Context Pruning**\n   - Dynamic context pruning involves selectively pruning the contextual information based on its relevance to the current prediction task. This method can reduce the memory usage and computational cost by eliminating less relevant context, thereby improving the model's efficiency during inference.\n\n### Integration Approaches for Hierarchical Memory in TTT Architectures\n\n1. **Hierarchical Memory Transformer (HMT)**\n   - HMT leverages memory-augmented segment-level recurrence to organize the memory hierarchy. This involves preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory embeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history. This hierarchical structure allows for efficient access to long-range contextual information, which is crucial for tasks requiring long-term dependencies.\n\n2. **Memory-Augmented Segment-Level Recurrence**\n   - This approach involves segmenting the input sequence into smaller chunks and maintaining a hierarchical memory structure. Each segment's memory embeddings are passed along the sequence, allowing the model to recall relevant information from earlier segments efficiently. This method is particularly effective for long-context language processing and can be integrated into TTT architectures to enhance their performance.\n\n3. **PatchTST and Crossformer**\n   - Models like PatchTST and Crossformer also employ hierarchical attention mechanisms. PatchTST segments time series data into patches and uses self-supervised learning to reconstruct them, enhancing local semantic information capture. Crossformer uses a dimension-segment-wise structure to capture dependencies across time and dimensions, which can be adapted for hierarchical memory integration in TTT architectures[3,.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, performance, and scalability of their autoregressive language models, particularly in the context of TTT architectures.\n",

Our method compresses the KV cache after every $t c$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression. ## 1. Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Extensible Embedding: A Flexible Multipler For LLM's Context Length (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Ninglu Shao, Shitao Xiao, Zheng Liu, Peitian Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) call for extension of context to handle many critical applications. However, the existing approaches are prone to expensive costs and inferior quality of context extension. In this work, we propose Extensible Embedding, which realizes high-quality extension of LLM's context with strong flexibility and cost-effectiveness. Extensible embedding stand as an enhancement of typical token embedding, which represents the information for an extensible scope of context instead of a single token. By leveraging such compact input units of higher information density, the LLM can access to a vast scope of context even with a small context window. Extensible embedding is systematically optimized in architecture and training method, which leads to multiple advantages. 1) High flexibility of context extension, which flexibly supports ad-hoc extension of diverse context lengths. 2) Strong sample efficiency of training, which enables the embedding model to be learned in a cost-effective way. 3) Superior compatibility with the existing LLMs, where the extensible embedding can be seamlessly introduced as a plug-in component. Comprehensive evaluations on long-context language modeling and understanding tasks verify extensible embedding as an effective, efficient, flexible, and compatible method to extend the LLM's context.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/19 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nHuiqiang Jiang, Qianhui Wu, Chin-Yew Lin, Yuqing Yang, and Lili Qiu. 2023.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n#### 2. Memorizing Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Yuhuai Wu, M. Rabe, DeLesley S. Hutchins, Christian Szegedy*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 138  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext, math papers, books, code, as well as formal theorems (Isabelle).\n\n**Abstract:** Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nJack W.

Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"lossless memory compression\", \"moving average attention\", \"hierarchical memory transformer\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. SSMF: Shifting Seasonal Matrix Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: \"lossless memory compression\"*\n\n*Koki Kawabata, Siddharth Bhatia, R. Liu, Mohit Wadhwa, Bryan Hooi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Shifting Seasonal Matrix Factorization approach, namely SSMF, that can adaptively learn multiple seasonal patterns (called regimes), as well as switching between them, and demonstrates that the algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by accurately forecasting upcoming events on three real-world data streams.\n\n**Abstract:** Given taxi-ride counts information between departure and destination locations, how can we forecast their future demands? In general, given a data stream of events with seasonal patterns that innovate over time, how can we effectively and efficiently forecast future events? In this paper, we propose Shifting Seasonal Matrix Factorization approach, namely SSMF, that can adaptively learn multiple seasonal patterns (called regimes), as well as switching between them. Our proposed method has the following properties: (a) it accurately forecasts future events by detecting regime shifts in seasonal patterns as the data stream evolves; (b) it works in an online setting, i.e., processes each observation in constant time and memory; (c) it effectively realizes regime shifts without human intervention by using a lossless data compression scheme. We demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods by accurately forecasting upcoming events on three real-world data streams.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. DemaFormer: Damped Exponential Moving Average Transformer with Energy-Based Modeling for Temporal Language Grounding\n\n*From Search Query: \"moving average attention\"*\n\n*Thong Nguyen, Xiaobao Wu, Xinshuai Dong, Cong-Duy Nguyen, See-Kiong Ng, Anh Tuan Luu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment- query distributions is proposed and DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal Language Grounding seeks to localize video moments that semantically correspond to a natural language query. Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs. Comprehensive experiments on four public temporal language grounding datasets showcase the superiority of our methods over the state-of-the-art baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Unified Generative Adversarial Network Training via Self-Labeling and Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"moving average attention\"*\n\n*Tomoki Watanabe, P. Favaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a form of artificial labeling that can incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an alignment between them, and finds that the proposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel GAN training scheme that can handle any level of labeling in a unified manner. Our scheme introduces a form of artificial labeling that can incorporate manually defined labels, when available, and induce an alignment between them. To define the artificial labels, we exploit the assumption that neural network generators can be trained more easily to map nearby latent vectors to data with semantic similarities, than across separate categories. We use generated data samples and their corresponding artificial conditioning labels to train a classifier. The classifier is then used to self-label real data. To boost the accuracy of the self-labeling, we also use the exponential moving average of the classifier. However, because the classifier might still make mistakes, especially at the beginning of the training, we also refine the labels through self-attention, by using the labeling of real data samples only when the classifier outputs a high classification probability score. We evaluate our approach on CIFAR-10, STL-10 and SVHN, and show that both self-labeling and self-attention consistently improve the quality of generated data. More surprisingly, we find that the proposed scheme can even outperform class-conditional GANs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory transformer\"*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. GPViT: A High Resolution Non-Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Group Propagation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory transformer\"*\n\n*Chenhongyi Yang, Jiarui Xu, Shalini De Mello, Elliot J. Crowley, X. Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT) is presented, a novel nonhierarchical transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features that achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs.\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Group Propagation Vision Transformer (GPViT): a novel nonhierarchical (i.e. non-pyramidal) transformer model designed for general visual recognition with high-resolution features. High-resolution features (or tokens) are a natural fit for tasks that involve perceiving fine-grained details such as detection and segmentation, but exchanging global information between these features is expensive in memory and computation because of the way self-attention scales. We provide a highly efficient alternative Group Propagation Block (GP Block) to exchange global information. In each GP Block, features are first grouped together by a fixed number of learnable group tokens; we then perform Group Propagation where global information is exchanged between the grouped features; finally, global information in the updated grouped features is returned back to the image features through a transformer decoder. We evaluate GPViT on a variety of visual recognition tasks including image classification, semantic segmentation, object detection, and instance segmentation. Our method achieves significant performance gains over previous works across all tasks, especially on tasks that require highresolution outputs, for example, our GPViT-L3 outperforms Swin Transformer-B by 2.0 mIoU on ADE20K semantic segmentation with only half as many parameters.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"lossless memory compression\"*\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU\nmemory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify\nthe Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to\nalleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We\nintroduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that\nenables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and\ncomputational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a\nspecialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive\ngeneration algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method\ncompresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression\nratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within\na single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered\nan efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and\nposition identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental\nvalidation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational\nconsumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16T09:18:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-04T03:14:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. SpQR: A Sparse-Quantized Representation for Near-Lossless LLM Weight\n  Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"lossless memory compression\"*\n\n*Tim Dettmers, Ruslan Svirschevski, Vage Egiazarian, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Saleh Ashkboos, Alexander Borzunov, Torsten Hoefler, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have led to\nhigh-quality LLMs with impressive abilities. By compressing such LLMs via\nquantization to 3-4 bits per parameter, they can fit into memory-limited\ndevices such as laptops and mobile phones, enabling personalized use. However,\nquantization down to 3-4 bits per parameter usually leads to moderate-to-high\naccuracy losses, especially for smaller models in the 1-10B parameter range,\nwhich are well-suited for edge deployments. To address this accuracy issue, we\nintroduce the Sparse-Quantized Representation (SpQR), a new compressed format\nand quantization technique which enables for the first time near-lossless\ncompression of LLMs across model scales, while reaching similar compression\nlevels to previous methods. SpQR works by identifying and isolating outlier\nweights, which cause particularly-large quantization errors, and storing them\nin higher precision, while compressing all other weights to 3-4 bits, and\nachieves relative accuracy losses of less than 1% in perplexity for\nhighly-accurate LLaMA and Falcon LLMs. This makes it possible to run 33B\nparameter LLM on a single 24 GB consumer GPU without any performance\ndegradation at 15% speedup thus making powerful LLMs available to consumer\nwithout any downsides. SpQR comes with efficient algorithms for both encoding\nweights into its format, as well as decoding them efficiently at runtime.\nSpecifically, we provide an efficient GPU inference algorithm for SpQR which\nyields faster inference than 16-bit baselines at similar accuracy, while\nenabling memory compression gains of more than 4x.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-05T17:53:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-06-05T17:53:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Unveiling and Harnessing Hidden Attention Sinks: Enhancing Large\n  Language Models without Training through Attention Calibration\n\n*From Search Query: \"moving average attention\"*\n\n*Zhongzhi Yu, Zheng Wang, Yonggan Fu, Huihong Shi, Khalid Shaikh, Yingyan Celine Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a fundamental component behind the remarkable achievements of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, our current understanding of the\nattention mechanism, especially regarding how attention distributions are\nestablished, remains limited. Inspired by recent studies that explore the\npresence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives\ndisproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic\nimportance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a\nmore profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and\nto uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly\noptimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning.\nSpecifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the\nattention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and\ntasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of\nsequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention\nsinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon\nour findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT)\nthat automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during\ninference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT\nconsistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different\napplications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to 7.30%\nin accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B.

We analyze the advantages of learned representations at multiple\nscales in terms of memory footprint, compute time, and perplexity, which are\nparticularly appealing given the quadratic scaling of transformers' run time\nand memory usage with respect to sequence length.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01T19:58:56Z  (*Updated: 2020-05-01T19:58:56Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. HMT: Hierarchical Memory Transformer for Long Context Language\n  Processing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory transformer\"*\n\n*Zifan He, Zongyue Qin, Neha Prakriya, Yizhou Sun, Jason Cong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based large language models (LLM) have been widely used in\nlanguage processing applications. However, most of them restrict the context\nwindow that permits the model to attend to every token in the inputs. Previous\nworks in recurrent models can memorize past tokens to enable unlimited context\nand maintain effectiveness. However, they have \"flat\" memory architectures,\nwhich have limitations in selecting and filtering information. Since humans are\ngood at learning and self-adjustment, we speculate that imitating brain memory\nhierarchy is beneficial for model memorization. We propose the Hierarchical\nMemory Transformer (HMT), a novel framework that enables and improves models'\nlong-context processing ability by imitating human memorization behavior.\nLeveraging memory-augmented segment-level recurrence, we organize the memory\nhierarchy by preserving tokens from early input token segments, passing memory\nembeddings along the sequence, and recalling relevant information from history.\nEvaluating general language modeling (Wikitext-103, PG-19) and\nquestion-answering tasks (PubMedQA), we show that HMT steadily improves the\nlong-context processing ability of context-constrained and long-context models.\nWith an additional 0.5% - 2% of parameters, HMT can easily plug in and augment\nfuture LLMs to handle long context effectively.

SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"lossless memory compression\"*\n\n*Kurt Keutzer, Michael W. Mahoney, Sheng Shen, Xiuyu Li, Zhen Dong, Amir Gholami, Coleman Hooper, Sehoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"moving average attention\"*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. SPARTAN: Sparse Hierarchical Memory for Parameter-Efficient Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory transformer\"*\n\n*Avirup Sil, Karthik Narasimhan, Ashwin Kalyan, Anthony Ferritto, Md Arafat Sultan, Ameet Deshpande*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained language models (PLMs) achieves impressive performance on a range of downstream tasks, and their sizes have consequently been getting bigger. Since a different copy of the model is required for each task, this paradigm is infeasible for storage-constrained edge devices like mobile phones. In this paper, we propose SPARTAN, a parameter efficient (PE) and computationally fast architecture for edge devices that adds hierarchically organized sparse memory after each Transformer layer. SPARTAN freezes the PLM parameters and fine-tunes only its memory, thus significantly reducing storage costs by re-using the PLM backbone for different tasks. SPARTAN contains two levels of memory, with only a sparse subset of parents being chosen in the first level for each input, and children cells corresponding to those parents being used to compute an output representation. This sparsity combined with other architecture optimizations improves SPARTAN's throughput by over 90% during inference on a Raspberry Pi 4 when compared to PE baselines (adapters) while also outperforming the latter by 0.1 points on the GLUE benchmark. Further, it can be trained 34% faster in a few-shot setting, while performing within 0.9 points of adapters. Qualitative analysis shows that different parent cells in SPARTAN specialize in different topics, thus dividing responsibility efficiently.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the TTTLinear model by integrating lossless memory compression, moving average attention, and hierarchical memory organization, here are the key insights and useful information that can be gathered from the provided analysis and additional research:\n\n## Novelty of the Approach\nThe integration of lossless memory compression, moving average attention, and hierarchical memory organization within the TTTLinear unit appears to be a novel approach. While individual components have been explored in prior research, their specific combination in this context has not been documented. For example:\n- **Ma et al., 2022** introduced Mega, which uses moving average equipped gated attention, but this is not combined with lossless memory compression and hierarchical memory organization.\n- **Wang & Xiao, 2024** proposed LoMA, focusing on lossless compressed memory attention, but without the hierarchical memory and moving average attention components.\n- **He et al., 2024** presented HMT, which uses a hierarchical memory structure, but this is not integrated with the other two components.\n\n## Feasibility of Implementation\n### Lossless Memory Compression\nImplementing lossless memory compression is crucial but challenging. The researcher needs to ensure that no vital information is lost during compression. Studies like **Nawrot et al., 2024** on dynamic memory compression can provide insights into how to retrofit large language models for accelerated inference without significant performance loss.\n\n### Moving Average Attention\nMoving average attention, as introduced in **Ma et al., 2022**, is theoretically compatible with TTTLinear. However, its impact on test-time training dynamics and stability needs to be evaluated. Theoretical analyses and experimental results from Mega can guide this integration.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Organization\nHierarchical memory organization may increase model complexity and computational overhead. Balancing these factors against performance gains is crucial. **He et al., 2024** provides a framework for hierarchical memory transformers that can be adapted to TTTLinear.\n\n## Impact on Performance\n### Perplexity and Local Dependencies\nThe moving average attention mechanism can improve the modeling of local dependencies, potentially reducing perplexity. This is supported by the work on Mega, which shows improved performance in capturing position-aware local dependencies.\n\n### Computational Efficiency and Scalability\nLossless memory compression can significantly reduce memory requirements, enhancing scalability and efficiency during training and inference. **Wang & Xiao, 2024** and **Nawrot et al., 2024** provide methods to achieve this without compromising performance.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory and Information Routing\nHierarchical memory organization can facilitate better information routing across different temporal scales, possibly improving downstream task accuracy. **He et al., 2024** demonstrates how this can be achieved in long-context language processing tasks.\n\n## Comparison with Similar Designs\n### MetaTTT and LightningTTTLinear\n- **MetaTTT** focuses on meta-learning and uncertainty-aware compression, which is different from the proposed lossless compression and moving average attention.\n- **LightningTTTLinear** integrates Lightning Attention and gating mechanisms but does not include the specific enhancements proposed here.\n\n## Future Search Plan and Next Steps\n### Investigate Existing Implementations\nSearch for any existing implementations or studies that have attempted to combine these techniques within TTTLinear or similar models. This includes looking into preprints and conference papers on arXiv, ResearchGate, and other academic databases.\n\n### Assess Practical Challenges\nLook into potential training stability issues that might arise from integrating these components. Explore optimization strategies to mitigate any added computational overhead. This could involve examining the stability and optimization techniques used in similar models.\n\n### Examine Theoretical Foundations\nReview theoretical analyses of each component to understand their compatibility and potential synergies. This includes studying the mathematical foundations of moving average attention, lossless compression, and hierarchical memory structures.\n\n## Useful References\nHere are some references that can be particularly useful:\n\n1. **Ma, X., Zhou, C., Kong, X., et al.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.32)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A. Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"test-time training memory compression\", \"moving average attention transformer\", \"hierarchical memory in autoregressive models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training memory compression\"*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Current state-of-the-art approaches use a memory of previously processed frames and rely on matching to estimate segmentation masks of subsequent frames. Lacking any adaptation mechanism, such methods are prone to test-time distribution shifts. This work focuses on matching-based VOS under distribution shifts such as video corruptions, stylization, and sim-to-real transfer. We explore test-time training strategies that are agnostic to the specific task as well as strategies that are designed specifically for VOS. This includes a variant based on mask cycle consistency tailored to matching-based VOS methods. The experimental results on common benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed test-time training yields significant improvements in performance. In particular for the sim-to-real scenario and despite using only a single test video, our approach manages to recover a substantial portion of the performance gain achieved through training on real videos.

Hosting these models at scale requires significant memory resources. One crucial memory bottleneck for the deployment stems from the context window. It is commonly recognized that model weights are memory hungry; however, the size of key-value embedding stored during the generation process (KV cache) can easily surpass the model size. The enormous size of the KV cache puts constraints on the inference batch size, which is crucial for high throughput inference workload. Inspired by an interesting observation of the attention scores, we hypothesize the persistence of importance: only pivotal tokens, which had a substantial influence at one step, will significantly influence future generations. Based on our empirical verification and theoretical analysis around this hypothesis, we propose Scissorhands, a system that maintains the memory usage of the KV cache at a fixed budget without finetuning the model. In essence, Scissorhands manages the KV cache by storing the pivotal tokens with a higher probability. We validate that Scissorhands reduces the inference memory usage of the KV cache by up to 5X without compromising model quality. We further demonstrate that Scissorhands can be combined with 4-bit quantization, traditionally used to compress model weights, to achieve up to 20X compression.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4.

Recent advances employ the attention mechanism to learn the relations between video moments and the text query. However, naive attention might not be able to appropriately capture such relations, resulting in ineffective distributions where target video moments are difficult to separate from the remaining ones. To resolve the issue, we propose an energy-based model framework to explicitly learn moment-query distributions. Moreover, we propose DemaFormer, a novel Transformer-based architecture that utilizes exponential moving average with a learnable damping factor to effectively encode moment-query inputs.

However, due to the auto-regressive architecture and self-attention in the decoder, the decoding procedure becomes slow. To alleviate this issue, we propose an average attention network as an alternative to the self-attention network in the decoder of the neural Transformer. The average attention network consists of two layers, with an average layer that models dependencies on previous positions and a gating layer that is stacked over the average layer to enhance the expressiveness of the proposed attention network. We apply this network on the decoder part of the neural Transformer to replace the original target-side self-attention model. With masking tricks and dynamic programming, our model enables the neural Transformer to decode sentences over four times faster than its original version with almost no loss in training time and translation performance. We conduct a series of experiments on WMT17 translation tasks, where on 6 different language pairs, we obtain robust and consistent speed-ups in decoding.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 6. Autoregressive Search Engines: Generating Substrings as Document Identifiers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory in autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Michele Bevilacqua, G. Ottaviano, Patrick Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Sebastian Riedel, F. Petroni*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all ngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers, which outperforms prior autoregressive approaches and leads to an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval solutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge-intensive language tasks require NLP systems to both provide the correct answer and retrieve supporting evidence for it in a given corpus. Autoregressive language models are emerging as the de-facto standard for generating answers, with newer and more powerful systems emerging at an astonishing pace. In this paper we argue that all this (and future) progress can be directly applied to the retrieval problem with minimal intervention to the models' architecture. Previous work has explored ways to partition the search space into hierarchical structures and retrieve documents by autoregressively generating their unique identifier. In this work we propose an alternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all ngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers. This setup allows us to use an autoregressive model to generate and score distinctive ngrams, that are then mapped to full passages through an efficient data structure. Empirically, we show this not only outperforms prior autoregressive approaches but also leads to an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval solutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art downstream performance on some datasets, while using a considerably lighter memory footprint than competing systems.

LoMA: Lossless Compressed Memory Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training memory compression\"*\n\n*Yumeng Wang, Zhenyang Xiao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) face limitations due to the high demand on GPU\nmemory and computational resources when handling long contexts. While sparsify\nthe Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to\nalleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We\nintroduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that\nenables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and\ncomputational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a\nspecialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive\ngeneration algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method\ncompresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression\nratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within\na single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered\nan efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and\nposition identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental\nvalidation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational\nconsumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-16T09:18:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-04T03:14:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training memory compression\"*\n\n*Yara Shamshoum, Nitzan Hodos, Yuval Sieradzki, Assaf Schuster*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce CompAct, a technique that reduces peak memory utilization on GPU\nby 25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning of LLMs. Peak device memory\nis a major limiting factor in training LLMs, with various recent works aiming\nto reduce model memory. However most works don't target the largest component\nof allocated memory during training: the model's compute graph, which is stored\nfor the backward pass. By storing low-rank, compressed activations to be used\nin the backward pass we greatly reduce the required memory, unlike previous\nmethods which only reduce optimizer overheads or the number of trained\nparameters. Our compression uses random projection matrices, thus avoiding\nadditional memory overheads. Comparisons with previous techniques for either\npretraining or fine-tuning show that CompAct substantially improves existing\ncompute-performance tradeoffs. We expect CompAct's savings to scale even higher\nfor larger models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-20T10:24:38Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-20T10:24:38Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence\nmodeling with unlimited context length.

Questioning the Importance of\n  Attention in Pretrained Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"moving average attention transformer\"*\n\n*Michael Hassid, Hao Peng, Daniel Rotem, Jungo Kasai, Ivan Montero, Noah A. Smith, Roy Schwartz*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism is considered the backbone of the widely-used\nTransformer architecture. It contextualizes the input by computing\ninput-specific attention matrices. We find that this mechanism, while powerful\nand elegant, is not as important as typically thought for pretrained language\nmodels. We introduce PAPA, a new probing method that replaces the\ninput-dependent attention matrices with constant ones -- the average attention\nweights over multiple inputs. We use PAPA to analyze several established\npretrained Transformers on six downstream tasks. We find that without any\ninput-dependent attention, all models achieve competitive performance -- an\naverage relative drop of only 8% from the probing baseline. Further, little or\nno performance drop is observed when replacing half of the input-dependent\nattention matrices with constant (input-independent) ones. Interestingly, we\nshow that better-performing models lose more from applying our method than\nweaker models, suggesting that the utilization of the input-dependent attention\nmechanism might be a factor in their success. Our results motivate research on\nsimpler alternatives to input-dependent attention, as well as on methods for\nbetter utilization of this mechanism in the Transformer architecture.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-07T12:37:54Z  (*Updated: 2022-11-07T12:37:54Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Fast Multipole Attention: A Divide-and-Conquer Attention Mechanism for\n  Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory in autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Yanming Kang, Giang Tran, Hans De Sterck*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance in many\nareas. However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention with respect to the\ninput length hinders the applicability of Transformer-based models to long\nsequences. To address this, we present Fast Multipole Attention, a new\nattention mechanism that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to reduce the time\nand memory complexity of attention for sequences of length $n$ from\n$\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$ or $O(n)$, while retaining a\nglobal receptive field. The hierarchical approach groups queries, keys, and\nvalues into $\\mathcal{O}( \\log n)$ levels of resolution, where groups at\ngreater distances are increasingly larger in size and the weights to compute\ngroup quantities are learned. As such, the interaction between tokens far from\neach other is considered in lower resolution in an efficient hierarchical\nmanner. The overall complexity of Fast Multipole Attention is $\\mathcal{O}(n)$\nor $\\mathcal{O}(n \\log n)$, depending on whether the queries are down-sampled\nor not. This multi-level divide-and-conquer strategy is inspired by fast\nsummation methods from $n$-body physics and the Fast Multipole Method. We\nperform evaluation on autoregressive and bidirectional language modeling tasks\nand compare our Fast Multipole Attention model with other efficient attention\nvariants on medium-size datasets. We find empirically that the Fast Multipole\nTransformer performs much better than other efficient transformers in terms of\nmemory size and accuracy. The Fast Multipole Attention mechanism has the\npotential to empower large language models with much greater sequence lengths,\ntaking the full context into account in an efficient, naturally hierarchical\nmanner during training and when generating long sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18T13:40:41Z  (*Updated: 2024-07-30T15:02:51Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Solving 3D Inverse Problems using Pre-trained 2D Diffusion Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training memory compression\"*\n\n*Jong Chul Ye, Marc L. Klasky, Michael T. McCann, Dohoon Ryu, Hyungjin Chung*\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models have emerged as the new state-of-the-art generative model with high quality samples, with intriguing properties such as mode coverage and high flexibility. They have also been shown to be effective inverse problem solvers, acting as the prior of the distribution, while the information of the forward model can be granted at the sampling stage. Nonetheless, as the generative process remains in the same high dimensional (i.e. identical to data dimension) space, the models have not been extended to 3D inverse problems due to the extremely high memory and computational cost. In this paper, we combine the ideas from the conventional model-based iterative reconstruction with the modern diffusion models, which leads to a highly effective method for solving 3D medical image reconstruction tasks such as sparse-view tomography, limited angle tomography, compressed sensing MRI from pre-trained 2D diffusion models. In essence, we propose to augment the 2D diffusion prior with a model-based prior in the remaining direction at test time, such that one can achieve coherent reconstructions across all dimensions. Our method can be run in a single commodity GPU, and establishes the new state-of-the-art, showing that the proposed method can perform reconstructions of high fidelity and accuracy even in the most extreme cases (e.g. 2-view 3D tomography). We further reveal that the generalization capacity of the proposed method is surprisingly high, and can be used to reconstruct volumes that are entirely different from the training dataset.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. OctAttention: Octree-Based Large-Scale Contexts Model for Point Cloud Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"test-time training memory compression\"*\n\n*Shan Liu, Wei Gao, Rui Song, Ge Li, Chunyang Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** In point cloud compression, sufficient contexts are significant for modeling the point cloud distribution. However, the contexts gathered by the previous voxel-based methods decrease when handling sparse point clouds. To address this problem, we propose a multiple-contexts deep learning framework called OctAttention employing the octree structure, a memory-efficient representation for point clouds. Our approach encodes octree symbol sequences in a lossless way by gathering the information of sibling and ancestor nodes. Expressly, we first represent point clouds with octree to reduce spatial redundancy, which is robust for point clouds with different resolutions. We then design a conditional entropy model with a large receptive field that models the sibling and ancestor contexts to exploit the strong dependency among the neighboring nodes and employ an attention mechanism to emphasize the correlated nodes in the context. Furthermore, we introduce a mask operation during training and testing to make a trade-off between encoding time and performance. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art works, our approach obtains a 10%-35% BD-Rate gain on the LiDAR benchmark (e.g. SemanticKITTI) and object point cloud dataset (e.g. MPEG 8i, MVUB), and saves 95% coding time compared to the voxel-based baseline.

In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Block Transformer: Global-to-Local Language Modeling for Fast Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical memory in autoregressive models\"*\n\n*Se-Young Yun, James Thorne, Adam Fisch, Tal Schuster, Yireun Kim, Hyunjik Jo, Taehyeon Kim, Sangmin Bae, Namgyu Ho*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents the Block Transformer architecture which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling to autoregressive transformers to mitigate the inference bottlenecks of self-attention. To apply self-attention, the key-value (KV) cache of all previous sequences must be retrieved from memory at every decoding step. Thereby, this KV cache IO becomes a significant bottleneck in batch inference. We notice that these costs stem from applying self-attention on the global context, therefore we isolate the expensive bottlenecks of global modeling to lower layers and apply fast local modeling in upper layers. To mitigate the remaining costs in the lower layers, we aggregate input tokens into fixed size blocks and then apply self-attention at this coarse level. Context information is aggregated into a single embedding to enable upper layers to decode the next block of tokens, without global attention. Free of global attention bottlenecks, the upper layers can fully utilize the compute hardware to maximize inference throughput. By leveraging global and local modules, the Block Transformer architecture demonstrates 10-20x gains in inference throughput compared to vanilla transformers with equivalent perplexity. Our work introduces a new approach to optimize language model inference through novel application of global-to-local modeling.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

Performance analysis\n\nIn this analysis, we evaluated the extent to which LoMA reduces the computational and storage resource requirements. Without loss of generality, we compared the standard autoregressive generation algorithm with the LoMA generation in the absence of prompts. Let $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ denote the time it takes for the model to complete one inference on a token sequence of length $l$ with a key-value (KV) cache of length $k$. Assuming the total generation spans $m$ chunks, each consisting of $t c$ tokens, the generation time for a traditional transformer is given by:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{m t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)\n$$\n\nUnder a preset compression ratio $c$ and memory length $t$, LoMA performs one inference every $t c$ tokens with $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens, resulting in a total generation time of:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y=0}^{m} \\sum_{k=y t}^{y t+t c-1} T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)+m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)\n$$\n\nTypically, $T_{\\text {infer }}(l, k)$ is much less than $l T_{\\text {infer }}(1, k)$. Our tests conducted on an A100 GPU demonstrate this point, see Fig. 2. Consequently, even though the additional term $m T_{\\text {infer }}(t c, t)$ of the LoMA generation process slightly increases the computation, the significant compression of the KV cache results in a notable reduction in both generation time and memory usage, as illustrated in the table 1. ## 4. Training\n\nTo equip the transformer model with the aforementioned memory compression capability, pre-training or fine-tuning procedures are essential. We have devised a training procedure that includes structured reorganization of input samples, a novel loss terms, a unique design attention mask, and a specialized pattern of PositionIDs. ### 4.1. Input Samples\n\nIn the training procedure of LoMA, the original sequence of tokens is segmented into multiple subsequences each of length $t c$. To each subsequence, $t$ ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens followed by $t c$ '<r>' tokens are appended, forming a training chunk. All training chunks are concatenated to form a new structured sequence as a training sample. see Fig 3. ### 4.2. Loss\n\nTo train a Transformer model using the structured input sequence mentioned above, it is necessary to extend the vanilla loss $\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{LM}}$ with an additional term that endows the model with the capability to compress memory. Since the output of model on the memory zone is not of concern, with the KV-cache in this zone being utilized to store compressed information, there is no need to design labels or a loss function for the memory zone. Indirectly, the memory zone is supervised through the loss applied to the repetition zone. Consequently, the training loss for each chunk is calculated as the sum of these two components, and the total loss across all chunks is determined by:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}=\\sum_{y=1}^{m}\\left(\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}+\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}$ is the loss generated by the reading zone of the $y$-th training chunk while $\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Rep }}^{y}$ corresponds to the loss produced by the repetition zone. Let the token subsequence from the reading zone be denoted as $\\operatorname{READ}_{y}=\\left\\{x_{k}, x_{k+1}, \\ldots, x_{k+t c}\\right\\}$, we have:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\text {Read }}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left(x_{i}\\right), x_{i+1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis same with the standard trainning loss and\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{L}_{\\mathrm{REP}}^{y}=\\sum_{i=k}^{k+t c} \\mathrm{CE}\\left(M\\left({ }^{\\prime}<\\mathrm{r}>^{\\prime}{ }_{i+t(c+1)}\\right), x_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathrm{CE}($ logits, label) refers to the standard cross-entropy loss function, and the $M(x)$ is the set of logits produced\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-04.jpg?height=324&width=836&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=1054)\n\nFigure 4: This figure describes the correspondence between inputs and labels. In reading zone, the input and target exhibit a standard autoregressive relationship. No labels are set in the memory zone, while the labels in the repetition zone consist of content from the reading zone. We demonstrated in Section.4.4 that by backpropagating gradients through the repetition zone, a supervisory signal can be provided to the memory zone. This allows the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' token to learn to compress the content of the reading zone into its own KV . by the model $M$ for the token $x$. The term ' $<\\mathrm{r}>{ }^{\\prime}{ }_{k+t(c+1)}$ refers to the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token at position $k+t(c+1)$, indicating that the model's prediction for each ' $<$ r>' token should be identical with the corresponding token in the reading zone.\n```\n\n#### 2.

This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/29 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nJie Lei, Liwei Wang, Yelong Shen, Dong Yu, Tamara L.

Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"TTTLinear memory compression\"*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Memory Replay with Data Compression for Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"TTTLinear memory compression\"*\n\n*Liyuan Wang, Xingxing Zhang, Kuo Yang, L. Yu, Chongxuan Li, Lanqing Hong, Shifeng Zhang, Zhenguo Li, Yi Zhong, Jun Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality for currently-arrived training samples to reduce the storage cost of old training samples and thus increase their amount that can be stored in the memory buffer.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning needs to overcome catastrophic forgetting of the past. Memory replay of representative old training samples has been shown as an effective solution, and achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. However, existing work is mainly built on a small memory buffer containing a few original data, which cannot fully characterize the old data distribution. In this work, we propose memory replay with data compression (MRDC) to reduce the storage cost of old training samples and thus increase their amount that can be stored in the memory buffer. Observing that the trade-off between the quality and quantity of compressed data is highly nontrivial for the efficacy of memory replay, we propose a novel method based on determinantal point processes (DPPs) to efficiently determine an appropriate compression quality for currently-arrived training samples. In this way, using a naive data compression algorithm with a properly selected quality can largely boost recent strong baselines by saving more compressed data in a limited storage space. We extensively validate this across several benchmarks of class-incremental learning and in a realistic scenario of object detection for autonomous driving.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

We conduct experiments across multiple\nlanguages, both in low resource in-domain and in cross-domain setups, and\ndemonstrate that DCST substantially outperforms traditional self-training as\nwell as recent semi-supervised training methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-11T14:07:46Z  (*Updated: 2019-11-11T14:07:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: \"combining moving average attention with TTT models\"*\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity.\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long\ncontext is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a\nnew class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive\nhidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model\nitself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the\nhidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are\ncalled Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations:\nTTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer\nMLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B\nparameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both\nTTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer,\nthey can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba\ncannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is\nalready faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock\ntime. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential\nin long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05T16:23:20Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-11T00:42:18Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

We introduce Megalodon, a neural architecture for efficient sequence\nmodeling with unlimited context length. Megalodon inherits the architecture of\nMega (exponential moving average with gated attention), and further introduces\nmultiple technical components to improve its capability and stability,\nincluding complex exponential moving average (CEMA), timestep normalization\nlayer, normalized attention mechanism and pre-norm with two-hop residual\nconfiguration. In a controlled head-to-head comparison with Llama2, Megalodon\nachieves better efficiency than Transformer in the scale of 7 billion\nparameters and 2 trillion training tokens. Megalodon reaches a training loss of\n1.70, landing mid-way between Llama2-7B (1.75) and 13B (1.67).
