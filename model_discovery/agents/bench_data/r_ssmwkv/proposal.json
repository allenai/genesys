    "review": "### Comprehensive Review of R-SSMWKV Proposal\n\n#### 1. Summary of Analysis\n\nThe **R-SSMWKV** proposal introduces a significant enhancement to the **RWKV6FeedForward** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating a **Gated State Space Model (GSSM)**. This integration aims to bolster the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, enhance expressiveness, and maintain computational efficiency in language modeling tasks. Comprehensive analysis of both internal and external research reveals that while GSSMs have been successfully integrated into various architectures to improve long-range dependency modeling and expressiveness, the specific application within the RWKV6FeedForward unit remains largely unexplored. This distinct focus underscores the proposal's novelty and potential impact.\n\n#### 2. Comprehensive Analysis of Strengths and Concerns\n\n##### **Strengths:**\n\n1. **Novel Integration:**\n   - **Uniqueness:** The proposal uniquely targets the integration of GSSMs into the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit. Existing models like **RRWKV** and **Mamba** have enhanced different components of the RWKV architecture or employed selective state spaces but have not specifically modified the feedforward units. This distinct approach positions **R-SSMWKV** as a novel contribution to the field.\n   \n2. **Enhanced Expressiveness and Adaptability:**\n   - **Gating Mechanism:** Incorporating gating mechanisms within GSSMs allows dynamic regulation of information flow, enhancing the model's ability to capture complex patterns and long-range dependencies effectively.\n   - **State Space Efficiency:** GSSMs provide a structured approach to modeling sequences, which can lead to better expressiveness without significantly increasing computational overhead.\n   \n3. **Training Efficiency:**\n   - **Faster Training:** As demonstrated in **Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces** by Mehta et al. (2022), GSSMs can train faster than traditional SSM variants like S4, aligning with the RWKV architecture's emphasis on computational efficiency.\n   \n4. **Performance Improvements:**\n   - **Perplexity and Accuracy:** The integration is expected to lower perplexity scores and improve accuracy on downstream tasks such as text classification and generation, as GSSMs have shown promising results in similar contexts.\n   - **Robustness:** The dynamic gating mechanism can enhance the model's robustness to varied and noisy inputs, improving overall reliability.\n   \n5. **Compatibility with RWKV Architecture:**\n   - **Linear Complexity Maintenance:** The RWKV architecture's linear computational complexity aligns well with the integration of GSSMs, ensuring that efficiency is preserved.\n   - **Parameter Management:** Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be leveraged to manage the additional parameters introduced by GSSMs, maintaining model scalability and efficiency.\n\n##### **Concerns:**\n\n1. **Implementation Complexity:**\n   - **Architectural Adjustments:** Integrating GSSMs into the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit requires careful architectural modifications to ensure seamless functionality without disrupting the existing framework.\n   - **Parameter Overhead:** Although techniques like LoRA can mitigate parameter increases, the addition of GSSMs inherently introduces more parameters, which may impact memory usage and computational resources.\n   \n2. **Training Stability:**\n   - **Gradient Flow:** The incorporation of gating mechanisms may affect gradient flow, potentially leading to issues like vanishing or exploding gradients. Mitigating this requires strategies such as gradient clipping and careful initialization.\n   \n3. **Scalability Concerns:**\n   - **Large Model Handling:** While GSSMs are efficient, scaling them within the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit to very large models or extremely long sequences may present unforeseen challenges related to memory management and computational load.\n   \n4. **Empirical Validation:**\n   - **Lack of Direct Comparisons:** The proposal currently lacks empirical results demonstrating the effectiveness of the integration within the RWKV architecture. Benchmarking against existing models is crucial to substantiate the theoretical benefits.\n   \n5. **Operational Alignment:**\n   - **State Management:** Ensuring that the GSSM's state updates align perfectly with the time-shifted operations inherent in the RWKV architecture is essential to maintain model integrity and performance.\n\n#### 3. Constructive Suggestions for Improvements\n\n1. **Empirical Evaluation:**\n   - **Benchmarking:** Conduct extensive experiments to benchmark **R-SSMWKV** against existing models like **RRWKV**, **Mamba**, and standard Transformers. Focus on metrics such as perplexity, accuracy on diverse NLP tasks, and computational efficiency.\n   \n2. **Implementation Guidelines:**\n   - **Detailed Integration Strategy:** Provide a comprehensive implementation guide detailing how GSSMs can be integrated into the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit. Include pseudocode, architectural diagrams, and parameter management techniques.\n   \n3. **Training Stability Measures:**\n   - **Gradient Management:** Incorporate techniques like gradient clipping, advanced optimization algorithms, and careful weight initialization to ensure stable and efficient training.\n   \n4. **Scalability Solutions:**\n   - **Memory Optimization:** Explore memory-efficient implementations of GSSMs, possibly by leveraging sparse representations or parallel processing techniques.\n   - **Modular Design:** Design the integration in a modular fashion to facilitate scalability and ease of adjustments based on model size requirements.\n   \n5. **Hybrid Architectures:**\n   - **Combining with Attention Mechanisms:** Investigate the potential benefits of hybrid architectures that combine GSSMs with attention mechanisms to further enhance long-range dependency modeling.\n   \n6. **Documentation and Transparency:**\n   - **Comprehensive Documentation:** Ensure thorough documentation of the integration process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented to aid replication and further research.\n   \n7. **Community Engagement:**\n   - **Open-Source Release:** Consider open-sourcing the implementation to garner feedback, facilitate collaboration, and accelerate iterative improvements based on community insights.\n\n#### 4. Final Rating\n\n```rating 4.5```\n\n### Justification\n\nThe **R-SSMWKV** proposal stands out as an **excellent design** with a high degree of innovation by uniquely integrating Gated State Space Models into the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2205.14135, 2022.

Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/23 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.02173, 2017.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/31 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022. $\\left[\\mathrm{DSF}^{+}\\right.$24] Soham De, Samuel L Smith, Anushan Fernando, Aleksandar Botev, George CristianMuraru, Albert Gu, Ruba Haroun, Leonard Berrada, Yutian Chen, Srivatsan Srinivasan, et al.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models.

If five cats can catch five mice in five minutes, it means that each cat can catch one mouse in one minute. To find out how long it will take one cat to catch one mouse, we can use the concept of proportionality. Let's assume that it takes x minutes for a cat to catch a mouse. Then, the number of mice caught by a cat in one minute is equal to the number of cats multiplied by the number of mice caught by each cat: $x=5 * 1=5$\nSo, it will take 5 minutes for one cat to catch one mouse. ## RWKV-4-Raven-14B\n\nSummarize the following paragraph. <The Abstract of this paper goes here>\nThe paper presents a novel architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics.

Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing the `RWKV6FeedForward` model using advanced feedforward units, particularly those employing gating mechanisms like Gated Linear Units (GLU) and novel activation functions such as SwiGLU, here are the key points and useful information from the provided sources:\n\n## Gated Linear Units (GLU)\n\n- **Definition and Mechanism**: GLUs combine a linear transformation with a gating mechanism. They are formed by the element-wise multiplication of two linear projections, one of which is passed through a sigmoid function. This helps in adaptively selecting the information passed through the network, which is beneficial for capturing long-range dependencies and improving gradient flow.\n- **Benefits**: GLUs are particularly useful in deep learning models involving sequential data, such as in natural language processing. They help in reducing the vanishing gradient problem and improving the model's capacity to capture complex dependencies.\n\n## SwiGLU Activation Function\n\n- **Definition**: SwiGLU combines the Swish activation function with GLU. Swish is defined as \\( \\text{Swish}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta x) \\), where \\( \\sigma \\) is the sigmoid function, and \\( \\beta \\) is a trainable parameter. This combination introduces both non-linearity and a gating mechanism.\n- **Performance Gains**: SwiGLU has been shown to outperform traditional activation functions like ReLU in the feedforward layers of Transformer models. It consistently improves the quality of Transformer models on language tasks.\n\n## Implementation in Transformer Models\n\n- **Feedforward Layers**: In Transformer models, SwiGLU can be implemented by modifying the feedforward layers to compute two linear projections: one passed through the Swish function and another serving as a gate. The outputs are then combined via element-wise multiplication. This involves minimal architectural changes and does not significantly increase computational complexity.\n- **Examples**: Modern LLMs such as LLaMA2 and Mistral have adopted GLU variants, including SwiGLU, in their MLP modules. These models also use grouped-query attention (GQA), which, along with GLU-based MLP modules, accounts for a significant portion of the model's parameters and improves performance and efficiency.\n\n## Efficiency and Practical Considerations\n\n- **Computational Overhead**: SwiGLU does not introduce significant computational overhead compared to ReLU. It aligns with the goal of maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.\n- **Pruning and Sparsity**: When pruning LLMs, using GLU-based MLP modules requires careful consideration of the pruning granularity to maintain performance. Input-balanced pruning can help in preserving the weights connected to neurons with large activation norms, thus minimizing performance drops.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Expressiveness**: Gated activation functions like GLU and SwiGLU enhance the model's expressiveness by regulating information flow and capturing complex relationships within the data.\n- **Robustness**: These modifications have been shown to be robust across multiple implementations and tasks, suggesting their general applicability and potential benefits for the `RWKV6FeedForward` model.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Implementation Considerations**: Investigate any potential issues in integrating SwiGLU within the recursive and time-shifted operations of `RWKV6FeedForward`. Explore best practices for initializing and training models with gated activation functions to ensure stability.\n- **Efficiency Analysis**: Evaluate the computational overhead and hardware implications, particularly in terms of memory footprint and inference speed, when using SwiGLU in the `RWKV6FeedForward` model.\n\n### Useful References\n\n1. **Shazeer, N.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B.

SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIt is important to note that the choice and design of the scaffolding is not well-understood, and often the one that is most performant in practice is selected. ## III. REVIEW OF EXISTING METHODS\n\nIn this section, we present an overview of the most prominent SSM proposals in the literature. Since existing SSMs build on each other, the order of presentation in this section is chronological. We provide details as to how each of the architectures tackles the considerations described in Section $\\Pi$ We also provide a summary of their main characteristics in Table I. ## A. Structured State Space Sequence Model (S4)\n\nThe S4 model [12] was the first proposed model based on a state space representation. a) Parametrization: The S4 model starts from a continuous time model (3), where the structure imposed on matrix $A$ is\n\n$$\nA=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)+r s^{\\star}\n$$\n\nwith $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$, and $r, s \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$. This is, a diagonal matrix plus a low-rank update. We note that this structure resembles a closed-loop dynamics matrix $A_{C L}=A+B K$. b) Discretization: The discrete-time version (4) is computed by applying the bilinear transform to dynamics (3) with discretization step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{A}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1}\\left(I+\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right), \\quad \\bar{B}=\\left(I-\\frac{\\Delta}{2} A\\right)^{-1} \\Delta B\n$$\n\n$\\bar{C}=C$ and $\\bar{D}=D$. Note that this choice of discretization method couples the parameterizations of $\\bar{A}$ and $\\bar{B}$ via the discretization step $\\Delta$, which is a common feature of most SSMs. c) Structure and Initialization: The model is structured in a single input single output (SISO) manner, i.e., each component of the input (referred to as input channel) $u_{i}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, q$ is fed into a separate system (4), each producing a scalar output $y_{j}$ with $j=1, \\ldots, q$. Each dynamics matrix $A$ for each of the $q$ SISO subsystems is initialized using HiPPO theory [13], resulting in the eigenvalues shown in Figure 2. In essence, the HiPPO theory provides a mathematically grounded way to place the eigenvalues of a continuous-time dynamics matrix such that it can compress information over long input sequences into its state. Although the original S4 does not bias the initialization towards marginal stability to ensure long-range memory (as per Lemma 2.2), the follow up work SaShiMi [23] enforces $\\operatorname{Re}\\left(\\lambda_{i}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{-} \\forall i$ to ensure stability. d) Implementation: At training time, a convolutional representation (5) is used. For efficient computation, the structure of $\\bar{A}$ (6) is exploited since the Sherman-Morrison formula [24] can be used to compute its inverse in (7), resulting in only the inversion of scalars. At inference time, the recurrent representation of the model 4 is directly used. e) Scaffolding: Initially, the scaffolding proposed for the pre- and post-processing of the S4 block was identical to the one used for gated MLPs. Later on, a more sophisticated scaffolding, $H 3$ [25], was introduced to mimic the operations of a Transformer. The H3 scaffolding uses the sum of the original signal with a time-shifted version of the input signal for the linear map of the upper signal and a standard linear map for the lower signal in Figure 1.A.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 11 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated State Space Models\", \"SSM gating mechanisms\", \"Integrating GLU with SSM\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Artificial Neuronal Ensembles with Learned Context Dependent Gating\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*M. Tilley, Michelle Miller, David J. Freedman*\n\n**TL;DR:** Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG) is introduced, a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** Biological neural networks are capable of recruiting different sets of neurons to encode different memories. However, when training artificial neural networks on a set of tasks, typically, no mechanism is employed for selectively producing anything analogous to these neuronal ensembles. Further, artificial neural networks suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where the network's performance rapidly deteriorates as tasks are learned sequentially. By contrast, sequential learning is possible for a range of biological organisms. We introduce Learned Context Dependent Gating (LXDG), a method to flexibly allocate and recall `artificial neuronal ensembles', using a particular network structure and a new set of regularization terms. Activities in the hidden layers of the network are modulated by gates, which are dynamically produced during training. The gates are outputs of networks themselves, trained with a sigmoid output activation. The regularization terms we have introduced correspond to properties exhibited by biological neuronal ensembles. The first term penalizes low gate sparsity, ensuring that only a specified fraction of the network is used. The second term ensures that previously learned gates are recalled when the network is presented with input from previously learned tasks. Finally, there is a regularization term responsible for ensuring that new tasks are encoded in gates that are as orthogonal as possible from previously used ones. We demonstrate the ability of this method to alleviate catastrophic forgetting on continual learning benchmarks. When the new regularization terms are included in the model along with Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) it achieves better performance on the benchmark `permuted MNIST' than with EWC alone. The benchmark `rotated MNIST' demonstrates how similar tasks recruit similar neurons to the artificial neuronal ensemble.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Pretraining Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated State Space Models\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Jing Nathan Yan, Albert Gu, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. While other\narchitectures have been used, downstream accuracy is either significantly\nworse, or requires attention layers to match standard benchmarks such as GLUE.\nThis work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in\nsequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs). Our proposed model,\nBidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM layers with a multiplicative\ngating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling\narchitectures. The model learns static layers that do not consider pair-wise\ninteractions. Even so, BiGS is able to match BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE\nand can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without\napproximation.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

DenoMamba: A fused state-space model for low-dose CT denoising\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM gating mechanisms\"*\n\n*Tolga \u00c7ukur, O\u011fuz Can Duran, \u015eaban \u00d6zt\u00fcrk*\n\n**Abstract:** Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) lower potential risks linked to radiation exposure while relying on advanced denoising algorithms to maintain diagnostic quality in reconstructed images. The reigning paradigm in LDCT denoising is based on neural network models that learn data-driven image priors to separate noise evoked by dose reduction from underlying tissue signals. Naturally, the fidelity of these priors depend on the model's ability to capture the broad range of contextual features evident in CT images. Earlier convolutional neural networks (CNN) are highly adept at efficiently capturing short-range spatial context, but their limited receptive fields reduce sensitivity to interactions over longer distances. Although transformers based on self-attention mechanisms have recently been posed to increase sensitivity to long-range context, they can suffer from suboptimal performance and efficiency due to elevated model complexity, particularly for high-resolution CT images. For high-quality restoration of LDCT images, here we introduce DenoMamba, a novel denoising method based on state-space modeling (SSM), that efficiently captures short- and long-range context in medical images. Following an hourglass architecture with encoder-decoder stages, DenoMamba employs a spatial SSM module to encode spatial context and a novel channel SSM module equipped with a secondary gated convolution network to encode latent features of channel context at each stage. Feature maps from the two modules are then consolidated with low-level input features via a convolution fusion module (CFM). Comprehensive experiments on LDCT datasets with 25\\% and 10\\% dose reduction demonstrate that DenoMamba outperforms state-of-the-art denoisers with average improvements of 1.4dB PSNR, 1.1% SSIM, and 1.6% RMSE in recovered image quality.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and resources that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Gated State Space Models (SSMs)\n\n1. **Mamba and Longhorn Architectures:**\n   - The Mamba model by Gu and Dao (2023) and the Longhorn model by Liu et al. (2024) provide insights into how selective state space models can be integrated with gating mechanisms. These models demonstrate linear-time sequence modeling and improved performance on various tasks.\n   - **Key Insight:** The selective mechanism in Mamba and the implicit update in Longhorn can be adapted to enhance the RWKV architecture.\n\n2. **Gating Mechanisms in SSMs:**\n   - Research on integrating gating mechanisms like Gated Linear Units (GLUs) or SwiGLU into SSMs is crucial. GLUs have been shown to improve the model's capacity to capture complex dependencies (Dauphin et al., 2017).\n   - **Resource:** Look for papers or preprints that specifically discuss the integration of GLUs or similar gating mechanisms within SSMs. For example, a search on arXiv or academic databases using keywords like \"Gated State Space Models,\" \"SSM gating mechanisms,\" and \"Integrating GLU with SSM\" can yield relevant results.\n\n### Advanced Activation Functions\n\n1. **Beyond SwiGLU:**\n   - While SwiGLU has shown promise, exploring other advanced activation functions that could be used in conjunction with SSMs is important.\n   - **Resource:** Investigate recent papers on novel activation functions designed for deep learning models, especially those that have been applied to sequence modeling tasks. For instance, functions like GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit), ReLU, or more recent variants could be considered.\n\n### Implementation Strategies and Best Practices\n\n1. **Integration into RWKV:**\n   - To ensure seamless integration into the RWKV6FeedForward GAU, it is essential to study best practices for modifying existing architectures.\n   - **Resource:** Look for case studies or technical reports on how similar modifications have been implemented in other models. For example, the paper by Peng et al. (2023) on Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) models provides insights into combining RNN and Transformer characteristics, which can be useful for integrating SSMs.\n\n2. **Training Stability and Efficiency:**\n   - Ensuring that the modifications do not introduce significant computational overhead or training instability is critical.\n   - **Resource:** Research on efficient training techniques for large models, such as mixed precision training, gradient checkpointing, and other optimization methods, can be beneficial. Papers on the efficiency of SSMs and their implementation in deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can also provide practical insights.\n\n### Specific Resources and Literature\n\n1. **Recent Preprints and Papers:**\n   - Search for recent preprints on arXiv, especially those published in 2023 and 2024, that discuss advancements in SSMs, gating mechanisms, and novel activation functions.\n   - **Example Search Terms:** \"Gated State Space Models,\" \"State Space Models for Language Modeling,\" \"Advanced Activation Functions in Deep Learning,\" \"Efficient Sequence Modeling.\"\n\n2. **Conference Proceedings:**\n   - Proceedings from conferences like NIPS, ICLR, and EMNLP often feature cutting-edge research in deep learning and sequence modeling.\n   - **Example:** The paper by Peng et al. (2023) in the EMNLP proceedings is a good example of such research.\n\n3. **Open-Source Implementations:**\n   - Looking at open-source implementations of similar models on GitHub or other repositories can provide practical insights into how these models are implemented and optimized.\n   - **Example:** Repositories related to Mamba, Longhorn, or RWKV models can be particularly useful.\n\n### Example Search Queries\n\n- **Google Scholar:**\n  - \"Gated State Space Models for language modeling\"\n  - \"Integrating GLU with State Space Models\"\n  - \"Advanced activation functions in deep learning for sequence modeling\"\n  - \"Efficient training of large sequence models\"\n\n- **arXiv:**\n  - \"Gated State Space Models\"\n  - \"State Space Models with gating mechanisms\"\n  - \"Novel activation functions for deep learning\"\n\nBy focusing on these areas and resources, the researcher can gather the necessary information to design a novel autoregressive LM block that integrates the benefits of SSMs, gating mechanisms, and advanced activation functions, potentially outperforming current state-of-the-art models.\n",

The selective mechanism allows the model to focus on relevant information, similar to how GLUs regulate information flow.\n\n- **Relevance to RWKV Architecture:**\n\n  The **RWKV** model, which combines RNN and Transformer characteristics, could potentially benefit from incorporating SSM-inspired gating mechanisms in its feedforward units. This could enhance its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n- **Gated Activation Functions Enhance Expressiveness:**\n\n  Both GLUs and their variants, like **SwiGLU**, have been shown to improve model expressiveness by enabling element-wise gating. This allows the model to capture complex relationships and regulate the information passed through the network.\n\n- **Potential of Gated SSMs in Feedforward Layers:**\n\n  Incorporating a gated SSM approach into the **RWKV6FeedForward** unit could provide a hybrid mechanism that leverages the strengths of both SSMs and GLUs. This might involve designing a new feedforward unit that employs a state space representation with gating to enhance performance.\n\n- **Efficiency Considerations:**\n\n  SSMs like those used in Mamba maintain linear computational complexity and are designed for efficient sequence modeling. Integrating gating mechanisms into SSMs should be done carefully to ensure that the overall model remains efficient in both training and inference.\n\n**4. Future Search Plan**\n\nTo further refine the proposal and ensure its feasibility, the next steps include:\n\n- **Deep Dive into Gated State Space Models:**\n\n  - Investigate literature and designs that specifically discuss the integration of gating mechanisms within state space models, particularly for language modeling tasks.\n\n- **Explore Advanced Activation Functions Beyond SwiGLU:**\n\n  - Look into other activation functions that have been successfully used in conjunction with SSMs or in feedforward layers of language models.\n\n- **Implementation Strategies and Best Practices:**\n\n  - Research best practices for integrating gating mechanisms or SSMs into existing architectures like RWKV.\n  - Identify potential challenges in training stability, computational overhead, and hardware implications.\n\n- **Evaluate Compatibility with RWKV6FeedForward:**\n\n  - Analyze how the proposed modifications can be seamlessly integrated into the existing **RWKV6FeedForward** GAU.\n  - Ensure that the modifications align with the overall design principles and maintain the model's scalability and efficiency.\n\n**5.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2209.10655, 2022. [36] Eric Martin and Chris Cundy.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/28 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nwhere decoding every token requires attending to the whole past. The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 2.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Latent variable modeling has emerged as a\npromising approach to bridge this quality gap, particularly for addressing the\nchronic multimodality problem in NAT. In the previous works that used latent\nvariable modeling, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior\ndistribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target\nsentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant\ninformation extraction in the latent variable, increasing the number of\nparameters, and a tendency to ignore some information from the inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel latent variable modeling that integrates a dual\nreconstruction perspective and an advanced hierarchical latent modeling with a\nshared intermediate latent space across languages. This latent variable\nmodeling hypothetically alleviates or prevents the above disadvantages.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Gated State Space Models (GSSMs):**\n  - **Expressiveness and Adaptability:** GSSMs, as demonstrated in **Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces**, effectively enhance model expressiveness and adaptability through gating mechanisms. These mechanisms dynamically regulate information flow, which is crucial for capturing complex patterns and long-range dependencies in language tasks.\n  \n  - **Training Efficiency:** GSSMs can train faster than traditional SSM variants, maintaining or improving training efficiency without sacrificing performance. This aligns with the **R-SSMWKV** goal of maintaining computational efficiency.\n  \n- **RWKV Architecture Enhancements:**\n  - **RRWKV:** The **RRWKV** model integrates retrospective receptance into the RWKV6Attention unit, enhancing its ability to absorb long-range information. However, it focuses on the attention unit rather than the feedforward unit, which differentiates it from **R-SSMWKV**.\n  \n  - **Mamba:** **Mamba** achieves linear-time sequence modeling with selective state spaces and shows impressive performance across multiple modalities. However, it does not target feedforward units within the RWKV architecture, highlighting the novelty of **R-SSMWKV** in this aspect.\n  \n  - **xLSTM:** The **xLSTM** model introduces exponential gating and modified memory structures to enhance LSTM capabilities, making it competitive with Transformers and SSMs. This showcases the effectiveness of gating mechanisms in improving expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling.\n  \n- **Comparative Novelty:**\n  - The **R-SSMWKV** proposal's specific focus on integrating GSSMs into **RWKV6FeedForward** units appears to be unique. Existing models either enhance attention mechanisms or incorporate gating within state space models but do not directly modify feedforward units within the RWKV architecture.\n  \n  - External models like **Hyena** and **Mega** introduce innovative attention mechanisms with gating elements but do not address feedforward units within RWKV architectures, further supporting the proposal's novelty.\n  \n- **Performance Impact:**\n  - **Perplexity Reduction:** Integrating GSSMs is expected to lower perplexity scores by effectively modeling long-range dependencies, as demonstrated in similar integrations.\n  \n  - **Downstream Task Accuracy:** Enhanced expressiveness and dependency modeling should translate to higher accuracy in tasks like text classification and generation.\n  \n  - **Robustness Enhancement:** The dynamic gating mechanism can improve the model's ability to handle varied and noisy inputs, increasing robustness.\n  \n  - **Efficiency Gains:** Leveraging GSSMs while maintaining linear computational complexity ensures that efficiency is not compromised, aligning with RWKV's original design goals.\n  \n- **Implementation Feasibility:**\n  - **Architectural Alignment:** The RWKV architecture's linear complexity and recurrent-like operations provide a suitable foundation for integrating GSSMs without significant overhead.\n  \n  - **Parameter Management:** Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can manage the additional parameters introduced by GSSMs, ensuring that the model remains efficient.\n  \n  - **Training Stability:** Incorporating gating mechanisms requires careful handling of gradient flows to prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients. Strategies such as gradient clipping and proper initialization can mitigate these risks.\n  \n#### 4.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Gated State Space Models (GSSMs):**\n  - **Expressiveness and Adaptability:** GSSMs, as demonstrated in **Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces**, significantly enhance model expressiveness and adaptability. The gating mechanisms within GSSMs dynamically regulate information flow, allowing the model to capture complex and long-range dependencies efficiently.\n  \n  - **Training Efficiency:** GSSMs have been shown to train faster than traditional SSM variants like S4, aligning with the **R-SSMWKV** proposal's goal of maintaining computational efficiency. This is crucial for large-scale language models where training speed and resource utilization are paramount.\n  \n- **RWKV Architecture Enhancements:**\n  - **RRWKV:** The **RRWKV** model enhances the RWKV6Attention unit by incorporating a retrospective receptance mechanism, improving its ability to absorb long-range information while maintaining memory and computational efficiency. However, this focus on the attention unit distinguishes it from **R-SSMWKV**, which targets the feedforward unit.\n  \n  - **Mamba:** **Mamba** achieves linear-time sequence modeling with selective state spaces, offering high performance across multiple modalities. Its ability to scale efficiently without compromising performance provides valuable insights into maintaining efficiency when integrating additional mechanisms like GSSMs.\n  \n  - **xLSTM:** The **xLSTM** model introduces exponential gating and modified memory structures, enhancing LSTM capabilities to rival state-of-the-art Transformers and SSMs. This underscores the benefits of gating mechanisms in improving model expressiveness and long-range dependency handling.\n  \n- **Comparative Novelty:**\n  - The **R-SSMWKV** proposal's specific integration of GSSMs into **RWKV6FeedForward** units appears **novel**. While existing models have explored integrating SSMs and gating mechanisms into attention units or using selective state spaces, none have directly modified the feedforward units within the RWKV architecture to the extent proposed by **R-SSMWKV**.\n  \n  - External models like **Hyena** and **Mega** introduce innovative attention mechanisms with gating elements but do not address feedforward units within the RWKV architecture, further highlighting the uniqueness of **R-SSMWKV**.\n  \n- **Performance Impact:**\n  - **Perplexity Reduction:** The integration of GSSMs is expected to lower perplexity scores by effectively modeling long-range dependencies, as evidenced by similar integrations in related models.\n  \n  - **Downstream Task Accuracy:** Enhanced expressiveness and dependency modeling should translate to higher accuracy in tasks such as text classification, generation, and other NLP benchmarks.\n  \n  - **Robustness Enhancement:** The dynamic gating mechanism can improve the model's ability to handle varied and noisy inputs, increasing robustness.\n  \n  - **Efficiency Gains:** Leveraging GSSMs while maintaining linear computational complexity ensures that efficiency is not compromised, aligning with the RWKV architecture's original design principles.\n\n- **Implementation Feasibility:**\n  - **Architectural Alignment:** The RWKV architecture's linear computational complexity and recurrent-like operations provide a suitable foundation for integrating GSSMs without significant overhead.\n  \n  - **Parameter Management:** Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can manage the additional parameters introduced by GSSMs, ensuring that the model remains efficient and scalable.\n  \n  - **Training Stability:** Incorporating gating mechanisms requires careful handling of gradient flows to prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients. Strategies such as gradient clipping and proper initialization can mitigate these risks and ensure stable training.\n\n#### 4.

Historically, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been the natural choice for this task and led to early breakthroughs in the field. However, RNNs suffer from the vanishing and exploding gradient problem, often making them unstable to train on long sequences (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber (1997)). Gated variants such as LSTM and GRU were developed to address this issue but are still inherently inefficient to train due to their non-linear recurrent nature. Furthermore, their sequential nature leads to an inductive bias towards recent inputs, limiting their\npractical ability to draw long-range dependencies. This inspired the attention mechanism (Garg et al. (2019)), which was first introduced as an addition to RNN for language translation, allowing the model to draw pairwise global dependencies between input data points. Vaswani et al. (2023) took this further with Transformer, which completely gets rid of recurrence and just relies on attention. The main advantages of Transformers are their efficient parallelizable training on modern hardware and their ability to draw global pairwise dependencies. The latter property comes at the price of quadratic complexity $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ compared to the linear complexity $O(l)$ of RNNs. This poses a practical bottleneck for many applications, for instance limiting the document length a transformer based language model can perform reasoning on. Therefore, much effort has been put into finding attention replacements with improved complexity. While these variants such as Reformer, Linformer and Performer offer a reduced complexity of $O(l \\log l)$ or $O(l)$ the original transformer with only minor adjustments prevailed due to its stronger practical performance. Furthermore, the departure from recurrence eliminated the locality bias of the model to pay more attention the recent inputs. While the absence of this bias is advantageous for some tasks, it has proven to be disadvantageous for others. This led to a line of work dedicated to injecting locality bias into Transformer (Ma et al. (2023), Huang et al. (2023)). Meanwhile, the works of Gu et al. (2022) on the initialization of discretized State Space Models (SSMs) lead to a resurgence of linear RNNs for modeling long sequences. The most prominent model of this class S4 and its simplified diagonal variant S4D, achieve remarkable results on the long-range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al. (2020)), a benchmark designed to test a models ability to model long-range dependencies. SSMs can be trained efficiently by exploiting their linear and timeinvariant nature. By rewriting the linear recurrence as a long convolution, it can be computed through the Fourier domain in $O(l \\log l)$ time complexity. Smith et al. (2023b) introduced S5, which further simplifies the application of SSMs and popularized the use of associative scan implementations for fast parallelized training. Still, SSMs are heavily dependent on involved initialization schemes. Motivated by the question whether such tedious initialization is really necessary, Orvieto et al. (2023) developed the Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) which is on par with S4, S4D and S5 while only requiring much simpler initialization. ## Our contributions to this line of work are three-fold:\n\n- We show that existing models only utilize a special case of linear recurrence. Motivated by this observation, we develop GateLoop, a foundational sequence model that generalizes existing linear recurrent models by utilizing data-controlled gating of inputs, hidden states and outputs. GateLoop can be trained efficiently in $O(l \\log l)$ making use of highly optimized associative scan implementations. - Furthermore, we derive an equivalent $O\\left(l^{2}\\right)$ mode which links GateLoop to Transformer and prove that our approach can be interpreted as providing data-controlled relativepositional information to attention. - Finally, we demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, our results show that GateLoop outperforms the state of the art models Transformer, Hyena (Poli et al. (2023)) and S5-Hyena (Smith et al. (2023a)) on the WikiText103 benchmark for autoregressive language modeling. ## 2 PRELIMINARIES\n\nWe consider the task of approximating sequence-to-sequence mappings. The model takes a multichannel input sequence $x=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{l}\\right\\}$ packed as a matrix $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d_{x}}$ and outputs $Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{l \\times d_{y}}$. A common assumption in this context is causality, implying that for modeling $y_{n}$, only information from all $x_{m}$ with $m \\leq n$ may be used. This enables efficient training strategies such as autoregressive language modeling. ### 2.1 RECURRENT NEural NETWORK\n\nA Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) layer approximates a sequence-to-sequence mapping through the following recurrence relation involving learnable parameters $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h} \\times d_{h}}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{h} \\times d_{x}}, C \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{y} \\times d_{h}}$ and an activation function $\\sigma 1$\n\n$$\nh_{n}=\\sigma\\left(A h_{n-1}+B x_{n}\\right), \\quad y_{n}=C h_{n}\n$$\n\nCommon choices for $\\sigma$ are tanh or sigmoid. If we chose $\\sigma$ to be the identity function, the RNN layer becomes linear. ### 2.2 State Space ModeL\n\nThe continuous state space model (SSM) is characterized by the differential equation 2 Here, $\\tilde{A} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{h} \\times d_{h}}, \\tilde{B} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{h} \\times d_{x}}, \\tilde{C} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{d_{y} \\times d_{h}}$ are complex valued, the function $\\Re($.$) extracts the$ real part and $\\vec{h}(0)$ is defined to be 0 . $$\n\\frac{d \\tilde{h}(t)}{d t}=\\tilde{A} \\tilde{h}(t)+\\tilde{B} x(t), \\quad y(t)=\\Re(\\tilde{C} \\tilde{h}(t))\n$$\n\nMoreover, $\\tilde{A}$ can be diagonalized through its eigenvalue decomposition $\\tilde{A}=V \\Lambda V^{-1}$. In this representation, $\\Lambda$ is a diagonal matrix of eigenvalues, and $V$ is the matrix of corresponding eigenvectors. Now, by absorbing $V$ and $V^{-1}$ into $\\tilde{C}$ and $\\tilde{B}$, respectively, we obtain the diagonalized SSM. For more details on this procedure, please see Smith et al. (2023b). $$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\n\\bar{B}=V^{-1} \\tilde{B}, \\quad \\bar{C}=\\tilde{C} V, & \\bar{h}(t)=V^{-1} \\tilde{h}(t) \\\\\n\\frac{d \\bar{h}(t)}{d t}=\\Lambda \\bar{h}(t)+\\bar{B} x(t), & y(t)=\\Re(\\bar{C} \\bar{h}(t))\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nIn order to utilize the SSMs practically for sequence modeling, they can be discretized, e.g., through the zero-order hold $(\\mathrm{ZOH})$, bilinear, or Euler method. Given a fixed discretization step-size $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$, the ZOH method yields the linear recurrence relation\n\n$$\nh_{n}=A h_{n-1}+B x_{n}, \\quad y_{n}=\\Re\\left(C h_{n}\\right)\n$$\n\nwith the parameterization:\n\n$$\nA=\\exp (\\Delta \\Lambda), \\quad B=\\Lambda^{-1}(A-I) \\bar{B}, \\quad C=\\bar{C}\n$$\n\nDiscretizing the state space model (4) gives a linear RNN layer (1) involving special reparameterizations of its weights. While this result is simply the solution of the ZOH method application, it is worth paying attention to its interpretability. Specifically, consider the influence of the discretization step size:\n\n$$\n\\lim _{\\Delta \\rightarrow 0}(A, B)=(I, 0)\n$$\n\nIn the limit $\\Delta \\rightarrow 0$, no new information enters the state space model and the hidden state remains constant. A small $\\Delta$ leads to a sequence-to-sequence mapping with small rates of change, while a large $\\Delta$ leads to large rates of change. It becomes clear, that the step-size has vital impact on the model's retain/forget properties. For S5, Smith et al. (2023b) define $\\Delta$ as a learnable parameter vector, where the default values for initialization are logarithmically spaced from 0.001 up to 0.1 .\n```\n\n#### 2.

Finally, we show that leveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance of GSS even further. ## 1 Introduction\n\nModeling long range dependencies on sequential data is a crucial step towards closing the gap with human-level performance on many tasks. Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nwhere decoding every token requires attending to the whole past. The ideal model is parallelizable at training time but incurs a small constant cost (per decoded token) at inference time. This brings us to the final point. Due to the inherent convolution-recurrence equivalence of the state space model, it can be made to accumulate state and unroll like an RNN at inference time without any approximations. Despite these attractive properties, we found that current state space models (such as S4, DSS) run slower than we expected at training time on TPUs, our accelerator of choice. We take this opportunity to modify the architecture to reduce dimensionality of specific operations which we found to be bottlenecks. Our proposed changes borrow from a well-supported empirical observation around the effectiveness of gating units [Shazeer, 2020]. Specifically, Hua et al. [2022] observed that replacing the typical Feed-Forward layer in the Transformer with gating units allows for a reduced dimensionality when mixing tokens along the length dimension using self-attention. We extend the use of gating units to state space model family and observe that, even in our context, the use of gating units allows for a reduction in dimensionality when performing FFT operations, which we observed to be the main bottleneck behind slow training. Furthermore, somewhat contrary to observations made by S4 and DSS authors, we found the performance of the model on language modeling tasks to be much less sensitive to initialization. We found that only the scale and structural aspects of initialization of state space variables were important and not the exact values. We were able to successfully train the model while initializing the state space variables randomly. This departs significantly, at least in understanding, from the reliance of the design on the theory of HiPPO matrices, which led the S 4 model to employ several numerical linear algebra tricks to able to make it work. Combining both of these contributions, we propose a layer named Gated State Space (GSS) (Figure 1), which we empirically verified to be $2-3 \\times$ faster than DSS while keeping the perplexity on several language modeling benchmarks (Table 1). Going one step further, we also perform an apples-to-apples comparison with well-tuned and performant baselines reported in Block Recurrent Transformers [Hutchins et al., 2022], on several long range language modeling benchmarks over modalities such as English books, raw source code from Github and LaTeX source of ArXiv mathematics articles. As detailed in Table 2, while our GSS model currently lags behind on some tasks when compared in the fixed-parameter setting, it is fairly competitive in the fixed-compute setting where we measure compute as the exact amount of TPUv4 hours spent on a training run and serves as a fairly accurate proxy to the realistic cost of training that model. Furthermore, we also experimented with a hybrid model in which we sparingly interleave Transformer layers (having local attention) in a GSS stack to allow for a richer modeling of short range interactions. To our delight, this further improves performance at (roughly) no extra training cost, both in terms of parameters and compute. While in our experiments we train on sequences of length at most 4 k , we evaluated our GSS variants on a wide range of sequence lengths upto 65 k and found consistent generalization to longer inputs. Not only the performance doesn't degrade as the sequence length is increased but it gets significantly better, suggesting that GSS is effective at utilizing the extra context even though it was not trained with that much amount of context. At inference time, state space models including GSS are fairly efficient since decoding can happen in recurrent mode (as much as $60 \\times$ better in the case of $S 4$ [Gu et al., 2022a]). Though, the hybrid model which also uses local attention complicates this advantage a bit. In summary, we propose GSS, an alternative to $S 4$ and DSS which trains $2-3 \\times$ faster, is simple to implement and fairly competitive with well-tuned Transformer-based baselines on several long range language modeling benchmarks. ## 2 Related Work\n\nIn recent years, attention-based models have emerged as a dominant technique for sequence modeling, achieving remarkable improvements in a wide range of tasks, starting in NLP [Vaswani et al., 2017, Devlin et al., 2019, Radford et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019], then moving to other classical machine learning areas such as computer vision [Dosovitskiy et al., 2021] and now to the physical sciences [Avsec et al., 2021, Jumper et al., 2021].\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model for Realistic Image Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: Gated State Space Models RWKV6FeedForward Integration*\n\n*Zheng Chen, Yulun Zhang, Ding Liu, Bin Xia, Jinjin Gu, L. Kong, X. Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff) is proposed, which designs the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models (DMs) have recently been introduced in image deblurring and exhibited promising performance, particularly in terms of details reconstruction. However, the diffusion model requires a large number of inference iterations to recover the clean image from pure Gaussian noise, which consumes massive computational resources. Moreover, the distribution synthesized by the diffusion model is often misaligned with the target results, leading to restrictions in distortion-based metrics. To address the above issues, we propose the Hierarchical Integration Diffusion Model (HI-Diff), for realistic image deblurring. Specifically, we perform the DM in a highly compacted latent space to generate the prior feature for the deblurring process. The deblurring process is implemented by a regression-based method to obtain better distortion accuracy. Meanwhile, the highly compact latent space ensures the efficiency of the DM. Furthermore, we design the hierarchical integration module to fuse the prior into the regression-based model from multiple scales, enabling better generalization in complex blurry scenarios. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic and real-world blur datasets demonstrate that our HI-Diff outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This limits their ability to effectively solve tasks involving extended time gaps between actions and outcomes, or tasks demanding the recalling of distant observations to inform current actions. To improve temporal coherence, we integrate a new family of state space models (SSMs) in world models of MBRL agents to present a new method, Recall to Imagine (R2I). This integration aims to enhance both long-term memory and long-horizon credit assignment. Through a diverse set of illustrative tasks, we systematically demonstrate that R2I not only establishes a new state-of-the-art for challenging memory and credit assignment RL tasks, such as BSuite and POPGym, but also showcases superhuman performance in the complex memory domain of Memory Maze. At the same time, it upholds comparable performance in classic RL tasks, such as Atari and DMC, suggesting the generality of our method.

A state-space model for inferring effective connectivity of latent neural dynamics from simultaneous EEG/fMRI\n\n*From Search Query: Gated State Space Models RWKV6FeedForward Integration*\n\n*Tao Tu, J. Paisley, S. Haufe, P. Sajda*\n\n**TL;DR:** A linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data is developed and the results emphasize the importance of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI.\n\n**Abstract:** Inferring effective connectivity between spatially segregated brain regions is important for understanding human brain dynamics in health and disease. Non-invasive neuroimaging modalities, such as electroencephalography (EEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), are often used to make measurements and infer connectivity. However most studies do not consider integrating the two modalities even though each is an indirect measure of the latent neural dynamics and each has its own spatial and/or temporal limitations. In this study, we develop a linear state-space model to infer the effective connectivity in a distributed brain network based on simultaneously recorded EEG and fMRI data. Our method first identifies task-dependent and subject-dependent regions of interest (ROI) based on the analysis of fMRI data. Directed influences between the latent neural states at these ROIs are then modeled as a multivariate autogressive (MVAR) process driven by various exogenous inputs. The latent neural dynamics give rise to the observed scalp EEG measurements via a biophysically informed linear EEG forward model. We use a mean-field variational Bayesian approach to infer the posterior distribution of latent states and model parameters. The performance of the model was evaluated on two sets of simulations. Our results emphasize the importance of obtaining accurate spatial localization of ROIs from fMRI. Finally, we applied the model to simultaneously recorded EEG-fMRI data from 10 subjects during a Face-Car-House visual categorization task and compared the change in connectivity induced by different stimulus categories.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating a Gated State Space Model (GSSM) into the RWKV6FeedForward architecture, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n### Effectiveness of GSSM Integration\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs):** SSMs are known for their ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.

Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 59/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n- RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is another recent RNN designed for language modeling. It is based on AFT (attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021)), another variant of linear attention. Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be seen as the ratio of two SSMs. We also highlight the gated attention unit (GAU) from Hua et al. (2022), which was motivated by combining the Transformer's MHA and MLP blocks together and was an inspiration for our architecture (Section 3.4) combining the H3 and MLP blocks. ## B. 3 Relationship to RNNs\n\nRNNs and SSMs are broadly related, as they both involve the concepts of recurrence on a latent state. Several older RNNs such as the strongly typed RNN (Balduzzi and Ghifary 2016), quasi-RNN (QRNN) (Bradbury et al. 2016), and simple recurrent unit (SRU) (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017) involve forms of gated RNNs without time-wise nonlinearities. Because of the connections of gating mechanisms and selection mechanisms, these can be viewed as cases of selective SSMs, and are thus more powerful in a sense than the family of LTI structured SSMs above. The main differences are:\n\n- They do not use state expansion $(N=1)$ or selective $B, C$ parameters, both of which are important for performance (Section 4.6). - They use a heuristic gating mechanism, which we generalize as a consequence of the selection mechanism + discretization (Theorem 1). The connections to principled SSM theory provides better parameterizations and initializations (Section 3.6). Additionally, older RNNs famously suffered from efficiency issues and the vanishing gradients problem (Hochreiter 1991; Hochreiter, Bengio, et al. 2001; Pascanu, Mikolov, and Bengio 2013), both caused by their sequential nature. The former could be solved for some of the above RNNs by leveraging the parallel scan (Martin and Cundy 2018), but the latter was difficult without theory later developed for SSMs. For example, modern structured SSMs differ in more careful parameterization of the recurrent dynamics inspired by classical SSM theory (e.g.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Gated State Space Models\" \"RWKV architecture\" \"Feedforward unit integration\", \"Gated State Space Models\" \"RWKV6FeedForward\" \"Autoregressive Language Models\", \"Gated State Space Models\" \"RWKV6FeedForward\" \"Autoregressive Language Models Integrations\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Neumann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new deep approach to Kalman filtering which can be learned directly in an end-to-end manner using backpropagation without additional approximations and uses a high-dimensional factorized latent state representation for which the Kalman updates simplify to scalar operations and thus avoids hard to backpropagate, computationally heavy and potentially unstable matrix inversions.\n\n**Abstract:** In order to integrate uncertainty estimates into deep time-series modelling, Kalman Filters (KFs) (Kalman et al., 1960) have been integrated with deep learning models, however, such approaches typically rely on approximate inference tech- niques such as variational inference which makes learning more complex and often less scalable due to approximation errors. We propose a new deep approach to Kalman filtering which can be learned directly in an end-to-end manner using backpropagation without additional approximations. Our approach uses a high-dimensional factorized latent state representation for which the Kalman updates simplify to scalar operations and thus avoids hard to backpropagate, computationally heavy and potentially unstable matrix inversions. Moreover, we use locally linear dynamic models to efficiently propagate the latent state to the next time step. The resulting network architecture, which we call Recurrent Kalman Network (RKN), can be used for any time-series data, similar to a LSTM (Hochreiter & Schmidhuber, 1997) but uses an explicit representation of uncertainty. As shown by our experiments, the RKN obtains much more accurate uncertainty estimates than an LSTM or Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) (Cho et al., 2014) while also showing a slightly improved prediction performance and outperforms various recent generative models on an image imputation task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 2.

However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 209  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3.

However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

However, their original\nformulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched\ntransformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to\naddress these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating\narchitectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data\nand compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is\nlimited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a\ncost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose\nScalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA).

Autoregressive Text Generation Beyond Feedback Loops\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated State Space Models\" \"RWKV6FeedForward\" \"Autoregressive Language Models\"*\n\n*Florian Schmidt, Stephan Mandt, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive state transitions, where predictions are conditioned on past\npredictions, are the predominant choice for both deterministic and stochastic\nsequential models. However, autoregressive feedback exposes the evolution of\nthe hidden state trajectory to potential biases from well-known train-test\ndiscrepancies. In this paper, we combine a latent state space model with a CRF\nobservation model. We argue that such autoregressive observation models form an\ninteresting middle ground that expresses local correlations on the word level\nbut keeps the state evolution non-autoregressive. On unconditional sentence\ngeneration we show performance improvements compared to RNN and GAN baselines\nwhile avoiding some prototypical failure modes of autoregressive models.\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-30T11:31:07Z  (*Updated: 2019-08-30T11:31:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Shared Latent Space by Both Languages in Non-Autoregressive Neural\n  Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Gated State Space Models\" \"RWKV6FeedForward\" \"Autoregressive Language Models Integrations\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) offers substantial\ntranslation speed up compared to autoregressive neural machine translation (AT)\nat the cost of translation quality. Latent variable modeling has emerged as a\npromising approach to bridge this quality gap, particularly for addressing the\nchronic multimodality problem in NAT. In the previous works that used latent\nvariable modeling, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior\ndistribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target\nsentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant\ninformation extraction in the latent variable, increasing the number of\nparameters, and a tendency to ignore some information from the inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel latent variable modeling that integrates a dual\nreconstruction perspective and an advanced hierarchical latent modeling with a\nshared intermediate latent space across languages. This latent variable\nmodeling hypothetically alleviates or prevents the above disadvantages. In our\nexperiment results, we present comprehensive demonstrations that our proposed\napproach infers superior latent variables which lead better translation\nquality. Finally, in the benchmark translation tasks, such as WMT, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves translation quality\ncompared to previous NAT baselines including the state-of-the-art NAT model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02T15:33:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-09T01:44:27Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, specifically the **R-SSMWKV** proposal, which integrates **Gated State Space Models (GSSMs)** into the **RWKV6FeedForward** architecture, here are the key insights and useful information gathered from the provided references and analysis:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n#### Gated State Space Models (GSSMs)\n- **Expressiveness and Adaptability**: GSSMs incorporate gating mechanisms that dynamically regulate information flow, enhancing model expressiveness and adaptability to complex patterns. This is highlighted in the work by Mehta et al. (2022), where the Gated State Space (GSS) layer trains significantly faster than the diagonal version of S4 and is competitive with Transformer-based baselines.\n\n#### Long-Range Dependency Modeling\n- GSSMs can significantly improve the model\u2019s ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently. The GSS layer exhibits zero-shot generalization to longer inputs, which is crucial for language modeling tasks.\n\n#### RWKV Architecture\n- **Efficiency**: The RWKV architecture combines aspects of RNNs and Transformers, maintaining linear computational complexity while capturing dependencies across sequences. Integrating GSSMs into this architecture could further enhance its dependency modeling capabilities without compromising efficiency.\n\n#### Parameter Management and Efficiency\n- Techniques like Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) can be used to mitigate increases in parameter count and maintain efficiency. For example, applying LoRA to linear projection matrices in SSMs achieves superior performance on several metrics, indicating its potential for parameter-efficient fine-tuning.\n\n#### Training Stability\n- Incorporating gated mechanisms may introduce challenges in gradient flow, necessitating strategies like gradient clipping or careful initialization. The stability of training GSSM-integrated models needs to be carefully evaluated.\n\n### Useful References and Information\n\n#### Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\n- This work by Mehta et al. (2022) is highly relevant as it proposes the GSS layer, which trains faster than the diagonal version of S4 and is competitive with Transformer-based baselines. It also shows zero-shot generalization to longer inputs, making it a strong foundation for the **R-SSMWKV** proposal.\n\n#### Fully Data-Controlled Linear Recurrence for Sequence Modeling\n- The GateLoop model by Katsch (2023) generalizes linear recurrent models by employing data-controlled state transitions and outperforms existing models for autoregressive language modeling. This provides insights into how data-controlled transitions can be integrated into state space models.\n\n#### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of State Space Models\n- The paper on LoRA applied to SSMs highlights the effectiveness of fine-tuning linear projection matrices, which can be crucial for maintaining efficiency in the **R-SSMWKV** model. It also notes that LoRA might not be well-suited for tuning SSM modules directly, suggesting a need for careful parameter management.\n\n#### Selective State Space Models (S6)\n- The S6 model proposed by Gu & Dao (2024) introduces input-dependent parameters to state space models, which can selectively extract relevant information from the context. This approach could be integrated into the **R-SSMWKV** proposal to enhance its context-dependent modeling capabilities.\n\n### Future Search and Analysis Plan\n\n#### External Searches\n- Use refined keywords such as \"Gated State Space Models,\" \"RWKV6FeedForward,\" and \"Autoregressive Language Models Integrations\" to identify recent studies or models that have attempted similar integrations.\n\n#### Internal Library Searches\n- Utilize detailed descriptions to locate any internal papers or designs that have explored the integration of GSSMs into RWKV6FeedForward or similar feedforward units within autoregressive language models.\n\n#### Benchmark Analysis\n- Identify benchmark studies comparing SSM-based models like S4 and DSS with Transformer-based models on language modeling tasks to gauge expected performance impacts. This includes evaluating metrics such as perplexity, accuracy, and computational efficiency.\n\n#### Implementation Case Studies\n- Review implementation strategies from models like GateLoop and GSS to derive practical guidelines for integrating GSSMs into RWKV architectures without compromising computational efficiency.\n\n#### Scalability and Robustness Evaluation\n- Examine studies that assess the scalability and robustness of GSSM-integrated models in diverse and challenging language tasks to inform expectations for the **R-SSMWKV** proposal.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive insights to ensure the novelty, feasibility, and potential impact of the **R-SSMWKV** proposal.\n",

Attention based models like Transformer [Vaswani et al., 2017] have proven to be a strong choice of backbone architecture for a considerable number of tasks across modalities and scale [Devlin et al., 2019, Brown et al., 2020, Dosovitskiy et al., 2021]. Vanilla Multi-Head-Attention famously incurs $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ penalty in modeling a sequence of length $L$. This is prohibitive at best for tasks where the model is required to capture long range dependencies from various parts of the input. Over the years, a variety of improvements have been proposed to alleviate this quadratic complexity (cf. [Tay et al., 2020]). On a somewhat orthogonal direction, attention-free models based on state spaces, such as $\\mathrm{S} 4[\\mathrm{Gu}$ et al., 2022a] and DSS [Gupta et al., 2022], have shown remarkable improvements on Long Range Arena (LRA) [Tay et al., 2021], a benchmark designed with long range modeling as its focus and consists of diverse tasks with $1 \\mathrm{k}-16 \\mathrm{k}$ sequence length across modalities. These models require careful initialization, originally borrowing ideas from the theory of HiPPO matrices [Voelker et al., 2019, Gu et al., 2020], to achieve good results on LRA. In this work, we explore and extend the use of state space models by focusing solely on the task of autoregressive sequence modeling [Brown et al., 2020, Rae et al., 2021, Chowdhery et al., 2022, Zhang et al., 2022, Hoffmann et al., 2022, Srivastava et al., 2022]. Several key properties endowed by the state space model family makes it particularly attractive, to at least fully explore it, in the context of language modeling. First, it reduces the $\\Omega\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ complexity on input sequence length to $O(L \\log L)$. This complexity results from the use of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) [Cooley and Tukey, 1965] for performing convolutions. We will describe this in detail in later sections. Second, the state space model is fully parallelizable in the length dimension. This is an arguably subtle but an important property at training time. Note that transformers are also fully parallelizable, a worthy advantage over traditional RNNs for modeling sequences, which otherwise incurs only an $O(L)$ penalty. While this parallelism is useful at training time, it may also be a curse at inference time\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5ab9ed67021bd72a4442g-02.jpg?height=470&width=563&top_left_y=242&top_left_x=369)\n\n```\ndef gss(x, F=4096, L=4096, \\(E=1024, \\mathrm{H}=256\\) ):\n    shortcut, \\(\\mathrm{x}=\\mathrm{x}, \\operatorname{norm}(\\mathrm{x})\\)\n    \\(\\mathrm{v}=\\) dense(x, F, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{u}=\\) dense(x, H, activation='gelu')\n    \\(\\mathrm{y}=\\operatorname{dss}(u, \\mathrm{H}, \\mathrm{L})\\)\n    \\# yh1,..,yhL are linear in uh1,..,uhL\n    \\(\\mathrm{uc}=\\) dense(y, F)\n    \\(0=\\) dense(uc \\(*\\) v, E)\n    return o + shortcut\n```\n\nFigure 1: (a) Our proposed Gated State Space (GSS) layer, (b) Pseudocode for GSS (full implementation in \u00a7A.2).\n```\n\n#### 2. xLSTM: Extended Long Short-Term Memory (Avg.

Since then, LSTMs have stood the test of time and contributed to numerous deep learning success stories, in particular they constituted the first Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the advent of the Transformer technology with parallelizable self-attention at its core marked the dawn of a new era, outpacing LSTMs at scale. We now raise a simple question: How far do we get in language modeling when scaling LSTMs to billions of parameters, leveraging the latest techniques from modern LLMs, but mitigating known limitations of LSTMs? Firstly, we introduce exponential gating with appropriate normalization and stabilization techniques. Secondly, we modify the LSTM memory structure, obtaining: (i) sLSTM with a scalar memory, a scalar update, and new memory mixing, (ii) mLSTM that is fully parallelizable with a matrix memory and a covariance update rule. Integrating these LSTM extensions into residual block backbones yields xLSTM blocks that are then residually stacked into xLSTM architectures. Exponential gating and modified memory structures boost xLSTM capabilities to perform favorably when compared to state-of-the-art Transformers and State Space Models, both in performance and scaling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 43/97 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, 2312.10523, 2023.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 5. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 45/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn: The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). 2017.

Latent variable modeling has emerged as a\npromising approach to bridge this quality gap, particularly for addressing the\nchronic multimodality problem in NAT. In the previous works that used latent\nvariable modeling, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior\ndistribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target\nsentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant\ninformation extraction in the latent variable, increasing the number of\nparameters, and a tendency to ignore some information from the inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel latent variable modeling that integrates a dual\nreconstruction perspective and an advanced hierarchical latent modeling with a\nshared intermediate latent space across languages.

First, we propose an autoregressive\nforward-backward pre-training phase before NAT training, which enables the NAT\ndecoder to gradually learn bidirectional target dependencies for the final NAT\ntraining. Second, we transform the decoder input from the source language\nrepresentation space to the target language representation space through a\nnovel attentive transformation process, which enables the decoder to better\ncapture target dependencies. DePA can be applied to any fully NAT models.\nExtensive experiments show that DePA consistently improves highly competitive\nand state-of-the-art fully NAT models on widely used WMT and IWSLT benchmarks\nby up to 1.88 BLEU gain, while maintaining the inference latency comparable to\nother fully NAT models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30T12:53:20Z  (*Updated: 2023-08-02T06:13:35Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating **Gated State Space Models (GSSMs)** into the **RWKV6FeedForward** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) and enhancing its performance, here are some key insights and recommendations based on the provided references and analysis:\n\n### Key Insights\n\n#### Gated State Space Models (GSSMs)\n- **GSSMs** have been shown to enhance expressiveness and long-range dependency modeling.

Summary of Analysis\n\nThe **R-SSMWKV** proposal aims to enhance the **RWKV6FeedForward** Generalized Autoregressive Unit (GAU) by integrating a **Gated State Space Model (GSSM)**. This integration is intended to improve the model's capacity to capture long-range dependencies, enhance expressiveness, and maintain computational efficiency in language modeling tasks. Initial and subsequent searches have revealed several relevant studies that explore the integration of GSSMs and gating mechanisms into sequence modeling architectures, particularly within the context of language models.\n\nKey insights from the gathered references indicate that while GSSMs have been effectively integrated into various architectures to enhance long-range dependency modeling, the specific integration within the RWKV6FeedForward unit remains relatively unexplored. Notably, models like **GateLoop**, **RRWKV**, and **Mamba** demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of combining gating mechanisms with state space models. However, none of these directly replicate the proposed **R-SSMWKV** integration, suggesting a degree of novelty. Additionally, external models like **Hyena** and **Mega** introduce innovative attention mechanisms that share conceptual similarities with the proposed modifications but do not directly address the RWKV architecture.\n\n#### 2.

However, it specifically enhances the **RWKV6Attention** unit rather than the feedforward unit.\n  - **Mamba:** **Mamba** introduces selective state spaces, offering linear-time sequence modeling without attention or MLP blocks.

While Transformers have excelled in capturing such dependencies, they suffer from quadratic computational complexity with respect to sequence length, leading to inefficiencies in training and inference. The RWKV architecture combines aspects of RNNs and Transformers to enable efficient sequence modeling with linear complexity. However, there is potential to further enhance its ability to capture complex patterns over long sequences.\n\nWe aim to improve the RWKV6 model by integrating a Gated State Space Model (GSSM) into the RWKV6FeedForward unit. This integration enhances the model's capacity to model long-range dependencies while maintaining computational efficiency, ultimately leading to better perplexity scores, higher accuracy on downstream tasks, and improved robustness to varied inputs.\n\n## Related Work\n\n- **Gated State Space Models (GSSMs):** Mehta et al. (2022) introduced the GSS layer, demonstrating its effectiveness in modeling long-range dependencies in language tasks while maintaining efficient training and inference.\n\n- **Mamba Architecture:** Gu and Dao (2023) proposed Mamba, which integrates selective SSMs into a simplified neural network without attention mechanisms, achieving state-of-the-art performance across various modalities.\n\n- **Bidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS):** Wang et al. (2023) combined SSM layers with a multiplicative gating architecture, matching BERT's performance on GLUE benchmarks.\n\n- **Gated Activation Functions:** Dauphin et al. (2017) and Shazeer (2020) demonstrated the effectiveness of gated linear units (GLUs) and their variants (e.g., SwiGLU) in enhancing model expressiveness and performance.\n\nThese works highlight the benefits of integrating gating mechanisms and state space models to improve sequence modeling efficiency and performance.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n**Key Concept:** Integrate a Gated State Space Model into the RWKV6FeedForward GAU to enhance long-range dependency modeling, improve expressiveness, and maintain computational efficiency.\n\n**Why GSSM?**\n\n- **Long-Range Dependencies:** GSSMs are designed to efficiently capture long-range dependencies through state space representations.\n\n- **Gating Mechanisms:** Gating allows dynamic regulation of information flow, enabling the model to focus on relevant features and suppress irrelevant ones.\n\n- **Compatibility:** The recurrent nature of GSSMs complements the RWKV architecture's time-shifted operations, facilitating seamless integration.\n\n**Mathematical Justification:**\n\n1. **State Space Model Equations:**\n\n   The continuous-time state space model is defined as:\n\n   \\[\n   \\frac{d\\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{h}(t) + \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{u}(t)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y}(t) = \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}(t) + \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{u}(t)\n   \\]\n\n   Discretizing with step size \\(\\Delta t = 1\\) (assuming unit time steps):\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{A}_d \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}_d \\mathbf{u}_t\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{C}_d \\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{D}_d \\mathbf{u}_t\n   \\]\n\n2. **Gating Mechanism:**\n\n   Incorporating gating to control information flow:\n\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g \\mathbf{x}_t + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\mathbf{o}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\mathbf{y}_t + (1 -

Implement a GSSM within RWKV6FeedForward to handle the transformation and gating of inputs.\n\n2. **Architectural Adjustments:**\n\n   - **Input Projections:**\n\n     Compute two linear projections of the input:\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{U} = \\mathbf{W}_u \\mathbf{X} + \\mathbf{b}_u\n     \\]\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{V} = \\mathbf{W}_v \\mathbf{X} + \\mathbf{b}_v\n     \\]\n\n   - **State Update:**\n\n     For each time step \\(t\\):\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{h}_t = \\mathbf{A}_d \\mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \\mathbf{B}_d \\mathbf{U}_t\n     \\]\n\n   - **Output Computation:**\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{y}_t = \\mathbf{C}_d \\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{D}_d \\mathbf{U}_t\n     \\]\n\n   - **Gating Mechanism:**\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{g}_t = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_g \\mathbf{X}_t + \\mathbf{b}_g)\n     \\]\n\n   - **Final Output:**\n\n     \\[\n     \\mathbf{O}_t = \\mathbf{g}_t \\odot \\mathbf{y}_t + (1 - \\mathbf{g}_t) \\odot \\mathbf{X}_t\n     \\]\n\n3. **Parameter Definitions:**\n\n   - \\(\\mathbf{A}_d, \\mathbf{B}_d, \\mathbf{C}_d, \\mathbf{D}_d\\): Discretized state space matrices (learnable parameters).\n   - \\(\\mathbf{W}_u, \\mathbf{W}_v, \\mathbf{W}_g\\): Weight matrices for input projections and gating.\n   - \\(\\mathbf{b}_u, \\mathbf{b}_v, \\mathbf{b}_g\\): Bias vectors.\n\n4. **Integration with Time-Shift Operations:**\n\n   - Ensure the state update aligns with RWKV's time-shifted operations by appropriately handling the hidden state \\(\\mathbf{h}_t\\).\n\n### Theoretical Justifications:\n\n- **Enhanced Expressiveness:** The GSSM captures temporal dependencies through its state \\(\\mathbf{h}_t\\), enabling the model to remember previous information over long sequences.\n\n- **Dynamic Control:** The gating mechanism allows the model to adaptively control the influence of the state and input, improving the ability to focus on important information.\n\n- **Computational Efficiency:** By structuring the computations appropriately, we can leverage parallelization and maintain linear computational complexity.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified GAU\n\n```python\nclass RWKV6GSSMFeedForward(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n\n        self.hidden_size = embed_dim\n        self.state_dim = kwargs.get('state_dim', embed_dim)\n        self.output_dim = embed_dim\n\n        # Input projections\n        self.W_u = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.state_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        self.W_v = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.state_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n        # State space parameters\n        self.A_d = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.state_dim, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.B_d = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.state_dim, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.C_d = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.state_dim, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n        self.D_d = nn.Parameter(torch.randn(self.state_dim, self.state_dim, **self.factory_kwargs))\n\n        # Gating mechanism\n        self.W_g = nn.Linear(self.hidden_size, self.output_dim, bias=True, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        # X: [batch_size, seq_len, hidden_size]\n        batch_size, seq_len, _ = X.size()\n        U = self.W_u(X)  # [batch_size, seq_len, state_dim]\n        V = self.W_v(X)  # [batch_size, seq_len, state_dim]\n        g = torch.sigmoid(self.W_g(X))  # [batch_size, seq_len, output_dim]\n\n        # Initialize hidden state h_0\n        h_t = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.state_dim, device=X.device, dtype=X.dtype)\n\n        outputs = []\n        for t in range(seq_len):\n            U_t = U[:, t, :]  # [batch_size, state_dim]\n            V_t = V[:, t, :]  # [batch_size, state_dim]\n            X_t = X[:, t, :]  # [batch_size, hidden_size]\n            g_t = g[:, t, :]  # [batch_size, output_dim]\n\n            # State Update: h_t = A_d * h_{t-1} + B_d * U_t\n            h_t = torch.matmul(h_t, self.A_d.T) + torch.matmul(U_t, self.B_d.T)\n\n            # Output: y_t = C_d * h_t + D_d * U_t\n            y_t = torch.matmul(h_t, self.C_d.T) + torch.matmul(U_t, self.D_d.T)\n\n            # Final Output with Gate: O_t = g_t * y_t + (1 -
