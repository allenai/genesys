Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n#### 3. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.87)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In our large-scale experiments, Transformer-VQ is shown highly competitive in quality, obtaining 0.99 bpb on Enwik8, 26.6 ppl on PG-19, and 3.16 bpb on ImageNet64. In addition, the optimized implementation of Transformer-VQ is over 3x faster than a comparable quadratic-time transformer at sequence length 8k, is over 12x faster at 32k, and can scale to 131k with similar throughput.

(2019), codebooks are parameterized using EMA-smoothed k-means. ### 3.4.2 TRAINING UPDATES\n\nInstead of updating on the full sequence loss given above, we generally update every $W / L$ query blocks, where $W \\ll T$, which resembles a strategy used in prior works Dai et al., 2019, Wu et al., 2022, Hutchins et al. 2022). Each update is obtained by backpropagating through a window of $W$ timesteps, with gradients computed on the corresponding terms in the per-token average losses above. Codebooks are also updated every $W / L$ query blocks. When $W / L=1$, using Theorem 3.7 is an efficient equivalent to a variable-length key-value cache. When $W / L>1$, a learning signal is sent through any value vectors added to the compressed cache within the backpropagation window. ## 4 RELATED WORK\n\n### 4.1 Hierarchical AtTENTION\n\nCombiner Ren et al. 2021) proposes an approximation of softmax using a simple graphical model, and parameterizes its internal probabilities using max-pooling over query/key features, enabling decoder-only self-attention in subquadratic time. H-Transformer-1D (Zhu \\& Soricut, 2021) uses average-pooling operations over queries/keys to reduce the complexity of encoder-only self-attention. Transformer-LS (Zhu et al. 2021) uses dynamic projections to downsample long-range features in transformers by a user-specified factor. Hourglass Transformer (Nawrot et al. 2021) and MegaByte (Yu et al. 2023) eschew pooling in favor of convolutions or reshaping for temporal downsampling, and apply these techniques to reduce computation in the interior layers of decoder-only transformers. Transformer-VQ differs from these works in that it uses vector quantization (VQ), a well-understood method for compression, instead of newly-designed heuristic methods. In addition, it does not rely on token contiguity to guide the compression process. Instead, it utilizes an equivalence to dense attention. Notably, Transformer-VQ is easier to sample from compared to previous hierarchical attention models; since the cache update logic can be equivalently applied every token instead of every $L$ tokens, there are no sporadic 'feature consolidation' operations required during sampling. ### 4.2 KERNELIZABLE ATTENTION\n\nKernelizable attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020, Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) computes query and key features and applies the same nonlinearity to both of them separately, omitting additional nonlinearities when computing attention weights. By using the associativity of matrix multiplication, kernelized attention reduces attention to linear complexity. Transformer-VQ is distinguished from kernelizable attention through an asymmetric treatment of queries and keys, a deterministic equivalence to softmax-based attention, training stability, and strong quantitative results on long-context autoregressive modeling benchmarks. Clustering attention (Vyas et al. 2020) uses vector-quantized queries and is also kernelizable. However, it requires learning per-layer codebooks for each sequence and uses a modified form of Lloyd's iterations based on Hamming distance and locality-sensitive hashing. This yields a complex non-causal algorithm which is only suitable for non-causal attention and is slow on TPUs. Transformer-VQ is strongly differentiated from clustering attention by its simplicity, applicability to decoder-only tasks, efficiency on TPUs, and large-scale experimental validation. ### 4.3 COMPRESSIVE ATTENTION\n\nCompressive Transformers (Rae et al. 2020) directly learn a compression function for long-range features. LUNA (Ma et al., 2021) and Recurrent Transformers (Bulatov et al., 2022, Hutchins et al., 2022) use cross-attention to compress long-range features into a recurrent state. Notably, our model implements a kind of block-recurrent mechanism for its cache, but is significantly more parameter-efficient than the mechanisms proposed by Ma et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded.

This paper explores word taxonomies as means for constructing new\nsemantic features, which may improve the performance and robustness of the\nlearned classifiers. We propose tax2vec, a parallel algorithm for constructing\ntaxonomy-based features, and demonstrate its use on six short text\nclassification problems: prediction of gender, personality type, age, news\ntopics, drug side effects and drug effectiveness. The constructed semantic\nfeatures, in combination with fast linear classifiers, tested against strong\nbaselines such as hierarchical attention neural networks, achieves comparable\nclassification results on short text documents. The algorithm's performance is\nalso tested in a few-shot learning setting, indicating that the inclusion of\nsemantic features can improve the performance in data-scarce situations.

ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory compression attention transformer*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Conglong Li, Xiaoxia Wu, Minjia Zhang, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Attentional Hybrid Neural Networks for Document Classification\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention neural networks*\n\n*Cleber Zanchettin, David Mac\u00eado, Luis Fred, Jader Abreu*\n\n**Abstract:** Document classification is a challenging task with important applications. The deep learning approaches to the problem have gained much attention recently. Despite the progress, the proposed models do not incorporate the knowledge of the document structure in the architecture efficiently and not take into account the contexting importance of words and sentences. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on a combination of convolutional neural networks, gated recurrent units, and attention mechanisms for document classification tasks. The main contribution of this work is the use of convolution layers to extract more meaningful, generalizable and abstract features by the hierarchical representation. The proposed method in this paper improves the results of the current attention-based approaches for document classification.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Document-Level Neural Machine Translation with Hierarchical Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention neural networks*\n\n*Nikolaos Pappas, James Henderson, Lesly Miculicich, Dhananjay Ram*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Machine Translation (NMT) can be improved by including document-level\ncontextual information. For this purpose, we propose a hierarchical attention\nmodel to capture the context in a structured and dynamic manner. The model is\nintegrated in the original NMT architecture as another level of abstraction,\nconditioning on the NMT model's own previous hidden states. Experiments show\nthat hierarchical attention significantly improves the BLEU score over a strong\nNMT baseline with the state-of-the-art in context-aware methods, and that both\nthe encoder and decoder benefit from context in complementary ways.\n\n**Conference:** document-level-neural-machine-translation-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. MADTP: Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning for Accelerating Vision-Language Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic pruning transformer*\n\n*Tao Chen, Jiwen Lu, Yansong Tang, Chong Yu, Shengze Li, Peng Ye, JianJian Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-Language Transformers (VLTs) have shown great success recently, but are meanwhile accompanied by heavy computation costs, where a major reason can be attributed to the large number of visual and language tokens. Existing token pruning research for compressing VLTs mainly follows a single-modality-based scheme yet ignores the critical role of aligning different modalities for guiding the token pruning process, causing the important tokens for one modality to be falsely pruned in another modality branch. Meanwhile, existing VLT pruning works also lack the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer based on different input samples. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning (MADTP) for accelerating various VLTs. Specifically, we first introduce a well-designed Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module that can align features of the same semantic concept from different modalities, to ensure the pruned tokens are less important for all modalities. We further design a novel Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module, which can adaptively adjust the token compression ratio in each layer based on different input instances. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that MADTP significantly reduces the computational complexity of kinds of multimodal models while preserving competitive performance. Notably, when applied to the BLIP model in the NLVR2 dataset, MADTP can reduce the GFLOPs by 80% with less than 4% performance degradation.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdapterDrop: On the Efficiency of Adapters in Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic pruning transformer*\n\n*Iryna Gurevych, Nils Reimers, Jonas Pfeiffer, Tilman Beck, Max Glockner, Gregor Geigle, Andreas R\u00fcckl\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Massively pre-trained transformer models are computationally expensive to fine-tune, slow for inference, and have large storage requirements. Recent approaches tackle these shortcomings by training smaller models, dynamically reducing the model size, and by training light-weight adapters. In this paper, we propose AdapterDrop, removing adapters from lower transformer layers during training and inference, which incorporates concepts from all three directions. We show that AdapterDrop can dynamically reduce the computational overhead when performing inference over multiple tasks simultaneously, with minimal decrease in task performances. We further prune adapters from AdapterFusion, which improves the inference efficiency while maintaining the task performances entirely.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory compression, hierarchical attention mechanisms, dynamic pruning, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques in Transformer Architectures\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nThe NAMMs framework introduces a novel way to manage the memory (KV cache) of transformers. It involves conditioning the memory on features constructed from the attention matrix, allowing for efficient management of the KV cache. This approach reduces the number of retained tokens, leading to efficiency benefits without compromising performance. NAMMs can be trained on top of pre-trained models and transferred to other transformers, including those with different architectures and input modalities.\n\n### KV-Compress\nKV-Compress is a technique that compresses the KV cache by applying variable compression rates per attention head. It exploits the heterogeneity of attention heads, applying higher compression to less important heads and lower compression to more important ones. Additionally, it uses paging to divide the cache into smaller chunks that can be loaded and unloaded from memory as needed, reducing the memory footprint significantly without compromising performance.\n\n## Implementation Approaches for Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Binary Partitioning (BP-Transformer)\nThe BP-Transformer uses a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism via binary partitioning, which allows for controlling the density of attention connections. This approach scales logarithmically with the sequence length, making it more efficient for capturing long-range dependencies [Analysis Note].\n\n### Multi-Scale Attention\nIncorporating multi-scale attention mechanisms, such as those in the BP-Transformer, can help capture both local and global dependencies. This hierarchical structure enables more efficient information processing and storage, which is crucial for handling long sequences [Analysis Note].\n\n## Methods for Dynamic Pruning in Attention Computations\n\n### Dynamic Pruning with KV-Compress\nWhile KV-Compress primarily focuses on compression, its variable compression rates per attention head can be seen as a form of dynamic pruning. It dynamically adjusts the compression based on the importance of each attention head, effectively pruning less important computations.\n\n### Adaptive Optimization and Pruning\nUsing adaptive optimization algorithms, such as AdamW, can help in dynamically adjusting the learning rate and potentially pruning redundant parameters. However, specific dynamic pruning strategies for attention mechanisms would involve identifying and removing less important attention heads or connections during training or inference.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly accelerate transformer self-attention computations. This hardware implementation leverages memristor crossbars to perform matrix multiplications, reducing power consumption and latency. For example, it achieves a 10x acceleration compared to digital counterparts and maintains low power consumption.\n\n### Model Parallelism and OpenVINO\nModel parallelism techniques distribute model components across multiple devices, reducing memory requirements and improving computational speed. Tools like OpenVINO can optimize sparse and quantized models, enabling significant performance improvements on specific hardware configurations, such as 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable Processors. This includes features like weight compression/decompression and sparsity support, which can be particularly beneficial for attention-based models.\n\n### Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Memory Compression**: Techniques like NAMMs and KV-Compress offer efficient ways to manage and compress the KV cache, reducing memory footprint without compromising performance.\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: Implementations such as BP-Transformer and multi-scale attention mechanisms can capture hierarchical structures efficiently, improving the handling of long sequences.\n- **Dynamic Pruning**: Dynamic pruning can be achieved through variable compression rates (KV-Compress) and adaptive optimization algorithms, helping to eliminate redundant computations.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Memristor-based accelerators and model parallelism with tools like OpenVINO can significantly improve the performance and efficiency of attention-based models on specific hardware configurations.\n\nThese insights and techniques can help researchers design more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 3. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 5. Nystr\u00f6mformer: A nystr\u00f6m-based algorithm for approximating self-attention (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Yunyang Xiong, Zhanpeng Zeng, Rudrasis Chakraborty, Mingxing Tan, G. Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms transformer*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms transformer*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: training stability compression*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

High Fidelity Neural Audio Compression\n\n*From Search Query: training stability compression*\n\n*Yossi Adi, Gabriel Synnaeve, Jade Copet, Alexandre D\u00e9fossez*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a state-of-the-art real-time, high-fidelity, audio codec leveraging neural networks. It consists in a streaming encoder-decoder architecture with quantized latent space trained in an end-to-end fashion. We simplify and speed-up the training by using a single multiscale spectrogram adversary that efficiently reduces artifacts and produce high-quality samples. We introduce a novel loss balancer mechanism to stabilize training: the weight of a loss now defines the fraction of the overall gradient it should represent, thus decoupling the choice of this hyper-parameter from the typical scale of the loss. Finally, we study how lightweight Transformer models can be used to further compress the obtained representation by up to 40%, while staying faster than real time. We provide a detailed description of the key design choices of the proposed model including: training objective, architectural changes and a study of various perceptual loss functions. We present an extensive subjective evaluation (MUSHRA tests) together with an ablation study for a range of bandwidths and audio domains, including speech, noisy-reverberant speech, and music. Our approach is superior to the baselines methods across all evaluated settings, considering both 24 kHz monophonic and 48 kHz stereophonic audio.

Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice recognition, and machine vision.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural networks*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model, particularly focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, training stability, compression, and hardware optimization, here are some detailed insights and recent advancements:\n\n## Recent Efficient Attention Variants and Their Implementations\n\n### Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe DAAM, as proposed in the recent research, integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism. This allows for dynamic adjustment of attention, enhancing the model's adaptability to non-stationary data. DAAM uses additive and multiplicative Gaussian parameters to adjust the attention distribution, providing both broad and focused attention as needed. This approach has shown significant improvements, especially with highly non-stationary data, and can be integrated with existing attention mechanisms like Multi-Head Attention (MHA).\n\n### Linear-Time Attention Variants\nLinear-time attention mechanisms, such as those enabled by vector quantization, have been shown to reduce the computational complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n)\\). For example, Transformer-VQ uses vector-quantized keys and a novel caching mechanism, making it over 3x faster than comparable quadratic-time transformers at long sequence lengths.\n\n### Hierarchical/Multi-Scale Attention\nHierarchical attention mechanisms can capture dependencies at different scales, reducing the computational burden. This approach involves using multiple layers of attention with varying context sizes, allowing the model to focus on different aspects of the input sequence efficiently.\n\n## Training Stability Techniques for Compressed Representations\n\n### Dynamic Context Pruning\nDynamic context pruning involves dynamically pruning contextual information during inference while preserving the model's expressiveness. This approach can reduce memory and computational requirements without significant performance degradation. It is crucial to balance compression and expressiveness to maintain training stability.\n\n### Regularization and Dropout\nUsing regularization techniques and dropout can help stabilize training when working with compressed representations. These methods prevent overfitting and ensure that the model generalizes well even with reduced parameters and context size.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies for Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Parallelization and GPU Optimization\nTransformers benefit significantly from parallelization due to their feedforward network architecture. Optimizing self-attention mechanisms for GPU acceleration is key. Techniques like decomposable attention and using high-throughput storage systems can enhance training and inference efficiency.\n\n### Memory-Bounded Algorithms\nImplementing memory-bounded algorithms can help optimize the memory usage during training and inference. This includes using constant memory attention algorithms and hierarchical memory structures to manage large sequence lengths efficiently.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Optimizations\nHardware-aware optimizations involve designing models that are aware of the underlying hardware constraints. For example, using byte-level deduplication and S3-compatible APIs can optimize storage and data access, reducing bottlenecks during training and inference.\n\n## Methods for Combining Multiple Efficiency Techniques\n\n### Integration of Linear-Time Attention and Dynamic Pruning\nCombining linear-time attention mechanisms with dynamic context pruning can significantly reduce both computational and memory requirements. This integration ensures that the model maintains its expressiveness while being highly efficient.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention with Compression\nUsing hierarchical attention mechanisms in conjunction with compression techniques like vector quantization can capture dependencies at multiple scales efficiently. This approach balances the need for detailed context with the need for computational efficiency.\n\n### Hardware-Aware Training Pipelines\nDesigning training pipelines that are hardware-aware, incorporating tools for data preprocessing, tokenization, and model training, can ensure seamless integration and optimal performance. This includes using Kubernetes-native designs and high-throughput storage systems.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of computation and memory but also robust, scalable, and highly performant.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.39)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.26)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Kersting, Taiji Suzuki, Brian Hie, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R'e, Ce Zhang, Stefano Massaroli*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning architectures is a resource-demanding process, due to a vast design space, long prototyping times, and high compute costs associated with at-scale model training and evaluation. We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

MOSS: Enabling Code-Driven Evolution and Context Management for AI\n  Agents\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic context management*\n\n*Ming Zhu, Yi Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Developing AI agents powered by large language models (LLMs) faces\nsignificant challenges in achieving true Turing completeness and adaptive,\ncode-driven evolution.

MAX-AST: COMBINING CONVOLUTION, LOCAL AND GLOBAL SELF-ATTENTIONS FOR AUDIO EVENT CLASSIFICATION\n\n*From Search Query: local global attention combination*\n\n*Philip JB Jackson, Muhammad Awais, Armin Mustafa, Sara Ahmed, Tony Alex*\n\n**Abstract:** In the domain of audio transformer architectures, prior research\r\nhas extensively investigated isotropic architectures that capture the\r\nglobal context through full self-attention and hierarchical architectures that progressively transition from local to global context utilising hierarchical structures with convolutions or window-based attention.

MemGPT: Towards LLMs as Operating Systems\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic context management*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Kevin Lin, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Sarah Wooders, Shishir G. Patil, Vivian Fang, Charles Packer*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI, but are constrained by limited context windows, hindering their utility in tasks like extended conversations and document analysis. To enable using context beyond limited context windows, we propose virtual context management, a technique drawing inspiration from hierarchical memory systems in traditional operating systems that provide the appearance of large memory resources through data movement between fast and slow memory. Using this technique, we introduce MemGPT (Memory-GPT), a system that intelligently manages different memory tiers in order to effectively provide extended context within the LLM's limited context window, and utilizes interrupts to manage control flow between itself and the user. We evaluate our OS-inspired design in two domains where the limited context windows of modern LLMs severely handicaps their performance: document analysis, where MemGPT is able to analyze large documents that far exceed the underlying LLM's context window, and multi-session chat, where MemGPT can create conversational agents that remember, reflect, and evolve dynamically through long-term interactions with their users.

HaGRID - HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic context management*\n\n*Andrei Makhliarchuk, Roman Kraynov, Alexander Nagaev, Karina Kvanchiani, Alexander Kapitanov*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces an enormous dataset, HaGRID (HAnd Gesture Recognition Image Dataset), to build a hand gesture recognition (HGR) system concentrating on interaction with devices to manage them. That is why all 18 chosen gestures are endowed with the semiotic function and can be interpreted as a specific action. Although the gestures are static, they were picked up, especially for the ability to design several dynamic gestures. It allows the trained model to recognize not only static gestures such as \"like\" and \"stop\" but also \"swipes\" and \"drag and drop\" dynamic gestures. The HaGRID contains 554,800 images and bounding box annotations with gesture labels to solve hand detection and gesture classification tasks. The low variability in context and subjects of other datasets was the reason for creating the dataset without such limitations. Utilizing crowdsourcing platforms allowed us to collect samples recorded by 37,583 subjects in at least as many scenes with subject-to-camera distances from 0.5 to 4 meters in various natural light conditions. The influence of the diversity characteristics was assessed in ablation study experiments. Also, we demonstrate the HaGRID ability to be used for pretraining models in HGR tasks.

Hardware-efficient entangled measurements for variational quantum algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Variational algorithms have received significant attention in recent years due to their potential to solve practical problems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A fundamental step of these algorithms is the evaluation of the expected value of Hamiltonians, and hence efficient schemes to perform this task are required. The standard approach employs local measurements of Pauli operators and requires a large number of circuits. An alternative is to make use of entangled measurements, which might introduce additional gates between physically disconnected qubits that harm the performance. As a solution to this problem, we propose hardware-efficient entangled measurements (HEEM), that is, measurements that permit only entanglement between physically connected qubits. We show that this strategy enhances the evaluation of molecular Hamiltonians in NISQ devices by reducing the number of circuits required without increasing their depth. We provide quantitative metrics of how this approach offers better results than local measurements and arbitrarily entangled measurements. We estimate the ground-state energy of the H$_2$O molecule with classical simulators and quantum hardware using the variational quantum eigensolver with HEEM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 6. HELP: Hardware-Adaptive Efficient Latency Prediction for NAS via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Song Chong, Sewoong Lee, Hayeon Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

Each head can focus on different aspects of the input, capturing both local and global contextual information.\n\n### Local and Global Mixture Networks\nThe concept of local and global mixture networks, similar to those used in image inpainting, can be adapted for language models. For instance, a model can use a combination of local attention mechanisms (like Neighborhood Attention) for capturing nearby contextual information and global attention mechanisms (like traditional self-attention) for long-range dependencies.\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\nThe GLE-Net approach, which combines CNNs and Transformers, can be a inspiration. Here, the Swin-Transformer captures global contextual information, while the Multi-scale Feature-extraction Module (MFM) captures local features across varying scales. This hybrid approach ensures that both local and global features are integrated effectively.\n\n## Dynamic Context Management Techniques in Transformers\n\n### Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe DAAM, introduced in the context of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, dynamically adjusts the attention focus using learnable mean and variance parameters. This mechanism allows the model to adapt to different input distributions, ensuring that the attention is both broadly and focusedly distributed as needed. This dynamic adjustment can enhance the model's ability to manage context effectively.\n\n### Adaptive Expert Allocation\nModels like AdaMV-MoE use adaptive expert allocation, where the number of activated experts is determined based on the training dynamics. This approach can be extended to dynamic context management by allocating different attention mechanisms or experts based on the context of the input sequence.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Hybrid Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Tiling Techniques\nLightning Attention-2 uses tiling techniques to handle intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculations, which is highly efficient for GPU hardware. This approach can be applied to hybrid attention mechanisms to reduce computational complexity and improve hardware efficiency.\n\n### Chunk-Based Processing\nChunk-based processing, as mentioned in the analysis, allows for better memory utilization. By processing the input sequence in chunks, the model can efficiently manage memory and reduce the computational overhead associated with large sequences.\n\n### Sliding Window Patterns\nNeighborhood Attention Transformer uses sliding-window patterns to localize self-attention, achieving linear time and space complexity. This method can be integrated into hybrid attention mechanisms to ensure efficient receptive field growth and reduce computational costs.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Multiple Attention Types\n\n### Grouped Query Attention (GQA)\nThe GQA mechanism serves as an intermediary between Multi-Head Attention (MHA) and Multi-Query Attention (MQA), balancing computational efficiency and the model's capacity to learn complex relationships. This can be used to integrate different attention types, such as local and global attention, within a single framework.\n\n### Hierarchical Learning Structures\nModels like FactSeg and PSPNet use hierarchical learning structures with multi-scale feature fusion. This approach can be adapted to integrate multiple attention mechanisms, ensuring that both local and global features are captured and fused effectively at different scales.\n\n### Adaptive Mechanisms\nIntegrating adaptive mechanisms, such as those in AdaMV-MoE, can help in dynamically selecting the most appropriate attention mechanism based on the input context. This ensures that the model can adapt to different scenarios and optimize resource usage efficiently.\n\nBy combining these techniques, researchers can design autoregressive language models that efficiently manage local and global attention, dynamically adapt to context, and are optimized for hardware efficiency.\n",

Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/12 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2019, equation 4). Unfortunately their paper went in a different direction and did not discuss the memory complexity implications and other innovations we present in the remainder of this paper. For more details see Section 6\nThis can be computed with constant memory: The memory overhead of this algorithm consists of a vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and a scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$, both initialized with 0 . Given the query $q$, keys $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and values $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, we process the keys and values in sequence. Given a key value pair $k_{i}$, $v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*}+e^{s_{i}}$. After processing all keys and values, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. The analysis of space complexity assumes that inputs are given in a particular order: we first read the query, and then a list of pairs of keys and values. If the inputs are provided in a different order, we have to additionally store an index into the sequence, requiring $O(\\log n)$ memory instead. To extend this algorithm to self-attention, we compute the results to all queries sequentially. This requires just one additional index into the list of queries, giving rise to the $O(\\log n)$ memory complexity. Note that the operation produces outputs that are linear in the size of the number of queries, i.e., $O(n)$, which is not counted towards the space complexity. ## 3 Numerical Stability\n\nThe formulation of standard attention that we presented in the Introduction, as well as our memory-efficient algorithm, are not numerically stable when using floating point arithmetic, because the softmax exponentiates the scores. For scores $\\geq 89$ the exponentiation results in inf (for bfloat16 and float32), which will be carried through to the final result of the attention operation. In practice, the softmax is implemented by subtracting the maximum score from all scores. This does not change the result of the softmax, but avoids this numerical problem. Our incremental computation of the sum of exponentiated scores (and the values times the scores) does not immediately allow for the same trick, as the maximum may depend on the last score in the sequence. But the subtraction cannot be delayed either, since the scores must be exponentiated before they can be added to the cumulative sum. To resolve this problem, we introduce an additional scalar, which keeps track of the maximum score that the incremental algorithm has seen so far, and we renormalize the sums of exponentiated values as needed: We initialize the vector $v^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and scalar $s^{*} \\in \\mathbb{R}$ with 0 , and $m^{*}$ with -inf. As before, given a key value pair $k_{i}, v_{i}$, we compute $s_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right)$, but then the algorithm differs slightly from Section 2. We first compute $m_{i}=\\max \\left(m^{*}, s_{i}\\right)$ and update $v^{*} \\leftarrow v^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+v_{i} e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $s^{*} \\leftarrow s^{*} e^{m^{*}-m_{i}}+e^{s_{i}-m_{i}}$ and $m^{*} \\leftarrow m_{i}$. After processing all keys and queries, we divide $\\frac{v^{*}}{s^{*}}$ to get the final result. ## 4 An Implementation For TPUs\n\nIn this section, we provide a version of the algorithm above that exploits the massive parallelism of modern hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs. The naive algorithm above is is not trivial to parallelize for a compiler, as the incremental sum introduces a dependency across all keys and values. We present the entire implementation, including the support for multiple attention heads and memory-efficient differentiation in Figure 1 The implementation does not optimize strictly for memory efficiency, but instead aims to strike a balance between simplicity, computational efficiency, and memory requirements. ```\nimport functools, jax, math\nfrom jax import numpy as jnp\ndef _query_chunk_attention(query, key, value, precision, key_chunk_size=4096):\n    \"\"\"Multi-head dot product attention with a limited number of queries.\"\"\"\n    num_kv, num_heads, k_features = key.shape\n    v_features = value.shape[-1]\n    key_chunk_size = min(key_chunk_size, num_kv)\n    query = query / jnp.sqrt(k_features)\n    @functools.partial(jax.checkpoint, prevent_cse=False)\n    def summarize_chunk(query, key, value):\n        attn_weights = jnp.einsum('qhd,khd->qhk', query, key, precision=precision)\n        max_score = jnp.max(attn_weights, axis=-1, keepdims=True)\n        max_score = jax.lax.stop_gradient(max_score)\n        exp_weights = jnp.exp(attn_weights - max_score)\n        exp_values = jnp.einsum('vhf,qhv->qhf', value, exp_weights, precision=precision)\n        return (exp_values, exp_weights.sum(axis=-1),\n            max_score.reshape((query.shape[0], num_heads)))\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx):\n        key_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            key, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, k_features))\n        value_chunk = jax.lax.dynamic_slice(\n            value, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(key_chunk_size, num_heads, v_features))\n        return summarize_chunk(query, key_chunk, value_chunk)\n    chunk_values, chunk_weights, chunk_max = jax.lax.map(\n        chunk_scanner, xs=jnp.arange(0, num_kv, key_chunk_size))\n    global_max = jnp.max(chunk_max, axis=0, keepdims=True)\n    max_diffs = jnp.exp(chunk_max - global_max)\n    chunk_values *= jnp.expand_dims(max_diffs, axis=-1)\n    chunk_weights *= max_diffs\n    all_values = chunk_values.sum(axis=0)\n    all_weights = jnp.expand_dims(chunk_weights, -1).sum(axis=0)\n    return all_values / all_weights\ndef attention(query, key, value, precision=jax.lax.Precision.HIGHEST,\n                query_chunk_size=1024):\n    \"\"\"Memory-efficient multi-head dot product attention.\"\"\"\n    num_q, num_heads, q_features = query.shape\n    def chunk_scanner(chunk_idx, _):\n        query_chunk = lax.dynamic_slice(\n            query, (chunk_idx, 0, 0),\n            slice_sizes=(min(query_chunk_size, num_q), num_heads, q_features))\n        return (chunk_idx + query_chunk_size,\n                _query_chunk_attention(query_chunk, key, value, precision=precision))\n    _, res = jax.lax.scan(\n        chunk_scanner, init=0, xs=None, length=math.ceil(num_q / query_chunk_size))\n    return res.reshape(num_q, num_heads, value.shape[-1])\n```\n\nFigure 1: Implementation of memory-efficient attention suited for TPUs.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.15)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 5. Generating Long Sequences with Sparse Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*R. Child, S. Gray, Alec Radford, I. Sutskever*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2019)\t**Cited by** 1488  (*Influential: 137*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n)$, and generates unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and shows it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are powerful sequence models, but require time and memory that grows quadratically with the sequence length. In this paper we introduce sparse factorizations of the attention matrix which reduce this to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$. We also introduce a) a variation on architecture and initialization to train deeper networks, b) the recomputation of attention matrices to save memory, and c) fast attention kernels for training. We call networks with these changes Sparse Transformers, and show they can model sequences tens of thousands of timesteps long using hundreds of layers. We use the same architecture to model images, audio, and text from raw bytes, setting a new state of the art for density modeling of Enwik8, CIFAR-10, and ImageNet-64. We generate unconditional samples that demonstrate global coherence and great diversity, and show it is possible in principle to use self-attention to model sequences of length one million or more.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/19 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nFor text and audio, we used two-dimensional attention embeddings, where $d_{\\text {attn }}=2$ and the index corresponds to each position's row and column index in a matrix of width equal to the stride. ### 5.4. Saving memory by recomputing attention weights\n\nGradient checkpointing has been shown to be effective in reducing the memory requirements of training deep neural networks (Chen et al., 2016), (Gruslys et al., 2016). It is worth noting, however, that this technique is particularly effective for self-attention layers when long sequences are processed, as memory usage is high for these layers relative to the cost of computing them. Using recomputation alone, we are able to train dense attention networks with hundreds of layers on sequence lengths of 16,384 , which would be infeasible on modern hardware otherwise. In our experiments, we recompute the attention and feedforward blocks during the backwards pass. To simplify our implementation, we do not apply dropout within the attention blocks, as in (Vaswani et al., 2017), and instead only apply it at the end of each residual addition, as seen in Figure 4. ### 5.5. Efficient block-sparse attention kernels\n\nThe sparse attention masks in 3(b) and 3(c) can be efficiently computed by slicing out sub-blocks from the query, key, and value matrices and computing the product in blocks. Attention over a local window can be computed as-is, whereas attention with a stride of $k$ can be computed by transposing the matrix and computing a local window. Fixed attention positions can be aggregated and computed in blocks. In order to ease experimentation, we implemented a set of GPU kernels which efficiently perform these operations. The softmax operation is fused into a single kernel and also uses registers to eliminate loading the input data more than once, allowing it to run at the same speed as a simple nonlinearity. The upper triangle of the attention matrix is never computed, moreover, removing the need for the negative bias term of (Vaswani et al., 2017) and halving the number of operations to be performed. ### 5.6. Mixed-precision training\n\nWe store network weights in single-precision floating-point, but otherwise compute network activations and gradients in half-precision, as in (Micikevicius et al., 2017). This accelerates our training due to the usage of Tensor Core operations on the V100 GPU. During the gradient calculation, we use\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_befcc9f073998d256dabg-07.jpg?height=985&width=1706&top_left_y=207&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 5.

We are able to learn long-range dependencies directly from pixels without using a multi-scale architecture. dynamic loss scaling to reduce numerical underflow, and we communicate half-precision gradients when averaging across multiple GPUs. When sampling, we cast the queries and keys to single-precision, as the query-key product can sometimes overflow the max value of half-precision. ## 6. Training\n\nWe use the Adam optimizer with a linear warmup of 5000 iterations and a gradient clipping of 1.0 , both of which we found important for model stability. We use a weight decay penalty of 0.01 . We annealed the learning rate according to a cosine decay as in (Radford et al., 2018). We train on 8 V100 GPUs unless otherwise noted. All embeddings are of a constant dimension $d$, usually one of $\\{256,512,1024\\}$. By default, all linear transforms are to the same dimension, with the exception of the feed-forward network, which projects the input to $4 d$, unless we use \"half-size\" transformations, where it is $2 d$. Additionally, sometimes we halve the size of the query and key transformations. We initialize the token embedding $W_{e}$ from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right)$ and the position embeddings from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d n_{\\text {emb }}}}\\right)$. Within the attention and feedforward components, all biases are initial- ized to 0 and all weights are initialized from $\\mathcal{N}\\left(0, \\frac{0.125}{\\sqrt{d_{i n}}}\\right)$ where $d_{i n}$ is the fan-in dimension.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 6 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory efficient attention transformer, training stability hybrid attention, hardware optimization neural network\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. EfficientViT: Memory Efficient Vision Transformer with Cascaded Group Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention transformer*\n\n*Yixuan Yuan, Han Hu, Yuqing Yang, Ningxin Zheng, Houwen Peng, Xinyu Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformers have shown great success due to their high model capabilities. However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

Memory-efficient Transformers via Top-k Attention\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention transformer*\n\n*Jonathan Berant, David Ciprut, Shaya Goodman, Guy Dar, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of dot-product attention in Transformers, numerous approximations have been recently proposed to address its quadratic complexity with respect to the input length. While these variants are memory and compute efficient, it is not possible to directly use them with popular pre-trained language models trained using vanilla attention, without an expensive corrective pre-training stage. In this work, we propose a simple yet highly accurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks, and for each query, compute the top-*k* scores with respect to the keys. Our approach offers several advantages: (a) its memory usage is linear in the input size, similar to linear attention variants, such as Performer and RFA (b) it is a drop-in replacement for vanilla attention that does not require any corrective pre-training, and (c) it can also lead to significant memory savings in the feed-forward layers after casting them into the familiar query-key-value framework. We evaluate the quality of top-*k* approximation for multi-head attention layers on the Long Range Arena Benchmark, and for feed-forward layers of T5 and UnifiedQA on multiple QA datasets. We show our approach leads to accuracy that is nearly-identical to vanilla attention in multiple setups including training from scratch, fine-tuning, and zero-shot inference.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-sustainlp-2021-11\n\n**Published:** None\n\n\n\n#### 3. AFS: An Attention-based mechanism for Supervised Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hybrid attention*\n\n*Danni Ge, Ning Gui, Ziyin Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its\neffectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks.\nThe proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has\nbrought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy\ndata, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel\nneural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based\nFeature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention\nmodule for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem\nmodeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features\nand supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a\nshallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on\nthe distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by\nbackpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows\nexisting off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less\ntraining time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A\nhybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection\naccuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation.\nExperimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in\ncomparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both\nMNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-28\n\n\n\n#### 4. Minimum Latency Deep Online Video Stabilization\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hybrid attention*\n\n*Bing Zeng, Ping Tan, Shuaicheng Liu, Zhen Liu, Zhuofan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel camera path optimization framework for the task of online video stabilization. Typically, a stabilization pipeline consists of three steps: motion estimating, path smoothing, and novel view rendering. Most previous methods concentrate on motion estimation, proposing various global or local motion models. In contrast, path optimization receives relatively less attention, especially in the important online setting, where no future frames are available. In this work, we adopt recent off-the-shelf high-quality deep motion models for motion estimation to recover the camera trajectory and focus on the latter two steps. Our network takes a short 2D camera path in a sliding window as input and outputs the stabilizing warp field of the last frame in the window, which warps the coming frame to its stabilized position. A hybrid loss is well-defined to constrain the spatial and temporal consistency. In addition, we build a motion dataset that contains stable and unstable motion pairs for the training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art online methods both qualitatively and quantitatively and achieves comparable performance to offline methods.

Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural network*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms. Our optimization sequence is generic and can be applied to any state-of-the-art models trained for anomaly detection, predictive maintenance, robotics, voice recognition, and machine vision.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization neural network*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on memory-efficient attention mechanisms, training stability for hybrid attention models, hardware-specific optimization strategies, and methods for combining multiple efficiency techniques, here are some detailed insights and strategies:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms and Their Implementations\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nNAMMs introduce a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. These models are conditioned on features constructed from the attention matrix, making them universally applicable to any transformer-based architecture. NAMMs can reduce the model's input contexts significantly while improving performance across multiple long-context benchmarks.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Bidirectional Transformers\nThese models utilize parallel layer execution, inspired by architectures like PaLM, which reduces training time by approximately 15%. They also omit biases in QKV projections and LayerNorms, optimizing resource utilization. Additionally, techniques like virtual context management and hierarchical memory systems, similar to those in MemGPT, can intelligently manage different memory tiers, extending context handling efficiently.\n\n### Hybrid Local-Global Attention\nModels like MAX-AST and QANet combine convolution for local interactions and self-attention for global interactions. This hybrid approach balances local and global processing, leading to significant speed improvements in both training and inference. Such multi-component attention integration excels in efficiency compared to prior methods[Analysis Note].\n\n## Training Stability Techniques for Hybrid Attention Models\n\n### Normalization Techniques\nRecent normalization techniques, such as those proposed by Gilmer et al., have proven effective in stabilizing the training process of hybrid attention models. Normalizing queries and keys helps in maintaining training stability, which is crucial for scaling these models.\n\n### Dynamic Context Management\nDynamic context management, as seen in NAMMs, allows for the provision of distinct contexts to each latent level independently. This approach enables individual layers and attention heads to focus on the most relevant information, enhancing training stability and performance.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies for Attention Computations\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nUsing memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer self-attention computations. This approach integrates computation into memory, reducing power consumption and latency. For example, a memristor crossbar array performs matrix operations in an analog method, which is more efficient than traditional digital implementations.\n\n### Tiling and Block-Based Processing\nOptimizing for GPU performance using tiling and block-based processing is crucial. This strategy, along with memory hierarchy awareness, can significantly enhance the efficiency of attention computations. Hardware-adaptive approaches, such as those in HELP, can also meta-learn device-dependent latency predictors to optimize performance[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hardware-Aware Attention Patterns\nDesigning attention patterns that are aware of hardware constraints can further optimize performance. For instance, using backward attention memory models (BAM) with a counter-causal mask can introduce a purposeful asymmetric relationship, distinguishing between older and newer tokens, which can be more efficient in hardware implementations.\n\n## Methods for Combining Multiple Efficiency Techniques\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Systems and Dynamic Pruning\nCombining hierarchical memory systems with dynamic pruning strategies can effectively manage memory usage. Models like MemGPT draw inspiration from traditional operating systems to manage different memory tiers, extending context handling efficiently. Dynamic pruning can further reduce memory usage by selectively retaining the most relevant tokens[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hybrid Attention Mechanisms with Hardware Optimization\nIntegrating hybrid attention mechanisms (local-global attention) with hardware-specific optimizations (like memristor-based acceleration or tiling/block-based processing) can provide a balanced approach. This combination ensures both high performance and efficiency, leveraging the strengths of each technique[Analysis Note].\n\n### Meta-Learning for Hardware Adaptation\nUsing meta-learning to adapt to different hardware environments, as in HELP, can help in optimizing the model's efficiency across various devices. This approach allows the model to learn device-dependent latency predictors, ensuring optimal performance on different hardware setups[Analysis Note].\n\nBy combining these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only highly efficient in terms of memory and computation but also scalable and robust, leading to better overall performance.\n",

However, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Transformer-based LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023, Anil et al., 2023; Groeneveld et al. 2024) have a constrained context-dependent memory, due to the nature of the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism in Transformers exhibits quadratic complexity in both memory footprint and computation time. For example, the attention Key-Value (KV) states have 3TB memory footprint for a 500B model with batch size 512 and context length 2048 (Pope et al. 2023). Indeed, scaling LLMs to longer sequences (i.e. 1 M tokens) is challenging with the standard Transformer architectures and serving longer and longer context models becomes costly financially. Compressive memory systems promise to be more scalable and efficient than the attention mechanism for extremely long sequences (Kanerva, 1988; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Instead of using an array that grows with the input sequence length, a compressive memory primarily maintains a fixed number of parameters to store and recall information with a bounded storage and computation costs. In the compressive memory, new information is added to the memory by changing its parameters with an objective that this information can be recovered back later on. However, the LLMs in their current state have yet to see an effective, practical compressive memory technique that balances simplicity along with quality. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enables Transformer LLMs to effectively process infinitely long inputs with bounded memory footprint and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention (Figure 1). The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014, Vaswani et al. 2017) and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. Such a subtle but critical modification to the Transformer attention layer enables a natural extension of existing LLMs to infinitely long contexts via continual pre-training and finetuning. Our Infini-attention reuses all the key, value and query states of the standard attention computation for long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. We store old KV states of the attention in the compressive memory, instead of discarding them like in the standard attention mechanism. We then retrieve the values from the memory by using the attention query states when processing subsequent sequences. To compute the final contextual output, the Infini-attention aggregates the long-term memory-retrieved values and the local attention contexts. In our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms baseline models on longcontext language modeling benchmarks while having $114 x$ comprehension ratio in terms of memory size. The model achieves even better perplexity when trained with 100 K sequence length. A 1B LLM naturally scales to 1M sequence length and solves the passkey retrieval task when injected with Infini-attention. Finally, we show that a 8B model with Infiniattention reaches a new SOTA result on a 500 K length book summarization task after continual pre-training and task fine-tuning. In summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce a practical and yet powerful attention mechanism - Infini-attention with long-term compressive memory and local causal attention for efficiently modeling both long and short-range contextual dependencies. 2. Infini-attention introduces minimal change to the standard scaled dot-product attention and supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long-context adaptation by design. 3. Our approach enables Transformer LLMs to scale to infinitely long context with a bounded memory and compute resource by processing extremely long inputs in a streaming fashion. ## 2 Background\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process a single token $x_{t}$ at each step $t$ and computes a recurrent hidden state $h_{t}$ to represent an entire input sequence Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Maass et al. 2002):\n\n$$\nh_{t}=R N N\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe RNN computation is very efficient since the model maintains only a fixed-size vector $h_{t}$ for input sequence. However, for processing long sequences it becomes difficult to store entire contextual information into a single fixed-size vector and this limitation had implications on RNNs utility in certain tasks (Kaiser \\& Sutskever, 2015). To address the limitation, people extended the standard RNNs with an external memory component that can be read from and written to. One such an instance is Metalearned Neural Memory (MNM) (Munkhdalai et al., 2019):\n\n$$\nh_{t}, \\theta_{t}=M N M\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}, \\theta_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nMNM learns an additional memory state $\\theta$ parameterized by a feed-forward neural network (FFN) and uses query, key and value vectors (QKV) to interact with the memory, similar to the attention mechanism. To store information, it modifies the parameters of the FFN by using the key vectors as input and the value vectors for the target, and to read memory\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dbb8cf178811d16c1412g-03.jpg?height=663&width=1391&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 2: Infini-Transformer (top) has an entire context history whereas Transformer-XL (bottom) discards old contexts since it caches the KV states for the last segment only. entries, it forward-passes the query vectors through the memory FFN and retrieves its corresponding value. Like RNNs, the memory state is still bounded in MNM. Unlike the RNNs, the attention mechanism however doesn't maintain a recurrent state and only performs a feed-forward computation on input sequence segment $X_{s}$ :\n\n$$\nO_{s}=\\operatorname{attention}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe attention output $O_{s}$ is simply passed to the next layer and no state is carried over to the next input sequence $X_{s+1}$ at the same attention layer. In the attention layer, in order to capture the dependency between the consequent segments $X_{s}$ and $X_{s+1}$, one needs to process them altogether at the same time and this process becomes a bottleneck requiring large computational resources as the length of input sequence grows more and more. To improve the efficiency while still being able to benefit from the expressiveness of the attention mechanism, this work introduces a recurrent attention layer. ## 3 Method\n\nFigure 2 compares our model, Infini-Transformer, and Transformer-XL (Dai et al, 2019). Similar to Transformer-XL, Infini-Transformer operates on a sequence of segments. We compute the standard causal dot-product attention context within each segment. So the dot-product attention computation is local in a sense that it covers a total $N$ number of tokens of the current segment with index $S$ ( $N$ is the segment length). The local attention (Dai et al., 2019), however, discards the attention states of the previous segment when processing the next one. In Infini-Transformers, instead of leaving out the old KV attention states, we propose to reuse them to maintain the entire context history with a compressive memory. So each attention layer of Infini-Transformers has both global compressive and local fine-grained states. We call such an efficient attention mechanism Infini-attention, which is illustrated in Figure 1 and described formally in the following sections. ### 3.1 Infini-attention\n\nAs shown Figure 1, our Infini-attention is a recurrent attention mechanism that computes both local and global context states and combine them for its output. Similar to multi-head\nattention (MHA), it maintains $H$ number of parallel compressive memory per attention layer ( $H$ is the number of attention heads) in addition to the dot-product attention and like the RNNs and MNM, it maintains a recurrent memory state to efficiently track the long sequence context:\n\n$$\nO_{s}, M_{s}=\\text { infini-attention }\\left(X_{s}, M_{s-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.1.1 Scaled Dot-product Attention\n\nThe multi-head scaled dot-product attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), specially its self-attention variant (Munkhdalai et al., 2016. Cheng et al., 2016), has been the main building block in LLMs. The MHA's strong capability to model context-dependent dynamic computation and its conveniences of temporal masking have been leveraged extensively in the autoregressive generative models. A single head in the vanilla MHA computes its attention context $A_{\\text {dot }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from sequence of input segments $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ as follows.

The state sharing and reusing between the dot-product attention and compressive memory not only enables efficient plug-in-play long-context adaptation but also speeds up training and inference. Similar to the prior work (Munkhdalai et al., 2019), our goal is to store bindings of key and value states in the compressive memory and retrieve by using the query vectors. While there are different forms of compressive memory proposed in the literature (Hopfield, 1982; Kanerva, 1988; Schlag et al., 2019; Munkhdalai et al., 2019), for simplicity and computational efficiency, in this work we parameterize the memory with an associative matrix (Schlag et al., 2020). This approach further allows us to cast the memory update and retrieval process as linear attention mechanism (Shen et al., 2018) and to leverage stable training techniques from the related methods. Specially, we adopt the update rule and retrieval mechanism by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) mainly due to its simplicity and competitive performance. Memory retrieval.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token. (b) In the LoMA model's autoregressive generation, the previous context's KV cache is first compressed, and the input token is processed with the compressed KV cache by the attention module. 2023), when fine-tuned with the LoMA training method, is capable of high-ratio lossless memory compression of its own KV cache. Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models. Chapter 2 reviews several studies related to our methodology, Chapter 3 provides an in-depth explanation of the LoMA generation algorithm, Chapter 4 describes the training precedure for endowing the transformer model with memory compression capabilities, Chapter 5 discusses our experimental results, and Chapter 6 concludes with a summary of our work.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/16 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nSee Tab.2. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nWe propose the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), aimed at losslessly compressing information to reduce computational consumption in long text contexts. The advantages of this approach are: 1) It does not alter the model structure, allowing for an expansion of the model's contextual length to $c$ times its original size for most models; 2) It does not require additional annotated data and can be fine-tuned directly on pre-trained models; 3) It allows for segmental compression, and each compression only adds one inference process, avoiding a significant increase in generation time. We fine-tuned the LLaMA 7B model with LoMA on the C4 and GSM8K datasets, achieving convergence within 2000 iterations. Moreover, we found that information compression has good generalizability; models trained on C4 can be seamlessly generalized to the GSM8K dataset. We suggest adopting LoMA in pretraining to address the increasingly important scenarios of long texts in the future. ## References\n\nCobbe, K., Kosaraju, V., Bavarian, M., Chen, M., Jun, H., Kaiser, L., Plappert, M., Tworek, J., Hilton, J., Nakano, R., Hesse, C., and Schulman, J.

The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded.

The compression loss here refers to the attention-reconstruction attention loss. We plot this for a 24 layer trained model on Enwik8, and an 18 layer model trained on WikiText-103. The compression loss for characterbased language modelling is about one order of magnitude lower than that of word-level language modelling. The first layer's representations are highly compressible, however from then on there is no fixed trend. Some non-contiguous layers have a very similar compression loss (e.g. $4 \\& 6,5 \\&$ 7) which suggests information is being routed from these layer pairs via the skip connection. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_61e37e4a6d9216483704g-15.jpg?height=323&width=1392&top_left_y=798&top_left_x=364)\n\nFigure 6: Model analysis. Compression loss broken down by layer. ## B COMPARISON OF COMPRESSED MEMORY SIZES\n\nWe compare the best test perplexity obtained for the Compressive Transformer trained on WikiText103 and Enwik8 across a range of compressed memory sizes. For both models, the best model used a 1D convolution compression network with a compression rate of 3. The Enwik8 model was trained with an embedding size of 1024,8 attention heads, 24 layers, an mlp hidden size of 3072 , a sequence window size of 768 , and a memory size of 768 . We see the best compressed memory size is 3,072 in this sweep, facilitating a total attention window of 3840. The WikiText-103 model was trained with an embedding size of 1024, adaptive inputs using the same parameters as (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019), 16 attention heads, 18 layers, an mlp hidden size of 4096, a sequence window of size 512 and a memory of size 512.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: dynamic sparse attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems,\nwhich seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of\nactions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches\nhave proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nMarkov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of\njust their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for\nlonger-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods\nperform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,\nwhile RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is\naffordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a\nself-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture\nlong-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its\npredictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,\nSASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action\nhistory, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies\nshow that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models\n(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.\nMoreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable\nCNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our\nmodel adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful\npatterns in activity sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. DSVT: Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer with Rotated Sets\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Bernt Schiele, Di He, Sen Wang, Meng Lei, Shaoshuai Shi, Chen Shi, Haiyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing an efficient yet deployment-friendly 3D backbone to handle sparse point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D perception. Compared with the customized sparse convolution, the attention mechanism in Transformers is more appropriate for flexibly modeling long-range relationships and is easier to be deployed in real-world applications. However, due to the sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse points. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a single-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D perception. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local regions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features of all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection, we design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support effective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose an attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and deployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a broad range of 3D perception tasks. More importantly, DSVT can be easily deployed by TensorRT with real-time inference speed (27Hz).

Slide-Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer with Local Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Zhuofan Xia, Tianzhu Ye, Xuran Pan*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been a key factor in the recent progress of Vision Transformer (ViT), which enables adaptive feature extraction from global contexts. However, existing self-attention methods either adopt sparse global attention or window attention to reduce the computation complexity, which may compromise the local feature learning or subject to some handcrafted designs. In contrast, local attention, which restricts the receptive field of each query to its own neighboring pixels, enjoys the benefits of both convolution and self-attention, namely local inductive bias and dynamic feature selection. Nevertheless, current local attention modules either use inefficient Im2Col function or rely on specific CUDA kernels that are hard to generalize to devices without CUDA support. In this paper, we propose a novel local attention module, Slide Attention, which leverages common convolution operations to achieve high efficiency, flexibility and generalizability. Specifically, we first re-interpret the column-based Im2Col function from a new row-based perspective and use Depthwise Convolution as an efficient substitution. On this basis, we propose a deformed shifting module based on the re-parameterization technique, which further relaxes the fixed key/value positions to deformed features in the local region. In this way, our module realizes the local attention paradigm in both efficient and flexible manner. Extensive experiments show that our slide attention module is applicable to a variety of advanced Vision Transformer models and compatible with various hardware devices, and achieves consistently improved performances on comprehensive benchmarks. Code is available at https://github.com/LeapLabTHU/Slide-Transformer.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on \"dynamic sparse attention mechanisms\" and \"compressive memory systems in attention models,\" here are some key insights and relevant techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Dynamic Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n### SeerAttention\nThe SeerAttention mechanism introduced in the recent paper is a significant advancement. It enhances conventional attention by incorporating a learnable gate that adaptively selects significant blocks in the attention map, making the rest sparse. This approach allows for dynamic sparsity that adapts to varying context lengths and sparsity ratios, which is crucial for efficiency and scalability. SeerAttention achieves a remarkable 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context length with minimal perplexity loss and offers a 5.67x speedup over FlashAttention-2.\n\n## Compressive Memory Systems in Attention Models\n\n### Hierarchical and Sparse Attention\nThe concept of hierarchical memory management, as proposed in the HierarchicalLinearAttention (HLA) framework, can be enhanced by integrating dynamic sparse attention mechanisms. For instance, the Infini-attention model mentioned in the analysis [Future Search Plan] incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism, enabling efficient processing of long sequences. This aligns well with the goal of managing long-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n### Adaptive and Learnable Sparsity\nThe dynamic nature of sparsity in attention mechanisms, as highlighted in SeerAttention, is essential for compressive memory systems. By learning the sparsity patterns directly from the data, models can adaptively harness sparsity, improving efficiency without significant accuracy loss.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Algorithms\nResearch such as \"Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory\" suggests that attention mechanisms can be optimized to require $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length. This is crucial for implementing memory-efficient hierarchical processing in models like HLA[Future Search Plan].\n\n### Multi-Scale Attention and Hierarchical Processing\nTechniques like HiPPO and other hierarchical models demonstrate the effectiveness of managing dependencies and context through hierarchical structures. Combining these with dynamic sparse attention mechanisms can further enhance the efficiency and scalability of autoregressive language models[Future Search Plan].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Integration with Other Techniques\nIntegrating dynamic sparse attention with other memory-efficient techniques, such as those discussed in TRAMS (training-free memory selection) and Simple Linear Attention Language Models (IO-aware algorithms), can provide a comprehensive approach to optimizing both memory usage and computational efficiency[Future Search Plan].\n\n### Real-World Applications\nDynamic attention mechanisms, as discussed in the context of AI systems, have been successfully applied in various domains, including natural language processing and computer vision. These applications highlight the versatility and potential benefits of such mechanisms in improving model performance and interpretability.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages dynamic sparse attention mechanisms and compressive memory systems, leading to improved efficiency, scalability, and overall performance.\n",

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg.

However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/44 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nH., Gonzalez, J.

Hierarchical Context Merging: Better Long Context Understanding for Pre-trained LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical attention memory management*\n\n*Jinwoo Shin, Jung-Woo Ha, Sukmin Yun, Jaehyung Kim, Sangwoo Mo, Seunghyuk Oh, Woomin Song*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, a primary constraint they face is the context limit, i.e., the maximum number of tokens they can process. Previous works have explored architectural changes and modifications in positional encoding to relax the constraint, but they often require expensive training or do not address the computational demands of self-attention. In this paper, we present Hierarchical cOntext MERging (HOMER), a new training-free scheme designed to overcome the limitations. HOMER uses a divide-and-conquer algorithm, dividing long inputs into manageable chunks. Each chunk is then processed collectively, employing a hierarchical strategy that merges adjacent chunks at progressive transformer layers. A token reduction technique precedes each merging, ensuring memory usage efficiency. We also propose an optimized computational order reducing the memory requirement to logarithmically scale with respect to input length, making it especially favorable for environments with tight memory restrictions. Our experiments demonstrate the proposed method's superior performance and memory efficiency, enabling the broader use of LLMs in contexts requiring extended context. Code is available at https://github.com/alinlab/HOMER.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model with hierarchical attention, multi-scale attention, and hardware-aware memory management, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Hierarchical Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of hierarchical attention is crucial for capturing complex and multi-scale patterns in data. For instance, the Hierarchical Attention-based Recurrent Neural Network (HARNN) for text classification demonstrates how hierarchical attention can be effective in capturing hierarchical patterns in documents.\n\n## Multi-Scale Attention Processing\n\n- The SeerAttention mechanism introduces a way to adaptively select significant blocks in an attention map, which can be seen as a form of multi-scale attention. This approach learns the sparsity in attention maps dynamically, rather than relying on predefined patterns, and it balances accuracy and speedup effectively.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Memory Management\n\n- The S2-Attention architecture emphasizes the importance of hardware-aware design for sparse attention mechanisms. It proposes heterogeneous context sharding among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens, ensuring full context coverage while optimizing memory IO and parallelization. This approach achieves significant speedups in both training and inference without compromising performance.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- The S2-Attention model demonstrates substantial efficiency gains by combining sparse and dense attention. It achieves a 2.5X training speedup and a 4.5X inference speedup for 7B models, while maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks. This hybrid architecture ensures that the model has access to all tokens at certain layers, which is crucial for long-context tasks.\n\n## Novelty and Distinctiveness\n\n- The SeerAttention mechanism stands out by learning attention sparsity dynamically, which is distinct from previous methods that rely on predefined sparsity patterns or heuristics. This adaptability could be a key innovation in the proposed HierarchicalLinearAttention (HLA) model.\n\n## Expressiveness and Robustness\n\n- The use of multi-scale attention and hierarchical processing can enhance the model's expressiveness by capturing patterns at different scales. The hybrid architecture of S2-Attention, which combines sparse and dense attention, ensures that the model maintains strong performance on challenging long-context tasks while optimizing efficiency.\n\n## Alignment with Current Research Trends\n\n- Current trends in efficient attention mechanisms, such as SeerAttention and S2-Attention, focus on leveraging sparsity, adaptive learning, and hardware-aware designs. These approaches align well with the goals of improving efficiency, scalability, and expressiveness in autoregressive language models.\n\n### Key Takeaways for the Researcher\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Incorporate hierarchical attention mechanisms that can capture multi-scale patterns, similar to HARNN or the hierarchical normative models discussed in other contexts.\n- **Multi-Scale Attention**: Implement dynamic learning of attention sparsity, such as in SeerAttention, to adaptively select significant blocks in attention maps.\n- **Hardware-Aware Memory Management**: Adopt heterogeneous context sharding and hybrid architectures that combine sparse and dense attention, as in S2-Attention, to optimize memory IO and parallelization.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Ensure that the proposed model leverages these techniques to achieve significant speedups in training and inference without compromising performance on long-context tasks.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive language model that enhances efficiency, scalability, and expressiveness while aligning with current research trends.\n",

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/51 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\n(2020), but the elementwise operations in the recurrent update cannot make use of tensor cores and result in low arithmetic intensity. Hence, while the recurrent form generally has the lowest total FLOPs among the three forms, this does not translate to actual wall-time efficiency. And while it is theoretically possible to parallelize linear recurrences via the parallel scan algorithm, this method requires materializing the 2D hidden state for each time step. This incurs a significant memory I/O burden, thereby offsetting the benefits of parallelism over the sequence length and resulting in slow actual running speeds, as in Katsch (2023). Parallel form. The parallel form could be as efficient as FlashAttention using similar I/O optimization techniques, as demonstrated by Qin et al. (2023b). However, the high number of FLOPs (due to the quadratic complexity) makes the long-sequence training expensive, the same issue that the na\u00efve implementation of softmax attention would suffer from. Chunkwise form. The chunkwise parallel form, which interpolates between the parallel and recurrent forms with an extra \"parameter\" $C$, makes it possible to more easily make the above tradeoffs for fine-grained optimization. Unlike the recurrent form, most operations can be done via matmuls, enabling the use of tensor cores (if $C$ is set to a multiple of 16). Though the chunkwise training algorithm has been discussed before in the literature (Hua et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2023a), most implementations are not I/O-aware and thus slower than FlaShATtENTION for moderate sequence lengths (e.g., 2K-4K). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=622&width=663&top_left_y=223&top_left_x=257)\n\nFigure 1: (a) FLASHLINEARATTENTION without materialization. This version is more memory-efficient. (b-c) FlASHLINEARATTENTION with materialization. This version enables sequence-level chunkwise parallelism. ### 3.3 FlashLinearAttention: Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention with the Chunkwise Form\n\nWe describe our I/O-aware, hardware-efficient implementation of the chunkwise form. We give two versions, whose forward and backward passes differ depending on whether the chunk-level hidden states $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ are materialized in HBM. See Alg. 1 and Fig. 1 for the forward pass. (Alg. 2 in the appendix describes the backward pass.) At a high level, we use tiling to load tensors block-by-block and re-use tensor blocks on chip to avoid multiple HBM I/O as much as possible. For example, when $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ is loaded to SRAM, both $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{S}$ and $\\left(\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]} \\mathbf{K}_{[n]}^{\\top} \\odot \\mathbf{M}\\right) \\mathbf{V}_{[n]}$ can be computed on chip, which avoids loading $\\mathbf{Q}_{[n]}$ twice, thus saving HBM I/O. The non-materialization version computes $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ sequentially for $n \\in[N]$, using SRAM to temporarily store $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$, which is memory-efficient. This version parallelizes across batch size, number of heads, and head dimensions, but lacks sequence-level parallelim. When the batch size is large, this level of parallelism is sufficient to enable high GPU occupancy. In long-sequence and large scale training settings where batch size is small, the SMs cannot be fully exploited in this case. The materialization version first performs the inter-chunk recurrence (Eq. 2) and stores all $\\mathbf{S}_{[n]}$ for $n \\in[N]$ in HBM. Then, the $\\mathbf{O}_{[n]}$ 's can be computed in parallel for all chunks. This approach offers better parallelism but increases the memory footprint by approximately 10-20\\%. We mitigate this through recomputation, where the hidden states discarded after the forward pass and recomputed during the backward pass. We find this introduces a small runtime overhead but significantly reduces the memory footprint, and we adopt this strategy by default. Figure 2 shows the speed and memory footprint of our implementation. Both versions of FLASHLINEARATTENTION are substantially faster than FlASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023)\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_fe8f969e3ab84f3972dcg-04.jpg?height=475&width=811&top_left_y=234&top_left_x=1058)\n\nFigure 2: Speed comparison on a single H100 GPU with batch size 32 , number of heads 16 , head dimension 64 , and chunk size 64.\n```\n\n#### 2. Self-attention Does Not Need $O(n^2)$ Memory (Avg. Score: 0.38)\n\n*M. Rabe, Charles Staats*\n\n**Published in:**  (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention is provided.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a very simple algorithm for attention that requires $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length and an extension to self-attention that requires $O(\\log n)$ memory. This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/12 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\n| Sequence length | $n=2^{8}$ | $2^{10}$ | $2^{12}$ | $2^{14}$ | $2^{16}$ | $2^{18}$ | $2^{20}$ |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Size of inputs and outputs | 160 KB | 640 KB | 2.5 MB | 10 MB | 40 MB | 160 MB | 640 MB |\n| Memory overhead of standard attention | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 64 MB | 1 GB | OOM | OOM | OOM |\n| Memory overhead of memory-eff. attn. | 270 KB | 4.0 MB | 16 MB | 17 MB | 21 MB | 64 MB | 256 MB |\n| Compute time on TPUv3 | 0.06 ms | 0.11 ms | 0.7 ms | 11.3 ms | 177 ms | 2.82 s | 45.2 s |\n| Relative compute speed | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $\\pm 5 \\%$ | $-8 \\pm 2 \\%$ | $-13 \\pm 2 \\%$ | - | - | - |\n\nTable 2: Memory and time requirements of self-attention during inference. To exploit the parallelism available in modern hardware, we split the computation into chunks at the cost of some additional memory. In the outer loop (lines 54-55), we split the queries in to chunks of constant size, resulting in a linear number of iterations. In each iteration of the outer loop, we call _query_chunk_attention, which itself processes the keys and values in chunks (lines 30-31). The chunks are processed sequentially and each chunk is summarized independently (lines 12 to 19). Assuming a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values, we hence obtain $\\sqrt{n}$ summaries, giving rise to the $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory complexity. After the summaries are computed, they need to be rescaled (lines 33 to 36) along the lines of Section 3, before we return the values divided by the weights (line 40). The result of each iteration of the outer loop is directly written to the output tensor res (line 54), so that no additional memory is consumed across iterations. (A multi-stage summarization approach could achieve $O(\\log n)$ but would complicate the implementation.)\nWhile a constant chunk size for the queries and a chunk size of $\\sqrt{n}$ for the keys and values is optimal for memory consumption, the runtime is also affected by the choice of chunk size in practice, which is heavily affected by the choice of hardware. Ultimately, we have to leave this trade-off to the programmer, and expose the chunk sizes as arguments query_chunk_size and key_chunk_size. In Figure 1 we provide default values for the chunk sizes that lead to minimal runtime impact on TPU, while still providing significant memory savings. ## 5 Empirical Analysis\n\nIn this section, we experimentally compare the memory requirements and runtime performance of the suggested algorithm compared to the implementation of attention currently provided by Flax (Heek et al. (2020), see flax/linen/attention.py). We open-sourced the code of our implementation and most of the evaluation as a colab to help others reproduce the results: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/memory_efficient_attention. ### 5.1 Inference\n\nIn Table 2 we compare the memory requirements and the compute time of the memory-efficient attention implementation and the Flax implementation of attention.\n```\n\n#### 3. Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.37)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/24 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.23)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/44 (Score: 0.23)*\n\n```\nH., Gonzalez, J.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Deterministic Memory Abstraction and Supporting Multicore System Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware memory management*\n\n*Renato Mancuso, Farzad Farshchi, Prathap Kumar Valsan, Heechul Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Poor time predictability of multicore processors has been a long-standing challenge in the real-time systems community. In this paper, we make a case that a fundamental problem that prevents efficient and predictable real-time computing on multicore is the lack of a proper memory abstraction to express memory criticality, which cuts across various layers of the system: the application, OS, and hardware. We, therefore, propose a new holistic resource management approach driven by a new memory abstraction, which we call Deterministic Memory. The key characteristic of deterministic memory is that the platform - the OS and hardware - guarantees small and tightly bounded worst-case memory access timing. In contrast, we call the conventional memory abstraction as best-effort memory in which only highly pessimistic worst-case bounds can be achieved. We propose to utilize both abstractions to achieve high time predictability but without significantly sacrificing performance. We present deterministic memory-aware OS and architecture designs, including OS-level page allocator, hardware-level cache, and DRAM controller designs. We implement the proposed OS and architecture extensions on Linux and gem5 simulator. Our evaluation results, using a set of synthetic and real-world benchmarks, demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Victima: Drastically Increasing Address Translation Reach by Leveraging Underutilized Cache Resources\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware memory management*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Address translation is a performance bottleneck in data-intensive workloads due to large datasets and irregular access patterns that lead to frequent high-latency page table walks (PTWs). PTWs can be reduced by using (i) large hardware TLBs or (ii) large software-managed TLBs. Unfortunately, both solutions have significant drawbacks: increased access latency, power and area (for hardware TLBs), and costly memory accesses, the need for large contiguous memory blocks, and complex OS modifications (for software-managed TLBs). We present Victima, a new software-transparent mechanism that drastically increases the translation reach of the processor by leveraging the underutilized resources of the cache hierarchy. The key idea of Victima is to repurpose L2 cache blocks to store clusters of TLB entries, thereby providing an additional low-latency and high-capacity component that backs up the last-level TLB and thus reduces PTWs. Victima has two main components. First, a PTW cost predictor (PTW-CP) identifies costly-to-translate addresses based on the frequency and cost of the PTWs they lead to. Second, a TLB-aware cache replacement policy prioritizes keeping TLB entries in the cache hierarchy by considering (i) the translation pressure (e.g., last-level TLB miss rate) and (ii) the reuse characteristics of the TLB entries. Our evaluation results show that in native (virtualized) execution environments Victima improves average end-to-end application performance by 7.4% (28.7%) over the baseline four-level radix-tree-based page table design and by 6.2% (20.1%) over a state-of-the-art software-managed TLB, across 11 diverse data-intensive workloads. Victima (i) is effective in both native and virtualized environments, (ii) is completely transparent to application and system software, and (iii) incurs very small area and power overheads on a modern high-end CPU.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on **hardware-aware memory management in attention models**, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hardware-Aware Sparse Attention\n\n- The concept of **sparse attention** is crucial for efficient memory management. The paper on \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" introduces a novel sparse attention architecture, S2-Attention, which shards the context heterogeneously among attention heads. This approach ensures that each head attends to a different subset of tokens, collectively covering the full context. This design is optimized for hardware, leading to significant speed-ups (up to 4.5x in inference for 7B models) and maintaining strong performance on downstream tasks.\n\n## Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n- Combining sparse and dense attention can balance efficiency and performance. The S2-Attention model uses a hybrid architecture that achieves performance on par with full attention while providing substantial speed-ups in training and inference. This hybrid approach is particularly beneficial for long-context tasks, ensuring direct access to all tokens at certain layers.\n\n## Efficient Memory IO and Parallelization\n\n- **Hardware-aware optimization** is essential for translating computational savings into real-world efficiency gains. The S2-Attention model is designed with hardware and software systems in mind, optimizing memory IO and parallelization. This involves tiling the Q, K, V matrices into chunks that fit into SRAM for efficient computation, similar to FlashAttention but with improvements to handle sparse attention efficiently.\n\n## Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Hierarchical attention mechanisms**, such as those proposed in HiP Attention and Hierarchical Context Merging, can be highly effective. These mechanisms use dynamic sparse attention or hierarchical context merging to manage dependencies and context effectively. These approaches can inform the development of multi-scale attention in HLA, enhancing its efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Block Sparse Attention\n\n- The Block Sparse Attention library, introduced by the MIT HAN Lab, supports various sparse attention patterns, including streaming attention with token and block granularity. This library can significantly reduce the computational costs of LLMs, enhancing their efficiency and scalability. It is particularly relevant for long-context LLMs and can be integrated into the HLA framework.\n\n## Reducing Data Bottlenecks\n\n- Managing data bottlenecks is critical in distributed and heterogeneous neural network systems. The paper on reducing data bottlenecks in distributed neural networks highlights the importance of optimizing data movement between layers. Techniques such as using bottleneck layers to compress and encode information into smaller feature maps can reduce memory bandwidth requirements and enhance computational efficiency. This is relevant for optimizing the data flow in HLA.\n\n## Memristor-Based Acceleration\n\n- For future hardware optimizations, memristor-based accelerators can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer self-attention. These accelerators use in-memory computing to perform matrix operations, reducing power consumption and latency. While this is more about hardware implementation, it underscores the importance of considering hardware constraints and opportunities in the design of attention models.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that:\n\n- Utilizes hardware-aware sparse attention mechanisms to optimize memory IO and parallelization.\n- Employs hybrid attention architectures to balance efficiency and performance.\n- Implements hierarchical and multi-scale attention mechanisms to manage dependencies and context effectively.\n- Minimizes data bottlenecks through efficient data compression and encoding techniques.\n- Considers advanced hardware accelerators for future improvements.\n\nThese strategies will help in achieving low perplexity, high accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, efficiency in training and inference, and good scalability with larger models.\n",

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 2. TRAMS: Training-free Memory Selection for Long-range Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Haofei Yu, Cunxiang Wang, Yue Zhang, Wei Bi*\n\n**Published in:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (2023)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric, and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is crucial for numerous AI models, but it still faces challenges in long-range language modeling. Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nIt indicates that a large portion of information in memory is not fully utilized. This motivates us to explore better methods to optimize memory usage. Illustrated in Figure 1, we propose a TRAiningfree Memory Selection method (TRAMS) that can be directly plugged into memory-based long-range language models and reduces the time complexity of computing attention matrix. Through experiments on two language modeling benchmark datasets, namely word-level WikiText-103 (Merity et al., 2016) and character-level enwik8 (Mahoney, 2011), we achieve an improvement in the model's performance, as demonstrated by a 0.19 perplexity ( ppl ) drop in WikiText-103 and a 0.017 reduction in bits-per-character (bpc) in enwik8. To our knowledge, we are the first to design a training-free memory selection method based on Transformer-XL architecture. ${ }^{1}$\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Problem Definition\n\nWe use $\\boldsymbol{h} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ to represent the input hidden states for the attention module, $\\boldsymbol{o} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ to represent the output hidden states for the attention module, $\\boldsymbol{m} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{M \\times d}$ to represent the memory hidden states used in the attention calculation. We use $W_{Q}, W_{K}, W_{V}$ to represent the trainable projection matrix in the attention module. We define $d$ for the dimension of the model, $M$ for the memory size, and $N$ for the input size. The attention calculation process can be formally written as $\\boldsymbol{o}=\\operatorname{Attn}(\\boldsymbol{h}, \\boldsymbol{m})$. With the above annotations, the problem of memory selection can be defined as choosing a subset of hidden states memory $\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{m}}$ from the memory $\\boldsymbol{m}$ that brings the minimum difference to the transformer layer output but with a smaller memory size. $$\n\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{m}}^{*}=\\underset{\\tilde{\\boldsymbol{m}} \\subset \\boldsymbol{m}}{\\arg \\min }\\|\\operatorname{Attn}(\\boldsymbol{h}, \\tilde{\\boldsymbol{m}})-\\operatorname{Attn}(\\boldsymbol{h}, \\boldsymbol{m})\\|\n$$\n\n[^1]\n### 2.2 Attention Reformulation\n\nStandard Attention In a memory-augmented language model, the standard attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017) between input hidden states and memory hidden states can be written as:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{Attn}(\\boldsymbol{h}, \\boldsymbol{m})=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nwhere $Q=\\boldsymbol{h} W_{Q}$ is the product of target token hidden states $\\boldsymbol{h}$ and query projection matrix $W_{Q}$; $K=\\boldsymbol{m} W_{K}$ is the product of memory token hidden states $\\boldsymbol{m}$ and key projection matrix $W_{K}$; $V=\\boldsymbol{m} W_{V}$ is also the product of memory token hidden states $\\boldsymbol{m}$ and value projection matrix $W_{V}$. Unlimiformer Attention Different from the well-known attention score calculation, Unlimiformer (Bertsch et al., 2023) proposed a rewritten way to compute the dot-product part of crossattention in the encoder-decoder architecture:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ K^{\\top} & =\\left(\\boldsymbol{h}_{d} W_{Q}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{h}_{e} W_{K}\\right)^{\\top} \\\\\n& =\\left(\\boldsymbol{h}_{d} W_{Q} W_{K}^{\\top}\\right) \\boldsymbol{h}_{e}^{\\top}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\boldsymbol{h}_{e}$ is the encoder hidden state and $\\boldsymbol{h}_{d}$ is the decoder hidden state. It allows Unlimiformer to avoid indexing the keys for each head and layer separately and avoid storing values in a separate index from the keys during $k \\mathrm{NN}$-based searching and retrieval stage, making it more efficient. TRAMS Attention Even though we have no need to store or index any key or value for our method, Unlimiformer attention motivates us to transfer more useful information to keys by reformulating attention and allows us to do more effective memory selection solely based on reformulated keys. We can compute this attention formula in a different order but maintain the same result:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nQ K^{\\top} & =\\left(\\boldsymbol{h} W_{Q}\\right)\\left(\\boldsymbol{m} W_{K}\\right)^{\\top} \\\\\n& =(\\boldsymbol{h})\\left(\\boldsymbol{m} W_{K} W_{Q}^{\\top}\\right)^{\\top}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThus, we define $Q^{\\prime}=\\boldsymbol{h}$ as the reformulated query for this attention expression and $K^{\\prime}=\\boldsymbol{m} W_{K} W_{Q}^{\\top}$ as the reformulated keys for attention. With this reformulation, we transfer all attention-related parametric information onto reformulated key vectors. ### 2.3 Transformer Hidden Space\n\nSince $\\boldsymbol{h}$ is the input of the current transformer layer and also the output of the previous transformer layer, it is the result of the last layer's Layernorm\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_5c47e93541490f812b5fg-3.jpg?height=458&width=761&top_left_y=248&top_left_x=245)\n\nFigure 2: Norm distribution of reformulated $Q^{\\prime}$ and $K^{\\prime}$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While the time complexity is still $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59 X for inference and by 32 X for differentiation. ## 1 Introduction\n\nAttention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) is widely used in modern neural architectures. In particular, it is the heart of the Transformer architecture (Vaswani et al., 2017), which has revolutionized Natural Language Processing (Devlin et al., 2019), and found wide-spread adoption across several research areas since then. Given a query $q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ and lists of keys and values $k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{n}$ and $v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{n} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ of length $n$, attention is defined as follows:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=\\frac{e^{s_{i}}}{\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}\n$$\n\nThe result of the attention operation for a single query, is hence a weighted sum of the value vectors, where the weights are the softmax of the dot products of the query and the keys. The straight-forward implementation of the attention operation above requires us to first compute and remember $s_{i}$ for all $i$, leading to a $O(n)$ time and memory complexity for each query. Transformers use self-attention, which issues a separate query for each position in the sequence, so the overall time and space complexity is $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$. In many works the quadratic time and space complexity of self-attention has been used as the motivation for the investigation of variants of the original attention mechanism and architectures with more favorable complexity classes (Kitaev et al., 2020; Roy et al., 2021; Zaheer et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020; Ren et al., 2021; Child et al., 2019; Tay et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Shen et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2020). Modern accelerator hardware, such as GPUs and TPUs, are often memory constrained for applications in deep learning, while compute is relatively cheap. So the space complexity of transformers is a particular concern, c.f. Kitaev et al. (2020); Roy et al. (2021); Zaheer et al. (2020). In this work, we present new algorithms for attention and self-attention that require only constant memory and logarithmic memory, respectively. The basic algorithm is very simple; but it requires a trick to make it numerically feasible (see Section 3). We also present an implementation in JAX (Bradbury et al., 2018), which runs efficiently on TPUs, and requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory for self-attention (see Section 4 ). Unlike other works that aim to reduce the memory complexity of attention, the memory-efficient algorithm for attention that we suggest is not an approximation, but computes the same function. We can hence use the memory-efficient\nalgorithm as a drop-in replacement for other attention implementations to save memory. This may allow us to reconsider architecture choices, or scale to new datasets that require longer, dense attention. However, our algorithm still requires $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ time complexity for self-attention and $O(n)$ time complexity for single-query attention, and the various efficient, long-context attention mechanisms remain an interesting alternative to (dense) attention. ## 2 Algorithm\n\nFirst, we present the algorithm for the attention operation with a single query and extend the algorithm to self-attention at the end of this Section. We observe that the division by $\\sum_{j} e^{s_{j}}$ can be moved to the very end of the attention operation using the distributive law:\n\n$$\ns_{i}=\\operatorname{dot}\\left(q, k_{i}\\right), \\quad s_{i}^{\\prime}=e^{s_{i}}, \\quad \\text { attention }(q, k, v)=\\frac{\\sum_{i} v_{i} s_{i}^{\\prime}}{\\sum_{j} s_{j}^{\\prime}}\n$$\n\nAfter publishing our initial draft, we were made aware that (1) is a rediscovery of the \"lazy softmax\" method of Jang et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and Transformer-based LLMs (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023, Anil et al., 2023; Groeneveld et al. 2024) have a constrained context-dependent memory, due to the nature of the attention mechanism. The attention mechanism in Transformers exhibits quadratic complexity in both memory footprint and computation time. For example, the attention Key-Value (KV) states have 3TB memory footprint for a 500B model with batch size 512 and context length 2048 (Pope et al. 2023). Indeed, scaling LLMs to longer sequences (i.e. 1 M tokens) is challenging with the standard Transformer architectures and serving longer and longer context models becomes costly financially. Compressive memory systems promise to be more scalable and efficient than the attention mechanism for extremely long sequences (Kanerva, 1988; Munkhdalai et al., 2019). Instead of using an array that grows with the input sequence length, a compressive memory primarily maintains a fixed number of parameters to store and recall information with a bounded storage and computation costs. In the compressive memory, new information is added to the memory by changing its parameters with an objective that this information can be recovered back later on. However, the LLMs in their current state have yet to see an effective, practical compressive memory technique that balances simplicity along with quality. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enables Transformer LLMs to effectively process infinitely long inputs with bounded memory footprint and computation. A key component in our proposed approach is a new attention technique dubbed Infini-attention (Figure 1). The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism (Bahdanau et al., 2014, Vaswani et al. 2017) and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. Such a subtle but critical modification to the Transformer attention layer enables a natural extension of existing LLMs to infinitely long contexts via continual pre-training and finetuning. Our Infini-attention reuses all the key, value and query states of the standard attention computation for long-term memory consolidation and retrieval. We store old KV states of the attention in the compressive memory, instead of discarding them like in the standard attention mechanism. We then retrieve the values from the memory by using the attention query states when processing subsequent sequences. To compute the final contextual output, the Infini-attention aggregates the long-term memory-retrieved values and the local attention contexts. In our experiments, we show that our approach outperforms baseline models on longcontext language modeling benchmarks while having $114 x$ comprehension ratio in terms of memory size. The model achieves even better perplexity when trained with 100 K sequence length. A 1B LLM naturally scales to 1M sequence length and solves the passkey retrieval task when injected with Infini-attention. Finally, we show that a 8B model with Infiniattention reaches a new SOTA result on a 500 K length book summarization task after continual pre-training and task fine-tuning. In summary, our work makes the following contributions:\n\n1. We introduce a practical and yet powerful attention mechanism - Infini-attention with long-term compressive memory and local causal attention for efficiently modeling both long and short-range contextual dependencies. 2. Infini-attention introduces minimal change to the standard scaled dot-product attention and supports plug-and-play continual pre-training and long-context adaptation by design. 3. Our approach enables Transformer LLMs to scale to infinitely long context with a bounded memory and compute resource by processing extremely long inputs in a streaming fashion. ## 2 Background\n\nRecurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) process a single token $x_{t}$ at each step $t$ and computes a recurrent hidden state $h_{t}$ to represent an entire input sequence Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Maass et al. 2002):\n\n$$\nh_{t}=R N N\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe RNN computation is very efficient since the model maintains only a fixed-size vector $h_{t}$ for input sequence. However, for processing long sequences it becomes difficult to store entire contextual information into a single fixed-size vector and this limitation had implications on RNNs utility in certain tasks (Kaiser \\& Sutskever, 2015). To address the limitation, people extended the standard RNNs with an external memory component that can be read from and written to. One such an instance is Metalearned Neural Memory (MNM) (Munkhdalai et al., 2019):\n\n$$\nh_{t}, \\theta_{t}=M N M\\left(x_{t}, h_{t-1}, \\theta_{t-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nMNM learns an additional memory state $\\theta$ parameterized by a feed-forward neural network (FFN) and uses query, key and value vectors (QKV) to interact with the memory, similar to the attention mechanism. To store information, it modifies the parameters of the FFN by using the key vectors as input and the value vectors for the target, and to read memory\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dbb8cf178811d16c1412g-03.jpg?height=663&width=1391&top_left_y=292&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 2: Infini-Transformer (top) has an entire context history whereas Transformer-XL (bottom) discards old contexts since it caches the KV states for the last segment only. entries, it forward-passes the query vectors through the memory FFN and retrieves its corresponding value. Like RNNs, the memory state is still bounded in MNM. Unlike the RNNs, the attention mechanism however doesn't maintain a recurrent state and only performs a feed-forward computation on input sequence segment $X_{s}$ :\n\n$$\nO_{s}=\\operatorname{attention}\\left(X_{s}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe attention output $O_{s}$ is simply passed to the next layer and no state is carried over to the next input sequence $X_{s+1}$ at the same attention layer. In the attention layer, in order to capture the dependency between the consequent segments $X_{s}$ and $X_{s+1}$, one needs to process them altogether at the same time and this process becomes a bottleneck requiring large computational resources as the length of input sequence grows more and more. To improve the efficiency while still being able to benefit from the expressiveness of the attention mechanism, this work introduces a recurrent attention layer. ## 3 Method\n\nFigure 2 compares our model, Infini-Transformer, and Transformer-XL (Dai et al, 2019). Similar to Transformer-XL, Infini-Transformer operates on a sequence of segments. We compute the standard causal dot-product attention context within each segment. So the dot-product attention computation is local in a sense that it covers a total $N$ number of tokens of the current segment with index $S$ ( $N$ is the segment length). The local attention (Dai et al., 2019), however, discards the attention states of the previous segment when processing the next one. In Infini-Transformers, instead of leaving out the old KV attention states, we propose to reuse them to maintain the entire context history with a compressive memory. So each attention layer of Infini-Transformers has both global compressive and local fine-grained states. We call such an efficient attention mechanism Infini-attention, which is illustrated in Figure 1 and described formally in the following sections. ### 3.1 Infini-attention\n\nAs shown Figure 1, our Infini-attention is a recurrent attention mechanism that computes both local and global context states and combine them for its output. Similar to multi-head\nattention (MHA), it maintains $H$ number of parallel compressive memory per attention layer ( $H$ is the number of attention heads) in addition to the dot-product attention and like the RNNs and MNM, it maintains a recurrent memory state to efficiently track the long sequence context:\n\n$$\nO_{s}, M_{s}=\\text { infini-attention }\\left(X_{s}, M_{s-1}\\right)\n$$\n\n### 3.1.1 Scaled Dot-product Attention\n\nThe multi-head scaled dot-product attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), specially its self-attention variant (Munkhdalai et al., 2016. Cheng et al., 2016), has been the main building block in LLMs. The MHA's strong capability to model context-dependent dynamic computation and its conveniences of temporal masking have been leveraged extensively in the autoregressive generative models. A single head in the vanilla MHA computes its attention context $A_{\\text {dot }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from sequence of input segments $X \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {model }}}$ as follows. First, it computes attention query, key, and value states:\n\n$$\nK=X W_{K}, V=X W_{V} \\text { and } Q=X W_{Q} \\text {. }\n$$\n\nHere, $W_{K} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}, W_{V} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ and $W_{Q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {model }} \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ are trainable projection matrices. Then, the attention context is calculated as a weighted average of all other values as\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {dot }}=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\frac{Q K^{T}}{\\sqrt{d_{\\text {model }}}}\\right) V\n$$\n\nFor MHA, we compute $H$ number of attention context vectors for each sequence element in parallel, concatenate them along the second dimension and then finally project the concatenated vector to the model space to obtain the attention output. ### 3.1.2 Compressive Memory\n\nIn Infini-attention, instead of computing new memory entries for compressive memory, we reuse the query, key and value states ( $Q, K$ and $V$ ) from the dot-product attention computation. The state sharing and reusing between the dot-product attention and compressive memory not only enables efficient plug-in-play long-context adaptation but also speeds up training and inference. Similar to the prior work (Munkhdalai et al., 2019), our goal is to store bindings of key and value states in the compressive memory and retrieve by using the query vectors. While there are different forms of compressive memory proposed in the literature (Hopfield, 1982; Kanerva, 1988; Schlag et al., 2019; Munkhdalai et al., 2019), for simplicity and computational efficiency, in this work we parameterize the memory with an associative matrix (Schlag et al., 2020). This approach further allows us to cast the memory update and retrieval process as linear attention mechanism (Shen et al., 2018) and to leverage stable training techniques from the related methods. Specially, we adopt the update rule and retrieval mechanism by Katharopoulos et al. (2020) mainly due to its simplicity and competitive performance. Memory retrieval. In Infini-attention, we retrieve new content $A_{\\text {mem }} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ from the memory $M_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }} \\times d_{\\text {value }}}$ by using the query $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_{\\text {key }}}$ as:\n\n$$\nA_{\\text {mem }}=\\frac{\\sigma(Q) M_{s-1}}{\\sigma(Q) z_{s-1}}\n$$\n\nHere, $\\sigma$ and $z_{s-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\text {key }}}$ are a nonlinear activation function and a normalization term, respectively.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Relative to the baseline, our algorithm reduces data movement from HBM (slowerto-acccess memory) to SRAM (faster-to-access memory) by $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{2}\\right)$ bytes and from SRAM to register (fastest memory) by $O\\left(N d^{3}\\right)$ bytes (Section 5 ). 2. Sliding window attention exploits tensor cores, specialized units on modern GPUs for performing matrix multiplications (GEMMs). While popular architectures use long window sizes (e.g. 4096 for Mistral-7B [10]), we choose fixed size 64 windows, guided by hardware properties. In particular, we use just enough occupancy to hide the tensor core kernel launch latency. Although tensor cores operate on $16 \\times 16$ tiles, in Figure 1 (left), we see that the latencies for performing $16 \\times 16 \\mathrm{vs} .64 \\times 64$ (or even $128 \\times 128$ ) dimension matrix multiplications on NVIDIA H100 tensor cores are similar, informing our window size. In experiments, we show that BASED competes in quality with strong Transformer ++15 and SoTA sub-quadratic baselines in models up to the 1.3 Bn parameters across language modeling on the Pile language, DNA modeling, and the LM Eval Harness [16. Beyond this, BASED outperforms prior sub-quadratic architectures on the associative recall slice of the Pile and in downstream recall-intensive tasks by 0.14 perplexity points and 6.22 accuracy points, respectively. In efficiency, BASED enables up to $24 \\times$ higher throughput than the strong FlashAttention-2 implementation on generation.

While effective at recall 1 and efficient to train (Eq 1 is parallelizable on GPUs and $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ in memory with recent advances 12), attention remains expensive for generation. For every new output $\\boldsymbol{y}_{n}$, we require $n d$ operations over a growing $K V$-cache of prior $\\left\\{\\boldsymbol{k}_{i}, \\boldsymbol{v}_{i}\\right\\}_{i=1}^{n-1}$. This results in larger memory consumption and lower-throughput for longer sequences. Efficient attentions Various works thus try to improve on attention's efficiency without sacrificing quality. Sparse attentions reduce attention's time and memory requirements by only attending over specific strided patterns or local sliding windows [17, 18, 19. While further popularized in large language models (Mistral, Jiang et al. [10]), prior works either underperform full attention with sparse patterns that fail to capture dense interactions, or use large window sizes that still permit large KV-caches and subsequent inefficiency. Meanwhile, linear attentions replace the softmax in standard attention with alternative kernel functions 14 , 20, 21, 22, 23. By removing the $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{k}\\right)$ in favor of feature map dot-products $\\phi(\\boldsymbol{q})^{\\top} \\phi(\\boldsymbol{k})$, these methods use matrix product associativity to compute attention in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N d^{2}\\right)$ time and space 24. Furthermore, they permit a recurrent view for constant memory and $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ time per-token generation [25, 26. However, present linear attention feature maps either fail to match standard attention on recall or remain expensive to compute 13. Linear attentions also do not achieve faster wall-clock time or lower memory versus modern standard attention in practice 12 . Attention alternatives Finally, various models use attention-free sequence mixers such as state-space models (SSMs) [27, 28, gated convolutions [7, 9] and input-dependent recurrences [5, 8, to rival attention performance while improving its efficiency. However, while recent such models can match attention in overall perplexity, further study suggests they may underperform Transformers on tasks such as recall and in-context learning [1, 29]. ## 3 No Free Lunch: The Memory-Recall Tradeoff\n\nIn this section, we demonstrate a fundamental tradeoff between a model's memory consumption during inference (i.e., the size of its recurrent state) and its capacity to perform recall. We use a combination of experiments on synthetic data and theoretical analysis. - Empirical study of memory-recall tradeoff : In Section 3.1, we evaluate a number of popular architecture classes (e.g. Mamba, Hyena) on a synthetic associative recall task, varying hyperparameters that affect the model's recurrent state size (Figure 2). Within each architecture class, we observe a clear tradeoff: the larger the recurrent state size, the better recall. However, for a fixed recurrent state size, performance is not consistent across architectures. We observe that some sequence mixers fall well-below the pareto-frontier. This motivates the design of sequence mixers that can expand the pareto frontier. - Lower bounds on memory required for recall: In Section 3.2, we lower bound the recurrent state size required to perform exact recall with any recurrent model Theorem F.1. This analysis reinforces our empirical observations on the throughput-recall tradeoff. ### 3.1 Empirical study of memory-recall tradeoff\n\nSetup. We use a synthetic AR task called Multi-Query Associative Recall (MQAR) [1 to demonstrate the tradeoff.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: multi-scale attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Enhancing Few-Shot Image Classification through Learnable Multi-Scale Embedding and Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Mohammadi, Amirreza Fateh, Fatemeh Askari*\n\n**Abstract:** In the context of few-shot classification, the goal is to train a classifier using a limited number of samples while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, traditional metric-based methods exhibit certain limitations in achieving this objective. These methods typically rely on a single distance value between the query feature and support feature, thereby overlooking the contribution of shallow features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper. Our approach involves utilizing multi-output embedding network that maps samples into distinct feature spaces. The proposed method extract feature vectors at different stages, enabling the model to capture both global and abstract features. By utilizing these diverse feature spaces, our model enhances its performance. Moreover, employing a self-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage, leading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance. Furthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved performance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the MiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed a cross-domain task from MiniImageNet to the CUB dataset, achieving high accuracy in the testing domain. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, most of the existing works for IPT detection only concern monophonic music signals, yet little has been done to detect IPTs in polyphonic instrumental solo pieces with overlapping IPTs or mixed IPTs. In this paper, we formulate it as a frame-level multi-label classification problem and apply it to Guzheng, a Chinese plucked string instrument. We create a new dataset, Guzheng\\_Tech99, containing Guzheng recordings and onset, offset, pitch, IPT annotations of each note. Because different IPTs vary a lot in their lengths, we propose a new method to solve this problem using multi-scale network and self-attention. The multi-scale network extracts features from different scales, and the self-attention mechanism applied to the feature maps at the coarsest scale further enhances the long-range feature extraction.

LayoutLMv2: Multi-modal Pre-training for Visually-Rich Document Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: multi-scale attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lidong Zhou, Min Zhang, Wanxiang Che, Cha Zhang, Dinei Florencio, Yijuan Lu, Guoxin Wang, Furu Wei, Lei Cui, Tengchao Lv, Yiheng Xu, Yang Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-training of text and layout has proved effective in a variety of visually-rich document understanding tasks due to its effective model architecture and the advantage of large-scale unlabeled scanned/digital-born documents. We propose LayoutLMv2 architecture with new pre-training tasks to model the interaction among text, layout, and image in a single multi-modal framework. Specifically, with a two-stream multi-modal Transformer encoder, LayoutLMv2 uses not only the existing masked visual-language modeling task but also the new text-image alignment and text-image matching tasks, which make it better capture the cross-modality interaction in the pre-training stage. Meanwhile, it also integrates a spatial-aware self-attention mechanism into the Transformer architecture so that the model can fully understand the relative positional relationship among different text blocks. Experiment results show that LayoutLMv2 outperforms LayoutLM by a large margin and achieves new state-of-the-art results on a wide variety of downstream visually-rich document understanding tasks, including FUNSD (0.7895 $\\to$ 0.8420), CORD (0.9493 $\\to$ 0.9601), SROIE (0.9524 $\\to$ 0.9781), Kleister-NDA (0.8340 $\\to$ 0.8520), RVL-CDIP (0.9443 $\\to$ 0.9564), and DocVQA (0.7295 $\\to$ 0.8672). We made our model and code publicly available at \\url{https://aka.ms/layoutlmv2}.\n\n**Proceeding:** acl-2021-5\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on \"multi-scale attention mechanisms\" and \"deterministic memory abstraction in attention models,\" here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional relevant information:\n\n## Multi-Scale Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Multi-Scale Temporal Transformer (MSTR)\nThe MSTR model, as described in the paper on speech emotion recognition, incorporates a multi-scale temporal feature operator, a fractal self-attention module, and a scale mixer module. This architecture effectively enhances the model's ability to learn multi-scale local representations, reducing computational cost and improving performance. The fractal self-attention module models temporal relations within a fixed-length window, and the scale mixer module fuses features at different temporal scales, which can be a valuable approach for autoregressive language models to capture context at various scales.\n\n### Multi-Scale Spatially Adaptive Deformable Attention (MSADA)\nThe HMDA model introduces MSADA, which attends to a small set of key sampling points around a reference within multi-scale features. This mechanism is designed to address the issues of uniform and inflexible attention distribution in standard Transformers, making it more efficient and focused on salient regions. This approach could be adapted to language models to improve the attention mechanism's efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Hierarchical Vision Transformer (HVT)\nThe HVT architecture, used in computer vision, incorporates a multi-scale design that aggregates features from different scales. This approach can be translated to language models by using hierarchical attention mechanisms that capture long-range dependencies and establish global contextual information effectively. The use of multiple layers focusing on different scales can enrich the feature representation in language models as well.\n\n## Deterministic Memory Abstraction in Attention Models\n\n### Hardware-Aware Memory Management\nTechniques like FLASHLINEARATTENTION and deterministic memory abstraction are crucial for optimizing memory IO and parallelization. These methods involve tiling strategies to load tensors block-by-block, reducing memory movement and improving parallelizability. Implementing such hardware-aware memory management in autoregressive language models can significantly enhance their efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Attention Algorithms\nThe work on memory-efficient attention algorithms, such as those requiring $O(1)$ memory with respect to sequence length, involves chunking the computation. This approach can be integrated into hierarchical attention models to ensure that the memory usage does not scale quadratically with the sequence length, making the model more feasible for large-scale applications.\n\n### Hierarchical Attention Pruning\nModels like HiP Attention use a dynamic sparse attention mechanism with hierarchical attention pruning. This approach can help in implementing deterministic memory abstraction by dynamically pruning attention weights, reducing unnecessary computations and memory usage. This technique can be particularly useful in autoregressive models where efficient attention mechanisms are critical.\n\n## Future Directions\n\n- **Integrate Multi-Scale Attention**: Incorporate multi-scale attention mechanisms, such as those in MSTR and MSADA, into the autoregressive language model to capture context at various scales.\n- **Optimize Memory Management**: Use deterministic memory abstraction and hardware-aware tiling strategies to optimize memory IO and parallelization, ensuring the model's efficiency and scalability.\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Implement hierarchical attention models that use sparse and dynamic attention mechanisms to manage dependencies and context effectively.\n- **Experimental Validation**: Conduct thorough experiments to evaluate the influence of these techniques on the model's performance, computational cost, and scalability.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that leverages multi-scale attention mechanisms and deterministic memory abstraction, leading to improved performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",
