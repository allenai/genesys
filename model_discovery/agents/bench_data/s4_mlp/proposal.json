These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nWhile state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 3.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Transformer State Space Models\", \"S4 Layer Integration\", \"State Space MLP\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Transformer State Space Models\"*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4.

Since transformers are parameter-heavy, cannot benefit from history longer than a fixed window size, and are not computed using recurrence, we set out to investigate the suitability of the S4 family of models, which are based on state-space layers and have been shown to outperform transformers, especially in modeling long-range dependencies. In this work we present two main algorithms: (i) an off-policy training procedure that works with trajectories, while still maintaining the training efficiency of the S4 model. (ii) An on-policy training procedure that is trained in a recurrent manner, benefits from long-range dependencies, and is based on a novel stable actor-critic mechanism. Our results indicate that our method outperforms multiple variants of decision transformers, as well as the other baseline methods on most tasks, while reducing the latency, number of parameters, and training time by several orders of magnitude, making our approach more suitable for real-world RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Improving Grammatical Error Correction with Multimodal Feature Integration\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 Layer Integration\"*\n\n*Tao Fang, Jinpeng Hu, Derek F. Wong, Xiang Wan, Lidia S. Chao, Tsung-Hui Chang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework that integrates both speech and text features to enhance GEC is proposed that achieves significant improvements over strong baselines and achieves a new state-of-the-art result on the Falko-MERLIN test set.\n\n**Abstract:** Grammatical error correction (GEC) is a promising task aimed at correcting errors in a text. Many methods have been proposed to facilitate this task with remarkable results. However, most of them only focus on enhancing textual feature extraction without exploring the usage of other modalities\u2019 information (e.g., speech), which can also provide valuable knowledge to help the model detect grammatical errors. To shore up this deficiency, we propose a novel framework that integrates both speech and text features to enhance GEC. In detail, we create new multimodal GEC datasets for English and German by generating audio 1 from text using the advanced text-to-speech models. Subsequently, we extract acoustic and textual representations by a multimodal encoder that consists of a speech and a text encoder. A mixture-of-experts (MoE) layer is employed to selectively align representations from the two modalities, and then a dot attention mechanism is used to fuse them as final multimodal representations. Experimental re-sults on CoNLL14, BEA19 English, and Falko-MERLIN German show that our multimodal GEC models achieve significant improvements over strong baselines and achieve a new state-of-the-art result on the Falko-MERLIN test set.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Fetahu, Anjie Fang, Oleg Rokhlenko, S. Malmasi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This novel approach uses a token-level gating layer to augment pre-trained multilingual transformers with gazetteers containing named entities (NE) from a target language or domain to address the NER knowledge gap across languages and domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Named entity recognition (NER) in a real-world setting remains challenging and is impacted by factors like text genre, corpus quality, and data availability. NER models trained on CoNLL do not transfer well to other domains, even within the same language. This is especially the case for multi-lingual models when applied to low-resource languages, and is mainly due to missing entity information. We propose an approach that with limited effort and data, addresses the NER knowledge gap across languages and domains. Our novel approach uses a token-level gating layer to augment pre-trained multilingual transformers with gazetteers containing named entities (NE) from a target language or domain.This approach provides the flexibility to jointly integrate both textual and gazetteer information dynamically: entity knowledge from gazetteers is used only when a token\u2019s textual representation is insufficient for the NER task.Evaluation on several languages and domains demonstrates: (i) a high mismatch of reported NER performance on CoNLL vs. domain specific datasets, (ii) gazetteers significantly improve NER performance across languages and domains, and (iii) gazetteers can be flexibly incorporated to guide knowledge transfer. On cross-lingual transfer we achieve an improvement over the baseline with F1=+17.6%, and with F1=+21.3% for cross-domain transfer.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. VoxGRAF: Fast 3D-Aware Image Synthesis with Sparse Voxel Grids\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space MLP\"*\n\n*Katja Schwarz, Axel Sauer, Michael Niemeyer, Yiyi Liao, Andreas Geiger*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results demonstrate that monolithic MLPs can indeed be replaced by 3D convolutions when combining sparse voxel grids with progressive growing, free space pruning and appropriate regularization and allows for efficient rendering from arbitrary viewpoints while yielding 3D consistent results with high visual fidelity.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art 3D-aware generative models rely on coordinate-based MLPs to parameterize 3D radiance fields. While demonstrating impressive results, querying an MLP for every sample along each ray leads to slow rendering. Therefore, existing approaches often render low-resolution feature maps and process them with an upsampling network to obtain the final image. Albeit efficient, neural rendering often entangles viewpoint and content such that changing the camera pose results in unwanted changes of geometry or appearance. Motivated by recent results in voxel-based novel view synthesis, we investigate the utility of sparse voxel grid representations for fast and 3D-consistent generative modeling in this paper. Our results demonstrate that monolithic MLPs can indeed be replaced by 3D convolutions when combining sparse voxel grids with progressive growing, free space pruning and appropriate regularization. To obtain a compact representation of the scene and allow for scaling to higher voxel resolutions, our model disentangles the foreground object (modeled in 3D) from the background (modeled in 2D). In contrast to existing approaches, our method requires only a single forward pass to generate a full 3D scene. It hence allows for efficient rendering from arbitrary viewpoints while yielding 3D consistent results with high visual fidelity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 132  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 8.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P.

These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Block-State Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Transformer State Space Models\"*\n\n*Mahan Fathi, Jonathan Pilault, Orhan Firat, Christopher Pal, Pierre-Luc Bacon, Ross Goroshin*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have shown impressive results on tasks that require\nmodeling long-range dependencies and efficiently scale to long sequences owing\nto their subquadratic runtime complexity. Originally designed for continuous\nsignals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision\nand audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling\ntasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer\n(BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range\ncontextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term\nrepresentation of sequences. We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the\nBlock-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the\nlayer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model\nparallelization is employed.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-15T22:48:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-30T15:44:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Probabilistic Topic Modelling with Transformer Representations\n\n*From Search Query: \"Transformer State Space Models\"*\n\n*Arik Reuter, Anton Thielmann, Christoph Weisser, Benjamin S\u00e4fken, Thomas Kneib*\n\n**Abstract:** Topic modelling was mostly dominated by Bayesian graphical models during the\nlast decade. With the rise of transformers in Natural Language Processing,\nhowever, several successful models that rely on straightforward clustering\napproaches in transformer-based embedding spaces have emerged and consolidated\nthe notion of topics as clusters of embedding vectors. We propose the\nTransformer-Representation Neural Topic Model (TNTM), which combines the\nbenefits of topic representations in transformer-based embedding spaces and\nprobabilistic modelling. Therefore, this approach unifies the powerful and\nversatile notion of topics based on transformer embeddings with fully\nprobabilistic modelling, as in models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation\n(LDA). We utilize the variational autoencoder (VAE) framework for improved\ninference speed and modelling flexibility. Experimental results show that our\nproposed model achieves results on par with various state-of-the-art approaches\nin terms of embedding coherence while maintaining almost perfect topic\ndiversity.

Long Range Language Modeling via Gated State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 Layer Integration\"*\n\n*Harsh Mehta, Ankit Gupta, Ashok Cutkosky, Behnam Neyshabur*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models have shown to be effective at modeling long range\ndependencies, specially on sequence classification tasks. In this work we focus\non autoregressive sequence modeling over English books, Github source code and\nArXiv mathematics articles. Based on recent developments around the\neffectiveness of gated activation functions, we propose a new layer named Gated\nState Space (GSS) and show that it trains significantly faster than the\ndiagonal version of S4 (i.e. DSS) on TPUs, is fairly competitive with several\nwell-tuned Transformer-based baselines and exhibits zero-shot generalization to\nlonger inputs while being straightforward to implement. Finally, we show that\nleveraging self-attention to model local dependencies improves the performance\nof GSS even further.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-27T01:50:18Z  (*Updated: 2022-07-02T17:58:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Widening the Representation Bottleneck in Neural Machine Translation\n  with Lexical Shortcuts\n\n*From Search Query: \"S4 Layer Integration\"*\n\n*Denis Emelin, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer is a state-of-the-art neural translation model that uses\nattention to iteratively refine lexical representations with information drawn\nfrom the surrounding context. Lexical features are fed into the first layer and\npropagated through a deep network of hidden layers. We argue that the need to\nrepresent and propagate lexical features in each layer limits the model's\ncapacity for learning and representing other information relevant to the task.\nTo alleviate this bottleneck, we introduce gated shortcut connections between\nthe embedding layer and each subsequent layer within the encoder and decoder.\nThis enables the model to access relevant lexical content dynamically, without\nexpending limited resources on storing it within intermediate states. We show\nthat the proposed modification yields consistent improvements over a baseline\ntransformer on standard WMT translation tasks in 5 translation directions (0.9\nBLEU on average) and reduces the amount of lexical information passed along the\nhidden layers. We furthermore evaluate different ways to integrate lexical\nconnections into the transformer architecture and present ablation experiments\nexploring the effect of proposed shortcuts on model behavior.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-28T16:14:06Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-28T16:14:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Incorporating Exponential Smoothing into MLP: A Simple but Effective\n  Sequence Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space MLP\"*\n\n*Jiqun Chu, Zuoquan Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies in sequential data is a crucial step in\nsequence learning. A recently developed model, the Structured State Space (S4),\ndemonstrated significant effectiveness in modeling long-range sequences.\nHowever, It is unclear whether the success of S4 can be attributed to its\nintricate parameterization and HiPPO initialization or simply due to State\nSpace Models (SSMs). To further investigate the potential of the deep SSMs, we\nstart with exponential smoothing (ETS), a simple SSM, and propose a stacked\narchitecture by directly incorporating it into an element-wise MLP. We augment\nsimple ETS with additional parameters and complex field to reduce the inductive\nbias. Despite increasing less than 1\\% of parameters of element-wise MLP, our\nmodels achieve comparable results to S4 on the LRA benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-26T07:23:46Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-26T07:23:46Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space MLP\"*\n\n*Roger Waleffe, Wonmin Byeon, Duncan Riach, Brandon Norick, Vijay Korthikanti, Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Ali Hatamizadeh, Sudhakar Singh, Deepak Narayanan, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Vartika Singh, Jared Casper, Jan Kautz, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the\nshortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with\nsequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value\ncache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the\nlanguage modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive\nalternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far\nhave only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To\nunderstand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger\nscales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and\nTransformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also\ncompare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7%\nattention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks,\nwe answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger\ntraining budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed\nTransformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require\nstrong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook)\nor long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid\nexceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points\non average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at\ninference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional\nexperiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended\nto support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context\ntasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on\naverage.

State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: \"Transformer State Space Models\"*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"State Space MLP\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate Structured State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the S4 layer, into transformer architectures to enhance sequence modeling capabilities, here are the key insights and useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Benefits of S4 Layers in Transformers\n\n- **Long-Range Dependency Modeling**: S4 layers are designed to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, which is crucial for language modeling tasks. They can handle very long sequences with linear computational complexity, as highlighted in the analysis and supported by references such as Gu et al. (2021) and Gu et al. (2022).\n\n## Efficiency and Expressiveness\n\n- **Efficiency**: Integrating S4 layers maintains computational efficiency, which is essential for both training and inference. This is because S4 layers are optimized for fast processing of sequences.\n- **Expressiveness**: S4 layers enhance the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns, potentially improving perplexity and performance on downstream tasks.\n\n## Implementation and Integration\n\n- **State Space Representation**: The S4 layer uses a state-space formulation to process input embeddings. This can be integrated into the GAU framework by replacing or enhancing the existing MLP layers with S4 layers. The output dimensions and interfaces need to remain consistent with the rest of the model.\n- **Implementation Details**: Leveraging existing implementations of S4 layers from open-source libraries or research codebases can simplify the integration process. Careful initialization, gradient clipping, and learning rate scheduling are important for training stability.\n\n## Comparison with Transformers\n\n- **State-Space Models vs. Transformers**: Recent studies have shown that state-space models can outperform transformers in certain tasks, especially those requiring long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics. For example, the Mamba Neural Operator (MNO) leverages SSMs to capture long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively than traditional transformers.\n\n## Practical Considerations\n\n- **Training Stability**: Training SSMs can be sensitive to initialization and hyperparameters. Applying stabilization techniques such as careful initialization, gradient clipping, and learning rate scheduling is crucial.\n- **Resource Requirements**: While S4 layers may have higher memory or computation requirements, optimizing the implementation for efficiency can mitigate these challenges. Trade-offs between performance gains and resource usage need to be considered.\n\n## Relevant References\n\n- **Gu, A., et al. (2021).** \"Combining Recurrent, Convolutional, and Continuous-time Models with Linear State Space Layers.\" This paper provides a detailed explanation of how S4 layers can be integrated into various models, including transformers, to enhance sequence modeling capabilities.\n- **Gu, A., Goel, K., & R\u00e9, C. (2022).** \"Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces.\" This work demonstrates the efficiency and effectiveness of S4 layers in handling long sequences, which is directly relevant to the researcher's goals.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **State Space Models in Other Domains**: Studies in other domains, such as time series forecasting and solving partial differential equations (PDEs), have also shown the superiority of state-space models over transformer-based architectures in certain aspects. For example, the use of state-space models in time series forecasting has shown significant improvements in performance while using fewer parameters and less training data.\n\nBy integrating S4 layers into the SwiGluMLP GAU, the researcher can potentially enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, improve perplexity, and boost performance on downstream tasks, all while maintaining or improving computational efficiency.\n",

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/39 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(2024); Grazzi et al. (2024); Park et al. (2024) studied the difference between Transformers and Mamba at in-context learning, which can be seen as a form of copying. In particular, Aky\u00fcrek et al. (2024) finds that Transformers have an advantage over other architectures at this task because they have \" $n$-gram heads\". Similarly to these works, we hint the limitations of SSMs\nin memory-intensive tasks such as copying because of their limited state size. We also show that Transformers can perform copying using the Hard-ALiBi positional encoding, which improves the model's ability to learn $n$-gram matching. ## 6. Discussion\n\nWe have demonstrated through theory and experiments that transformers are better than GSSMs at copying from their input context. However, we emphasize that state space models have many advantages over transformers. The memory and computational complexity of GSSMs does not increase with the input length, which is ideal for training and inference on long inputs. Additionally, state space models such as RNNs are better at tracking state variables across long sequences (Liu et al., 2023a), which may be useful for generating long consistent text. Importantly, language processing in the human brain appears to be much more similar to how state space models process language (Tikochinski et al., 2024). We therefore believe that future work should focus on building hybrid architectures that endow state space models with an attention-like mechanism, allowing them to retrieve relevant pieces of text from their input. Indeed, humans have an incredibly limited capacity for memorizing sequences (Miller, 1956), but can translate entire novels if we allow them to look back at the text (Shelton, 1612).\n```\n\n#### 2.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWe use the same models configurations as done in Aky\u00fcrek et al.

(2024). the de facto superior model for language modeling, so it remains unclear how performance on this benchmark translates to real-world language ICL, where Transformers typically outperform LSTMs. On RegBench, which favors Transformers over attention-free models, Mamba indeed performs worse than Transformer, consistent with previous findings. Notably, hybrid architectures excel on this benchmark, converging much faster both Mamba and Transformer while achieving higher accuracy. Given prior evidence that Standard Hybrid achieves lower perplexity in language modeling ( $\\mathrm{Gu} \\&$ Dao, 2023), our new results suggest that hybrid models offer a promising direction for both language modeling and in-context learning on language tasks. We hope these results and analysis demonstrate the potential of hybrid models for language-based applications of ICL. ## 6 Discussion\n\nIn this work, we have provided a comprehensive investigation of in-context learning with state-space models (SSMs) and contrasted them with the Transformer architecture. Our study has revealed that SSMs, especially Mamba, are capable in-context learners. On the other hand, our evaluations revealed that neither SSMs nor Transformers are great at all tasks: SSMs struggle with decision tree and retrieval tasks whereas Transformers struggle with sparse parity. This has led us to the hybrid architecture MambaFormer which achieves a best-of-both-worlds performance on our ICL suite. Future research directions include exploring (1) how the performance on our ICL suite correlates with general language modeling capabilities, such as perplexity on standard NLP benchmarks, (2) developing more effective architectures by integrating elements from transformers, SSMs, and gating mechanisms, (3) identifying architectural features that contribute to effective in-context learning, and (4) assessing the impact of MambaFormer and other innovative architectures on language modeling performance. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive study of language modeling architectures which help identify their weaknesses, strengths, and provide recipes for new architectures. The outcomes of this work will potentially facilitate efficiency and architectural improvements for large language models. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThe work of Dimitris Papailiopoulos is supported in part by ONR Grant No. N00014-21-1-2806 and No. N00014-23-1-2848.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWhile state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Hybrid State Space Transformer\", \"Training Stability in SSMs\", \"Enhancing SSM Copying Abilities\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 2 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Marculescu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new Low-rank BackPropagation via Walsh-Hadamard Transformation (LBP-WHT) method, which substantially reduces the computation needed for adapting ViT, as matrix multiplication in the low-rank space is far less resource-intensive.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing scale of vision transformers (ViT) has made the efficient fine-tuning of these large models for specific needs a significant challenge in various applications. This issue originates from the computationally demanding matrix multiplications required during the backpropagation process through linear layers in ViT. In this paper, we tackle this problem by proposing a new Low-rank BackPropagation via Walsh-Hadamard Transformation (LBP-WHT) method. Intuitively, LBP-WHT projects the gradient into a low-rank space and carries out backpropagation. This approach substantially reduces the computation needed for adapting ViT, as matrix multiplication in the low-rank space is far less resource-intensive. We conduct extensive experiments with different models (ViT, hybrid convolution-ViT model) on multiple datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. For instance, when adapting an EfficientFormer-L1 model on CIFAR100, our LBP-WHT achieves 10.4% higher accuracy than the state-of-the-art baseline, while requiring 9 MFLOPs less computation. As the first work to accelerate ViT adaptation with low-rank backpropagation, our LBP-WHT method is complementary to many prior efforts and can be combined with them for better performance.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality.

Parallelizing Linear Transformers with the Delta Rule over Sequence\n  Length\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid State Space Transformer\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yu Zhang, Yikang Shen, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention (i.e., linear transformers) and\nstate-space models have recently been suggested as a viable linear-time\nalternative to transformers with softmax attention. However, these models still\nunderperform transformers especially on tasks that require in-context\nretrieval. While more expressive variants of linear transformers which replace\nthe additive outer-product update in linear transformers with the delta rule\nhave been found to be more effective at associative recall, existing algorithms\nfor training such models do not parallelize over sequence length and are thus\ninefficient to train on modern hardware.

Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training Stability in SSMs\"*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs\nlike the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities\nintroduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications.

Mitigating Copy Bias in In-Context Learning through Neuron Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Enhancing SSM Copying Abilities\"*\n\n*Ameen Ali, Lior Wolf, Ivan Titov*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive few-shot in-context\nlearning (ICL) abilities.

In this work, we propose a novel and simple\nmethod to mitigate such copying bias.

A ConvNet for the 2020s\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid State Space Transformer\"*\n\n*Saining Xie, Trevor Darrell, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Chao-yuan Wu, Hanzi Mao, Zhuang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"Roaring 20s\" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually \"modernize\" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hybrid State Space Transformer\"*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jan Kautz, Jared Casper, Vartika Singh, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Deepak Narayanan, Sudhakar Singh, Ali Hatamizadeh, Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Vijay Korthikanti, Brandon Norick, Duncan Riach, Wonmin Byeon, Roger Waleffe*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average.

GroupMamba: Parameter-Efficient and Accurate Group Visual State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training Stability in SSMs\"*\n\n*Fahad Shahbaz Khan, Juergen Gall, Salman Khan, Syed Talal Wasim, Abdelrahman Shaker*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in state-space models (SSMs) have showcased effective performance in modeling long-range dependencies with subquadratic complexity. However, pure SSM-based models still face challenges related to stability and achieving optimal performance on computer vision tasks. Our paper addresses the challenges of scaling SSM-based models for computer vision, particularly the instability and inefficiency of large model sizes. To address this, we introduce a Modulated Group Mamba layer which divides the input channels into four groups and applies our proposed SSM-based efficient Visual Single Selective Scanning (VSSS) block independently to each group, with each VSSS block scanning in one of the four spatial directions. The Modulated Group Mamba layer also wraps the four VSSS blocks into a channel modulation operator to improve cross-channel communication. Furthermore, we introduce a distillation-based training objective to stabilize the training of large models, leading to consistent performance gains. Our comprehensive experiments demonstrate the merits of the proposed contributions, leading to superior performance over existing methods for image classification on ImageNet-1K, object detection, instance segmentation on MS-COCO, and semantic segmentation on ADE20K. Our tiny variant with 23M parameters achieves state-of-the-art performance with a classification top-1 accuracy of 83.3% on ImageNet-1K, while being 26% efficient in terms of parameters, compared to the best existing Mamba design of same model size.

SSMs can efficiently model long-range dependencies, which aligns with the goals of enhancing the SwiGluMLP GAU.\n\n#### Layer-wise Nonlinearity\n- Adding nonlinearity at each layer of SSMs allows them to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship, enhancing the model's capacity to learn complex patterns. This is crucial for improving the model's performance on language tasks.\n\n#### Dense Connections\n- The DenseMamba approach, which integrates shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, retains fine-grained information and improves performance without sacrificing efficiency. This can be a valuable strategy for enhancing the SwiGluMLP GAU.\n\n#### Efficiency and Memory Management\n- SSMs handle long sequences with linear computational complexity and require only the latest input and state, reducing memory overhead compared to attention mechanisms.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Integration of SSMs into Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Feasibility and Benefits:** The integration of SSMs, particularly S4 layers, into transformer architectures is both feasible and beneficial. SSMs' ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently aligns with the goals of enhancing the SwiGluMLP GAU.\n\n- **Layer-wise Nonlinearity:** Wang & Xue (2023) highlight that adding nonlinearity at each layer of SSMs allows them to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship, enhancing the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.\n\n- **Dense Connections:** He et al. (2024) introduce DenseSSM, demonstrating that integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers retains fine-grained information and improves performance without sacrificing efficiency.\n\n### Strengths and Limitations of SSMs\n\n- **Strengths:**\n  - **Efficiency in Long Sequences:** SSMs handle long sequences with linear computational complexity, making them suitable for tasks requiring long-range dependency modeling.\n  - **Improved Memory Management:** Due to their recurrent nature, SSMs require only the latest input and state, reducing memory overhead compared to attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Limitations:**\n  - **Copying and In-Context Learning:** Jelassi et al.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nThis confirms recent findings at smaller scales (Park et al. 2024). In particular, we highlight the difficulty pure SSM models face with the standard five-shot MMLU (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020) and two-shot Phonebook tasks. For the former, after training for 1.1 T tokens, both Mamba and Mamba-2 models produce nearly 15 points lower accuracy when compared to a Transformer model on this task. While the MMLU accuracy gap is partially addressed by training with more tokens (e.g., 3.5T tokens), SSM models still lag behind Transformer models for this common benchmark. We find that Phonebook and standard long-context benchmark tasks remain challenging for SSM models regardless of the number of training tokens. Based on the above findings, we study in detail the potential for hybrid SSM-Transformer models to overcome the challenges faced by pure SSM architectures while retaining (some of) their inferencetime benefits. Similar to Lieber et al. 2024, we focus on LLMs consisting of a mixture of Mamba-2, self-attention, and MLP layers. Our ablation experiments aiming to identify the best hybrid model architecture lead us to design an 8B-parameter Mamba-2-Hybrid with 24 Mamba-2 layers, 4 self-attention layers, and 28 MLP layers. The self-attention and MLP layers are evenly distributed throughout the model. Extensive evaluations of this architecture show that it matches or exceeds Transformers on common natural language evaluations. When training for 3.5 T tokens, a Mamba-2-Hybrid model exceeds a corresponding Transformer on all 12 short-context benchmarks we evaluated. On MMLU, the hybrid model reaches a five-shot accuracy 3.5 points higher than the Transformer. We also study long-context extensions of Mamba-2-Hybrid and the corresponding Transformer to support 16 K and 32 K context lengths. On 23 long-context evaluations, the 16 K and 32 K models closely match or exceed the Transformer baselines on average. Our results show that the hybrid models are particularly good at retrieving, tracking, and aggregating information over long contexts. We highlight three multi-document question answering tasks, however, which challenged the long-context hybrid models. We discuss potential reasons for these results and highlight areas of future work related to\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_b92355d6bd48fca7f050g-03.jpg?height=744&width=1491&top_left_y=190&top_left_x=315)\n\nFigure 1: Mamba and Mamba-2 blocks with tensor model parallel size two. Mamba requires two all-reduces per layer while Mamba-2 requires only one. More details can be found in Dao and Gu 2024. extending hybrid SSM-Transformer models to long sequence lengths. Finally we highlight that, due to our use of global attention without any explicit position encoding in these models, long-context Mamba-2-Hybrid models can generalize beyond their trained sequence length. This is in contrast with recent hybrid models that use windowed attention and exhibit accuracy degradation on contexts larger than the window size but less than the pretraining sequence length (De et al. 2024). We find that a Mamba-2-Hybrid extended to support 128 K contexts can perform the Phonebook lookup task perfectly even when the phone book contains more than 150 K tokens. We present our findings above to highlight the promise for larger-scale SSM-based models to provide faster, more efficient language model inference without compromising training efficiency or model accuracy compared to Transformers. We hope that by releasing these results, the community is further excited by the potential of Mamba-based LLMs. To help enable further adoption, we release the code used to train our Mamba, Mamba-2, and Mamba-2-Hybrid hybrid models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM library (https:// github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM). We also release the model weights for our Mamba-2 8B and Mamba-2-Hybrid 8B on Hugging Face. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we discuss briefly our implementation of SSM layers in Megatron-LM and discuss the training data and evaluations used throughout this report. ### 2.1 Model Implementation\n\nTo support efficient large-scale training, we implement Mamba and Mamba-2 layers with support for tensor (Shoeybi et al. 2019), sequence (Korthikanti et al. 2022), and pipeline parallelism (Narayanan et al. 2021) (only for Mamba-2). As described in Dao and Gu 2024, tensor-parallel support for Mamba layers requires two all-reduces per block compared to just one all-reduce for Transformer layers (Figure 1), leading to increased communication overheads for training larger-scale Mamba models. Mamba-2 tensor parallel support, on the other hand, requires only one all-reduce per layer, but requires the use of GroupNorm rather than LayerNorm for the internal block normalization (see Figure 1). We found that using GroupNorm lead to no difference in validation loss when compared to using full LayerNorm as long as the group size (the model hidden dimension divided by the number of groups) is sufficiently large to allow for accurate calculations of the per-group normalization statistics (in our\nexperience this meant a group size greater than 256). To implement SSM-Transformer hybrid models, we combine our Mamba or Mamba-2 layers with the existing self-attention and MLP layers supported in Megatron-LM. These layers support all the previously mentioned parallelization strategies enabling us to immediately train hybrid models with tensor, sequence, and pipeline parallelism. ### 2.2 Training Data\n\nWe train the models discussed in this report on 1.1 T and 3.5 T token datasets. Both datasets are predecessors of the dataset used to train Nemotron-4 and are comprised of $70 \\%$ English, $15 \\%$ non-English, and $15 \\%$ code. For additional details, refer to the discussion included in the Nemotron- 4 technical report (Parmar et al. 2024). We use a vocabulary of 256 K tokens trained with SentencePiece (Kudo and Richardson 2018). ### 2.3 Evaluation Tasks and Setup\n\nWe now discuss the evaluations used throughout the paper. Wherever possible, we use open-source LLM benchmark suites to ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible. We report results using a large number of common tasks:\n\n- Standard Short-Context Tasks: We use the open-source LM Evaluation Harness library (commit 94cc1850) (L. Gao et al. 2023) to evaluate the following 12 tasks (metric used for evaluation reported in parentheses): WinoGrande (accuracy) (Sakaguchi et al. 2021), PIQA (accuracy) (Bisk et al. 2020), HellaSwag (normalized accuracy) (Zellers et al. 2019), ARCEasy and ARC-Challenge (accuracy and normalized accuracy) (Clark et al. 2018), MMLU (accuracy) (Hendrycks, Burns, et al. 2020), OpenBookQA (normalized accuracy) (Mihaylov et al. 2018), TruthFulQA (accuracy) (Lin, Hilton, and Evans 2021), PubMedQA (accuracy) (Jin et al. 2019), and RACE (accuracy) (Lai et al. 2017). Each of the proceeding tasks are evaluated by measuring the probability returned by the model for each possible answer choice. We also use the generation-based tasks Natural Questions (NQ) (exact match) (Lee, Chang, and Toutanova 2019) and SquadV2 (F1) (Rajpurkar, Jia, and Liang 2018). - Natural Long-Context Tasks: To evaluate long-context models, as above, we use three tasks from LM Evaluation Harness: NarrativeQA (F1) (Ko\u010disk\u1ef3 et al.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/37 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nWe use the same models configurations as done in Aky\u00fcrek et al.

Notably, hybrid architectures excel on this benchmark, converging much faster both Mamba and Transformer while achieving higher accuracy. Given prior evidence that Standard Hybrid achieves lower perplexity in language modeling ( $\\mathrm{Gu} \\&$ Dao, 2023), our new results suggest that hybrid models offer a promising direction for both language modeling and in-context learning on language tasks. We hope these results and analysis demonstrate the potential of hybrid models for language-based applications of ICL. ## 6 Discussion\n\nIn this work, we have provided a comprehensive investigation of in-context learning with state-space models (SSMs) and contrasted them with the Transformer architecture. Our study has revealed that SSMs, especially Mamba, are capable in-context learners. On the other hand, our evaluations revealed that neither SSMs nor Transformers are great at all tasks: SSMs struggle with decision tree and retrieval tasks whereas Transformers struggle with sparse parity. This has led us to the hybrid architecture MambaFormer which achieves a best-of-both-worlds performance on our ICL suite. Future research directions include exploring (1) how the performance on our ICL suite correlates with general language modeling capabilities, such as perplexity on standard NLP benchmarks, (2) developing more effective architectures by integrating elements from transformers, SSMs, and gating mechanisms, (3) identifying architectural features that contribute to effective in-context learning, and (4) assessing the impact of MambaFormer and other innovative architectures on language modeling performance. ## Impact Statement\n\nThis paper provides a comprehensive study of language modeling architectures which help identify their weaknesses, strengths, and provide recipes for new architectures. The outcomes of this work will potentially facilitate efficiency and architectural improvements for large language models. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThe work of Dimitris Papailiopoulos is supported in part by ONR Grant No. N00014-21-1-2806 and No. N00014-23-1-2848.

Here are the key points and most useful information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Feasibility and Benefits of Integrating SSMs\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Integrating SSMs with transformer architectures is feasible and beneficial. Models like MambaFormer and Block-State Transformers combine the strengths of SSMs (efficient long-range dependency modeling) and Transformers (strong copying and in-context learning abilities).\n- **Efficiency and Performance**: SSMs, such as Mamba-2, offer linear computational complexity and can be competitive with Transformers in language modeling tasks. Hybrid models like Mamba-2-Hybrid have been shown to exceed Transformers in various tasks.\n\n## Addressing Limitations of SSMs\n\n- **Copying Abilities**: SSMs struggle with tasks requiring strong copying abilities. Incorporating attention mechanisms, as seen in Taipan, which combines Mamba with Selective Attention Layers (SALs), can mitigate this limitation.\n- **In-Context Learning**: Hybrid models that integrate SSMs with attention layers have shown improved performance in in-context learning tasks. For example, MambaFormer achieves a best-of-both-worlds performance on in-context learning tasks.\n\n## Training Stability and Optimization\n\n- **Advanced Techniques**: Techniques such as decomposing matrix multiplications, grouped FIR filtering, attention sink mechanisms, and neuron pruning can enhance training stability and performance of SSMs. Neuron pruning, in particular, can improve generalization by mitigating copying bias.\n- **Layer-wise Nonlinearity**: Incorporating nonlinear activation functions at each layer of the SSM, such as using SwiGLU activation, can enhance the model's expressiveness and learning capacity.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\n- **Local Modifications**: The integration should focus on modifying the SwiGluMLP GAU to adhere to the constraint of localized changes. This can involve combining the existing MLP with an S4 layer sequentially or in parallel.\n- **Dense Connections**: Employing dense connections, as in DenseMamba, can facilitate information flow between layers, improving the retention of fine-grained information.\n\n## Potential Design Approaches\n\n- **Hybrid MLP-SSM Module**: Combining the existing MLP with an S4 layer within the GAU. This can be done sequentially or in parallel to leverage the strengths of both components.\n- **Sliding Window Attention**: Using Sliding Window Attention (SWA) can maintain linear time complexity while leveraging the benefits of attention, as seen in the Taipan model.\n\n## Future Research Directions\n\n- **Explore Hybrid Architectures**: Study detailed architectures of hybrid models like MambaFormer and Block-State Transformers to understand integration strategies and optimize performance.\n- **Advanced Training Techniques**: Research optimization methods, initialization strategies, and regularization techniques specific to SSMs and S4 layers to ensure stable training.\n\n### Key References\n\n- **\"Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\"** by Tri Dao and Albert Gu: This work introduces Mamba-2, a refinement of Mamba that is faster and competitive with Transformers.\n- **\"Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Much of the success of these models can be attributed to their self-attention layers (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2014), which enable all-to-all information routing between tokens in a sequence, and their ability to improve with scaling model and dataset sizes. However, self-attention layers suffer from some drawbacks that make training and deploying these models on long sequences challenging. At training time, the computation required for self-attention layers scales quadratically with the sequence length. At inference time, generating one token requires a memory capacity that scales linearly with the number of preceding tokens, necessitating a large key-value cache to store the required state. Many recent works have attempted to address the\n\n[^0]efficiency issues with self-attention layers (Tay et al. 2022); these works however have yet to match self-attention's language modeling capabilities. Structured state space models (Gu, Goel, and Re 2021), in particular Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023) and more recently Mamba-2 (Dao and Gu 2024), have been proposed as a promising alternative to self-attention layers and Transformers. These models use constant computation and memory to generate a single token at inference time (after initializing the SSM states based on the context) and can be computed efficiently using hardware-aware algorithms during training. They have been shown to match or exceed the downstream accuracy of Transformers on standard language modeling tasks for models up to 2.8 B parameters (Dao and Gu 2024; Gu and Dao 2023). Follow up work has sought to further probe the in-context learning abilities of these models at small scale (Park et al. 2024), and some recent work has investigated combining Mamba layers with attention layers to form hybrid models (Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024). These works scale Mamba-based hybrid models beyond 7B parameters and show that doing so can result in high quality models. However, in these studies the larger models were not compared with equivalent Transformers in a controlled setting (i.e., same training data, parameter count). Such controlled comparisons have been limited to small-scale experiments and larger-scale studies of Mamba-2 models are still lacking. In this technical report, we present a direct comparison between Mamba-based and Transformer-based LLMs trained on large datasets. In particular, our primary goal is to provide a rigorous apples-to-apples comparison between Mamba, Mamba-2, Mamba-2-Hybrid (containing Mamba-2, attention, and MLP layers), and Transformers for 8B-parameter models trained on up to 3.5 T tokens, with the same hyperparameters. Using a diverse set of natural language tasks, we answer the important question of whether Mamba models can match their Transformer counterparts at larger training budgets. We evaluate these models on 35 popular downstream language modeling tasks and use the exact same evaluation setup for Mamba-based and Transformer models. To ensure our evaluations are standard and reproducible, we provide details about the specific open-source benchmark suites and versions used in our experiments in Section 2. Overall, our experiments eliminate the common difficulty of comparing LLMs, where it is often the case that both the model architecture but also the training data, tokenizer, and evaluation pipeline have changed. Our experiments show that while Mamba and Mamba-2 models are good at modeling language (e.g., they match or exceed Transformers on many downstream tasks), they lag behind Transformer models when it comes to in-context learning and recalling information from the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/37 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1809.02789 (2018).

Copy and retrieval capabilities\n\nRecent work (Jelassi et al., 2024) has shown that Transformers can be significantly more efficient than state space models (SSMs), a popular new family of RNNs, at learning synthetic tasks such as copying the context or retrieving relevant tokens from the context. Additionally, Jelassi et al. (2024) showed that pre-trained Transformers such as Pythia (Biderman et al., 2023) are much better at copying and retrieval tasks at evaluation time compared to pre-trained SSM models such as Mamba (Gu and Dao, 2023). In this section, we investigate the efficiency of Griffin and Hawk in learning how to copy and retrieve tokens from the context. Additionally, we evaluate pre-trained Hawk and Griffin models on a phone number lookup task designed to test both copying and retrieval capabilities. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_235c9496c10750230447g-12.jpg?height=448&width=1655&top_left_y=287&top_left_x=209)\n\nFigure 6 | Exploring the copying and retrieval capabilities of Hawk and Griffin on three synthetic tasks. Figures (a) and (b) show the performance of 5 layer deep models on a held out eval set when explicitly trained on these tasks. Figure (c) shows the performance on a phone number lookup task when evaluating our pre-trained 7B Hawk and Griffin models against our 6B MQA Transformer baseline. Training on synthetic tasks To investigate the efficiency of learning how to copy and retrieve relevant tokens from the context, we train on two synthetic tasks: Selective Copying and Induction Heads. To be able to compare Transformers with Hawk and Griffin, we consider 5-block deep networks with model dimension 64 , totalling roughly 250 K parameters, where Griffin uses a single local attention in the middle of the network, in the third block. - Selective copying task: In this task, the model needs to learn to copy data tokens from a sequence while ignoring noise tokens from the context. See Appendix H for more details on the setup for this task. This task is inspired by Gu and Dao (2023), where the authors showed that Mamba was able to solve this task better than previously proposed SSMs. We use a vocabulary size of 16 , and train on sequences of length 1024, containing 16 data tokens (randomly sampled from the vocabulary and at random locations), with the rest of the tokens set to the noise token. Griffin uses a local attention window size of 512 . - Induction heads: In this task, the model needs to learn to recall the token immediately following a special token. This requires the model to learn the special token, and retrieve the token immediately following it in the context. If the model is able to learn the task, it should be able to extrapolate to significantly longer sequences than it was trained for. We use a vocabulary size of 16 and train on sequences of length 256 where the tokens are sampled randomly, and we randomly sample the location of the special token in the sequence. Griffin uses a local attention window of size 128. We show our results in Figure 6. On the Selective Copying task, we find that all 3 models are able to solve the task perfectly. When comparing speed of learning on this task, we find Hawk to be significantly slower than Transformers, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024), where the authors showed that Mamba was significantly slower to learn on similar tasks. Interestingly though, Griffin shows almost no slowdown, effectively matching the speed of learning of Transformers, despite using only a single local attention layer. On the Induction Heads task, while all 3 models can solve the task perfectly up to the training sequence length, our Transformer baseline is not able to extrapolate to longer sequences during evaluation. While our MQA baseline uses RoPE, Gu and Dao (2023) had similar observation for Transformers with a range of positional encodings. We find that Hawk is able to perfectly extrapolate on this task to evaluation sequences several orders of magnitude longer than the training sequence length. Notably, Griffin, with its local attention, also demonstrated exceptional ability to extrapolate on this task. Evaluating pre-trained models We now evaluate whether copying and retrieval capabilities naturally emerge in our pre-trained models. We consider our 7B Hawk and Griffin models and our 6B MQA Transformer baseline, all trained on 300B tokens on the MassiveText dataset. We consider the same phonebook lookup task introduced in Jelassi et al. (2024), where we provide to the model a synthetic phonebook containing names and numbers, and the model is asked to retrieve the correct phone number given a name. The prompt to the model is a phonebook consisting of randomly sampled list of names and numbers of a certain length, followed by two randomly sampled examples of the task, followed by a randomly sampled name from the phonebook for which the model needs to retrieve the correct phone number. From Figure 6(c), we see that while Hawk can do reasonably well on the task for very short phonebook lengths, it fails to memorize and retrieve the correct phone number when the phonebook length grows, similar to the observation made by Jelassi et al. (2024) on the Mamba model's performance on this task. This is not particularly surprising since Hawk uses a small fixed-size state. Our Transformer baseline can almost perfectly solve this task up to the training sequence length, but fails to retrieve the correct phone number for context lengths longer than the training sequence length. Interestingly, Griffin can perfectly solve this task up to a context length that matches its local attention window size of 1024, in spite of using only a single local attention layer. Once the context length is long enough such that the local attention window does not cover the whole phonebook, performance starts to degrade. Griffin is also able to extrapolate better to longer sequence lengths compared to Transformers. While the performance of Griffin is promising for the ability of models with fixed-size state to solve copying and retrieval tasks, our results suggest more work is needed to improve these capabilities for such models. ## 7. Related Works\n\nThe Transformer architecture has become a more scalable alternative to RNNs. Transformers achieve superior scalability through fully parallelized training, contrasting with the inherent limitations of RNNs. Due to their sequential processing structure, classical RNNs suffer from slow training speeds during both forward and backward propagation (Werbos, 1990). To mitigate this issue, researchers have explored alternative RNN-based methods. Notable examples include Quasi-RNNs (Bradbury et al., 2016), which combine convolutions and linear RNNs for greater parallelization, and the use of input-based gating mechanisms to parallelize linear RNN training (Martin and Cundy, 2017). State-space Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for modeling long input sequences. They demonstrated strong performance on tasks from the long-range arena benchmark (Tay et al., 2020), and audio generation (Goel et al., 2022). SSMs successfully integrate concepts from classical state-space models (Kalman, 1960) with those of RNNs. Their reliance on linear recurrences allows for efficient hidden state computation, either through parallel scan operations or convolutions, resulting in training speeds comparable to Transformer models. The S4 (Gu et al., 2021a) model proposed a sophisticated parameterization called normal plus low-rank to diagonalize the recurrence computation. The S4D parametrized the SSM directly with a diagonal state matrix and showed that it performed just as well while being much simpler (Gu et al., 2022). S5 also diagonalized the recurrence, and showed that the recurrence can be computed using the associative scan (Smith et al., 2022). The H3 model (Dao et al., 2022b) generalizes the recurrent interpretation of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Hyena (Poli et al., 2023) uses a similar architecture, but replaces the S4D layer with a global convolution kernel parametrized by an MLP. RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) uses a simpler SSM design with a gating mechanism which allows them to parallelize the computation using a variant of multi-head attention. Orvieto et al. (2023b) systematically analyzed and ablated multiple modifications to standard RNNs. Their finding showed that through better parameterization and initialization simplified linear RNNs (the LRU), perform just as well as other SSMs variants on various long-range tasks. RWKV (Peng et al., 2023) is a recent RNN, shown to be competitive on language modeling tasks, based on another linear attention approximation inspired by the attention-free Transformer (Zhai et al., 2021). Concurrent to our work Gu and Dao\n(2023) developed an SSM architecture called Mamba with an input dependant selection mechanism and showed that it achieves performance comparable to Transformers with efficient inference. Several extensions of Mamba have been proposed (Wang et al., 2024; Zhu et al., 2024) for different applications. An input-dependent gating similar to Mamba was also proposed by Gateloop (Katsch, 2023). Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) offers a computationally efficient approximation of the self-attention mechanism by linearizing the attention, which can be computed recurrently as a linear RNN. While this approach significantly reduces computational cost compared to full attention, it often comes with a trade-off in model performance. Flash Attention (Dao et al., 2022a) improves the training speed of attention on GPUs by making efficient use of the memory hierarchy. Another approach to reducing the computational cost of global attention, which is becoming increasingly more popular, is using sparse-local attention (Child et al., 2019) or sliding window attention (Jiang et al., 2023). ## 8. Conclusion\n\nThis work introduces Hawk; a recurrent model incorporating a novel gated linear recurrent layer, the RG-LRU. We also introduce Griffin; a hybrid model which mixes the RG-LRU layer with local attention. These models demonstrate exceptional language modeling performance across varying scales, with held-out loss exhibiting power-law scaling as compute resources increase. Hawk exceeds the reported performance of Mamba on downstream tasks when trained on half as many tokens, while Griffin slightly exceeds the performance of Llama- 2 when trained on over 6 times fewer tokens. Furthermore, we empirically validate the inference-time advantages of Hawk and Griffin and observe reduced latency and significantly increased throughput compared to our Transformer baselines. Lastly, Hawk and Griffin exhibit the ability to extrapolate on longer sequences than they have been trained on and are capable of efficiently learning to copy and retrieve data over long horizons. These findings strongly suggest that our proposed models offer a powerful and efficient alternative to Transformers with global attention. ## Acknowledgements\n\nWe thank Adam Paszke, Sharad Vikram, Trevor Gale, Sebastian Borgeaud, George Scrivener, Raia Hadsell, Oriol Vinyals, Toby Boyd, Zhifeng Chen, Chris Dyer, Kelvin Xu, Andriy Mnih for their guidance and advice.

The backbone of these FMs are often sequence models, operating on arbitrary sequences of inputs from a wide variety of domains such as language, images, speech, audio, time series, and genomics (Brown et al. 2020; Dosovitskiy et al. 2020; Ismail Fawaz et al. 2019; Oord et al. 2016; Poli et al. 2023; Sutskever, Vinyals, and Quoc V Le 2014). While this concept is agnostic to a particular choice of model architecture, modern FMs are predominantly based on a single type of sequence model: the Transformer (Vaswani et al. 2017) and its core attention layer (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015) The efficacy of self-attention is attributed to its ability to route information densely within a context window, allowing it to model complex data. However, this property brings fundamental drawbacks: an inability to model anything outside of a finite window, and quadratic scaling with respect to the window length. An enormous body of research has appeared on more efficient variants of attention to overcome these drawbacks (Tay, Dehghani, Bahri, et al. 2022), but often at the expense of the very properties that makes it effective. As of yet, none of these variants have been shown to be empirically effective at scale across domains. Recently, structured state space sequence models (SSMs) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021) have emerged as a promising class of architectures for sequence modeling. These models can be interpreted as a combination of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks ( CNNs ), with inspiration from classical state space models (Kalman 1960). This class of models can be computed very efficiently as either a recurrence or convolution, with linear or near-linear scaling in sequence length. Additionally, they have principled mechanisms for modeling long-range dependencies (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020) in certain data modalities, and have dominated benchmarks such as the long Range\n\n[^0]Arena (Tay, Dehghani, Abnar, et al. 2021). Many flavors of SSMs (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; Y. Li et al. 2023; Ma et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) have been successful in domains involving continuous signal data such as audio and vision (Goel et al. 2022; Nguyen, Goel, et al. 2022; Saon, Gupta, and Cui 2023). However, they have been less effective at modeling discrete and information-dense data such as text. We propose a new class of selective state space models, that improves on prior work on several axes to achieve the modeling power of Transformers while scaling linearly in sequence length. Selection Mechanism. First, we identify a key limitation of prior models: the ability to efficiently select data in an input-dependent manner (i.e. focus on or ignore particular inputs). Building on intuition based on important synthetic tasks such as selective copy and induction heads, we design a simple selection mechanism by parameterizing the SSM parameters based on the input. This allows the model to filter out irrelevant information and remember relevant information indefinitely. Hardware-aware Algorithm. This simple change poses a technical challenge for the computation of the model; in fact, all prior SSMs models must be time- and input-invariant in order to be computationally efficient. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that computes the model recurrently with a scan instead of convolution, but does not materialize the expanded state in order to avoid IO access between different levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. The resulting implementation is faster than previous methods both in theory (scaling linearly in sequence length, compared to pseudo-linear for all convolution-based SSMs) and on modern hardware (up to $3 \\times$ faster on A100 GPUs). Architecture. We simplify prior deep sequence model architectures by combining the design of prior SSM architectures (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) with the MLP block of Transformers into a single block, leading to a simple and homogenous architecture design (Mamba) incorporating selective state spaces. Selective SSMs, and by extension the Mamba architecture, are fully recurrent models with key properties that make them suitable as the backbone of general foundation models operating on sequences. (i) High quality: selectivity brings strong performance on dense modalities such as language and genomics. (ii) Fast training and inference: computation and memory scales linearly in sequence length during training, and unrolling the model autoregressively during inference requires only constant time per step since it does not require a cache of previous elements. (iii) Long context: the quality and efficiency together yield performance improvements on real data up to sequence length 1 M . We empirically validate Mamba's potential as a general sequence FM backbone, in both pretraining quality and domainspecific task performance, on several types of modalities and settings:\n\n- Synthetics. On important synthetic tasks such as copying and induction heads that have been proposed as being key to large language models, Mamba not only solves them easily but can extrapolate solutions indefinitely long ( $>1 \\mathrm{M}$ tokens). - Audio and Genomics. Mamba out-performs prior state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi, Hyena, and Transformers on modeling audio waveforms and DNA sequences, both in pretraining quality and downstream metrics (e.g. reducing FID on a challenging speech generation dataset by more than half). In both settings, its performance improves with longer context up to million-length sequences. - Language Modeling. Mamba is the first linear-time sequence model that truly achieves Transformer-quality performance, both in pretraining perplexity and downstream evaluations. With scaling laws up to 1B parameters, we show that Mamba exceeds the performance of a large range of baselines, including very strong modern Transformer training recipes based on LLaMa (Touvron et al. 2023). Our Mamba language model has $5 \\times$ generation throughput compared to Transformers of similar size, and Mamba-3B's quality matches that of Transformers twice its size (e.g. 4 points higher avg. on common sense reasoning compared to Pythia-3B and even exceeding Pythia-7B).

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a\n\n## Selective State Space Model\n\nwith Hardware-aware State Expansion\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-03.jpg?height=535&width=1722&top_left_y=356&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: (Overview.) Structured SSMs independently map each channel (e.g. $D=5$ ) of an input $x$ to output $y$ through a higher dimensional latent state $h($ e.g. $N=4$ ). Prior SSMs avoid materializing this large effective state ( $D N$, times batch size $B$ and sequence length $L$ ) through clever alternate computation paths requiring time-invariance: the ( $\\triangle, A, B, C$ ) parameters are constant across time. Our selection mechanism adds back input-dependent dynamics, which also requires a careful hardware-aware algorithm to only materialize the expanded states in more efficient levels of the GPU memory hierarchy. 1-dimensional function or sequence $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$ through an implicit latent state $h(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates **Structured State Space Models (SSMs)** with Transformer architectures, specifically enhancing the **SwiGluMLP** Global Attention Unit (GAU) to improve performance in several key areas:\n\n## Key Areas of Improvement\n- **Handling Long-Range Dependencies:** Enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently.\n- **In-Context Learning and Copying Abilities:** Improve the model's performance on tasks that require in-context learning and copying.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability:** Maintain or improve the model's efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Useful Information and Insights\n\n### Benefits of SSMs\n- SSMs offer efficient long-range dependency modeling with linear computational complexity, which is a significant advantage over traditional Transformers that have quadratic complexity.\n- SSMs can capture continuous dynamics and long-range interactions more effectively than Transformers, as demonstrated by the Mamba Neural Operator (MNO).\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Hybrid models combining SSMs and Transformers, such as Mamba-2-Hybrid and MambaFormer, have shown promising results by leveraging the strengths of both architectures.

Previous work on using neural models for this task has focused on Chinese; only feature-based models (e.g., using bags of words and topics) have been considered in English. We release a new English legal judgment prediction dataset, containing cases from the European Court of Human Rights. We evaluate a broad variety of neural models on the new dataset, establishing strong baselines that surpass previous feature-based models in three tasks: (1) binary violation classification; (2) multi-label classification; (3) case importance prediction. We also explore if models are biased towards demographic information via data anonymization.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/67 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n48\nF.\n```\n\n#### 3.

However, MQA can lead to quality degradation, and moreover it may not be desirable to train a separate model just for faster inference. We (1) propose a recipe for uptraining existing multi-head language model checkpoints into models with MQA using 5% of original pre-training compute, and (2) introduce grouped-query attention (GQA), a generalization of multi-query attention which uses an intermediate (more than one, less than number of query heads) number of key-value heads.

Incorporating position encoding (PE) makes it possible to address by position, such as attending to the i-th token. However, current PE methods use token counts to derive position, and thus cannot generalize to higher levels of abstraction, such as attending to the i-th sentence. In this paper, we propose a new position encoding method, Contextual Position Encoding (CoPE), that allows positions to be conditioned on context by incrementing position only on certain tokens determined by the model. This allows more general position addressing such as attending to the $i$-th particular word, noun, or sentence. We show that CoPE can solve the selective copy, counting and Flip-Flop tasks where popular position embeddings fail, and improves perplexity on language modeling and coding tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/25 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\n|\n| 1.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Here are the key points and useful information that can guide the researcher:\n\n## Research Goals and Objectives\nThe researcher aims to create a novel LM block that achieves:\n- Low perplexity on corpora\n- High accuracy on downstream tasks\n- Robustness to varied inputs\n- Efficiency in both training and inference\n- Excellent scalability with more data and larger models\n\n### SMART Goals Framework\nTo make these goals actionable, the SMART goals framework can be highly beneficial.\n\n- **Specific**: Define specific areas of improvement, such as \"reduce perplexity by 10% on a specific corpus\" or \"increase accuracy on a particular downstream task by 5%.\"\n- **Measurable**: Set quantifiable metrics, e.g., \"achieve a perplexity score of 10.5 on the validation set\" or \"increase the accuracy on the GLUE benchmark to 92%.\"\n- **Attainable**: Ensure the goals are realistic based on available resources and existing constraints, e.g., \"given the current computational resources, aim to train the model within 6 months.\"\n- **Relevant**: Align the goals with the broader objective of improving language models, e.g., \"improve the model's performance to enhance its applicability in real-world scenarios.\"\n- **Time-bound**: Set deadlines, e.g., \"achieve the specified perplexity and accuracy within the next 12 months.\"\n\n## Research Methodology\nThe choice of research methodology is crucial. Here are some considerations:\n\n### Quantitative vs. Qualitative vs. Mixed Methodology\n- If the research aims to measure specific variables or test hypotheses (e.g., comparing the performance of different LM architectures), a quantitative methodology would be appropriate.\n- If the research is exploratory, aiming to understand the underlying mechanisms or to develop new concepts, qualitative methods might be more suitable.\n\n### Data Collection and Analysis\n- Decide on the type of data to collect (e.g., text corpora, performance metrics) and the sampling strategy (e.g., probability sampling for large-scale datasets).\n- Choose appropriate data analysis methods (e.g., statistical analysis for quantitative data, qualitative content analysis for qualitative data).\n\n## Purpose Statement and Research Questions\n- The purpose statement should clearly outline the objectives and the methodology. It should be specific, focused, and aligned with the research questions.\n- Ensure the purpose statement does not advocate for a particular outcome but rather aims to explore or examine the relationship between variables (e.g., \"The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of different autoregressive LM block architectures on perplexity and accuracy\").\n\n## Alignment with Research Aims and Objectives\n- Every methodological choice should align with the research aims, objectives, and questions. This ensures that the study remains focused and valid.\n\nBy using the SMART goals framework to set clear, actionable objectives and by carefully selecting an appropriate research methodology, the researcher can systematically design a study that is well-aligned with the goal of developing a novel and superior autoregressive LM block.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives.

Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.57)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.57)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

Specifically, Jamba interleaves blocks of Transformer and Mamba layers, enjoying the benefits of both model families. MoE is added in some of these layers to increase model capacity while keeping active parameter usage manageable. This flexible architecture allows resource- and objective-specific configurations. In the particular configuration we have implemented, we end up with a powerful model that fits in a single 80GB GPU. Built at large scale, Jamba provides high throughput and small memory footprint compared to vanilla Transformers, and at the same time state-of-the-art performance on standard language model benchmarks and long-context evaluations. Remarkably, the model presents strong results for up to 256K tokens context length. We study various architectural decisions, such as how to combine Transformer and Mamba layers, and how to mix experts, and show that some of them are crucial in large scale modeling. We also describe several interesting properties of these architectures which the training and evaluation of Jamba have revealed, and plan to release checkpoints from various ablation runs, to encourage further exploration of this novel architecture. We make the weights of our implementation of Jamba publicly available under a permissive license.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/24 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\nF. Gales.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Structural Entropy Guided Graph Hierarchical Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical compression*\n\n*Junran Wu, Xueyuan Chen, Ke Xu, Shangzhe Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, and a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once, which outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Abstract:** Following the success of convolution on non-Euclidean space, the corresponding pooling approaches have also been validated on various tasks regarding graphs. However, because of the fixed compression quota and stepwise pooling design, these hierarchical pooling methods still suffer from local structure damage and suboptimal problem. In this work, inspired by structural entropy, we propose a hierarchical pooling approach, SEP, to tackle the two issues. Specifically, without assigning the layer-specific compression quota, a global optimization algorithm is designed to generate the cluster assignment matrices for pooling at once. Then, we present an illustration of the local structure damage from previous methods in the reconstruction of ring and grid synthetic graphs. In addition to SEP, we further design two classification models, SEP-G and SEP-N for graph classification and node classification, respectively. The results show that SEP outperforms state-of-the-art graph pooling methods on graph classification benchmarks and obtains superior performance on node classifications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2.

Anaraki, Lei Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape, which enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression.\n\n**Abstract:** We present coarse-to-fine autoregressive networks (C2FAR), a method for modeling the probability distribution of univariate, numeric random variables. C2FAR generates a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine discretization of a variable autoregressively; progressively finer intervals of support are generated from a sequence of binned distributions, where each distribution is conditioned on previously-generated coarser intervals. Unlike prior (flat) binned distributions, C2FAR can represent values with exponentially higher precision, for only a linear increase in complexity. We use C2FAR for probabilistic forecasting via a recurrent neural network, thus modeling time series autoregressively in both space and time. C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape. This flexibility enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression. C2FAR achieves improvements over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark forecasting datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical compression*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical compression*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. OTOv3: Automatic Architecture-Agnostic Neural Network Training and Compression from Structured Pruning to Erasing Operators\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical compression*\n\n*Luming Liang, Ilya Zharkov, HsiangTao Wu, Zeyu Chen, Zhihui Zhu, Tianyu Ding, Tianyi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Compressing a predefined deep neural network (DNN) into a compact sub-network with competitive performance is crucial in the efficient machine learning realm. This topic spans various techniques, from structured pruning to neural architecture search, encompassing both pruning and erasing operators perspectives. Despite advancements, existing methods suffers from complex, multi-stage processes that demand substantial engineering and domain knowledge, limiting their broader applications. We introduce the third-generation Only-Train-Once (OTOv3), which first automatically trains and compresses a general DNN through pruning and erasing operations, creating a compact and competitive sub-network without the need of fine-tuning. OTOv3 simplifies and automates the training and compression process, minimizes the engineering efforts required from users. It offers key technological advancements: (i) automatic search space construction for general DNNs based on dependency graph analysis; (ii) Dual Half-Space Projected Gradient (DHSPG) and its enhanced version with hierarchical search (H2SPG) to reliably solve (hierarchical) structured sparsity problems and ensure sub-network validity; and (iii) automated sub-network construction using solutions from DHSPG/H2SPG and dependency graphs. Our empirical results demonstrate the efficacy of OTOv3 across various benchmarks in structured pruning and neural architecture search. OTOv3 produces sub-networks that match or exceed the state-of-the-arts.

This approach can be adapted to GAUs to handle long sequences effectively.\n\n## Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\n\n- The idea of temporal latent bottlenecks, as seen in the **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** work, involves using a dual-stream architecture with fast and slow processing mechanisms. This can be integrated into GAUs to balance expressiveness and computational efficiency, similar to how State Space Models (SSMs) manage state information over time.\n\n## Adaptive State Compression\n\n- Adaptive state compression can be informed by techniques used in **Self-attention Does Not Need O(n\u00b2) Memory**, which reduces memory complexity without sacrificing performance. Additionally, the **Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models** paper proposes a unified post-training token reduction method that integrates token importance and similarity, which can be adapted for adaptive state compression in GAUs.\n\n## Integration with State Space Models\n\n- **Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners** provides a framework where SSMs are treated as learning modules that learn to compress information along the sequence dimension. This perspective can be applied to GAUs to enhance their ability to manage state information efficiently during both training and inference.\n\n## Key Insights\n\n### Hierarchical Processing\n- Hierarchical models like **Hi-transformer** demonstrate that processing at multiple scales can reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance. This can be applied to GAUs to handle long sequences more efficiently.\n\n### Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\n- The dual-stream architecture with fast and slow streams can be integrated into GAUs to manage state information effectively, as seen in the **Temporal Latent Bottleneck** and **Longhorn** papers. This approach helps in balancing expressiveness and computational efficiency.\n\n### Adaptive State Compression\n- Techniques from **Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models** and **Self-attention Does Not Need O(n\u00b2) Memory** can be used to develop adaptive compression strategies within GAUs. These methods focus on reducing memory usage while preserving essential information, which is crucial for maintaining performance.\n\n## Novelty and Potential Performance Improvements\n\n- The specific combination of hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression within GAUs appears to be novel based on the current search results. However, it is essential to conduct more targeted searches to ensure no prior work has already integrated these components in a similar fashion.\n\n- The integration of these components is expected to improve performance metrics such as perplexity and accuracy on downstream tasks by enabling better long-range dependency modeling. Adaptive state compression should also enhance computational efficiency and scalability, making the model more suitable for handling longer sequences without incurring quadratic memory costs.\n\n## Theoretical and Practical Alignment\n\n- The theoretical underpinnings of integrating hierarchical processing with state compression are supported by existing research. Ensuring that the hierarchical and compression mechanisms are mathematically sound and practically implementable within the GAU framework is critical for the proposal's success.\n\n## Future Search Directions\n\n- **Deepening Novelty Assessment**: Conduct targeted searches focusing on the specific integration of hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression within GAUs.\n- **Exploring Related Models and Techniques**: Investigate state space models, adaptive compression in sequence models, and hierarchical processing techniques to inform potential implementation strategies.\n- **Performance Benchmarking and Empirical Studies**: Search for empirical studies comparing hierarchical and compressed GAUs against standard GAUs in terms of perplexity, accuracy, computational efficiency, and memory usage.\n- **Theoretical Foundations and Mathematical Justifications**: Ensure the design aligns with established principles in sequence modeling and state management.\n\n### Relevant References\n\n1. **Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners**:\n   - This paper provides a framework for treating SSMs as learning modules that learn to compress information along the sequence dimension, which can be applied to GAUs.\n\n2. **Rethinking Token Reduction for State Space Models**:\n   - This work proposes a unified post-training token reduction method for SSMs, which can be adapted for adaptive state compression in GAUs.\n\n3. **Hi-transformer: Hierarchical Interactive Transformer for Efficient and Effective Long Document Modeling**:\n   - This paper demonstrates hierarchical processing at multiple scales to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance, which can be applied to GAUs.\n\n4. **Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning**:\n   - This work introduces a dual-stream architecture with fast and slow processing mechanisms, which can be integrated into GAUs to balance expressiveness and computational efficiency.\n\nBy integrating these insights and techniques, the researcher can develop a novel and efficient GAU architecture that leverages hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression to enhance performance and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, there is little understanding of the in-principle abilities of such models, which could provide useful guidance to the search for better LM architectures. We present a comprehensive theoretical study of the capacity of such SSMs as it compares to that of transformers and traditional RNNs. We find that SSMs and transformers have overlapping but distinct strengths. In star-free state tracking, SSMs implement straightforward and exact solutions to problems that transformers struggle to represent exactly. They can also model bounded hierarchical structure with optimal memory even without simulating a stack. On the other hand, we identify a design choice in current SSMs that limits their expressive power. We discuss implications for SSM and LM research, and verify results empirically on a recent SSM, Mamba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/63 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\n# The Expressive Capacity of State Space Models: A Formal Language Perspective \n\nYash Sarrof, Yana Veitsman, Michael Hahn<br>Saarland Informatics Campus<br>Saarland University, Germany<br>\\{ysarrof, yanav, mhahn\\}@lst.uni-saarland.de\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nRecently, recurrent models based on linear state space models (SSMs) have shown promising performance in language modeling (LM), competititve with transformers.\n```\n\n#### 3.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

Toderici*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders that learn approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent representation. The transforms are combined with an entropy model, which is a prior on the latent representation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to generate a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models were introduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than previous fully factorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining end-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in probabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, and combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in the context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive models can incur a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models. The combined model yields state-of-the-art rate\u2013distortion performance and generates smaller files than existing methods: 15.8% rate reductions over the baseline hierarchical model and 59.8%, 35%, and 8.4% savings over JPEG, JPEG2000, and BPG, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first learning-based method to outperform the top standard image codec (BPG) on both the PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 1087  (*Influential: 276*)\n\n#### 4. Autoregressive Search Engines: Generating Substrings as Document Identifiers\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical autoregressive compression*\n\n*Michele Bevilacqua, G. Ottaviano, Patrick Lewis, Wen-tau Yih, Sebastian Riedel, F. Petroni*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an alternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all ngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers, which outperforms prior autoregressive approaches and leads to an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval solutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge-intensive language tasks require NLP systems to both provide the correct answer and retrieve supporting evidence for it in a given corpus. Autoregressive language models are emerging as the de-facto standard for generating answers, with newer and more powerful systems emerging at an astonishing pace. In this paper we argue that all this (and future) progress can be directly applied to the retrieval problem with minimal intervention to the models' architecture. Previous work has explored ways to partition the search space into hierarchical structures and retrieve documents by autoregressively generating their unique identifier. In this work we propose an alternative that doesn't force any structure in the search space: using all ngrams in a passage as its possible identifiers. This setup allows us to use an autoregressive model to generate and score distinctive ngrams, that are then mapped to full passages through an efficient data structure. Empirically, we show this not only outperforms prior autoregressive approaches but also leads to an average improvement of at least 10 points over more established retrieval solutions for passage-level retrieval on the KILT benchmark, establishing new state-of-the-art downstream performance on some datasets, while using a considerably lighter memory footprint than competing systems.

Generating Diverse High-Fidelity Images with VQ-VAE-2\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical autoregressive compression*\n\n*Ali Razavi, Oriol Vinyals, Aaron van den Oord*\n\n**Abstract:** We explore the use of Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) models for large scale image generation. To this end, we scale and enhance the autoregressive priors used in VQ-VAE to generate synthetic samples of much higher coherence and fidelity than possible before. We use simple feed-forward encoder and decoder networks, making our model an attractive candidate for applications where the encoding and/or decoding speed is critical. Additionally, VQ-VAE requires sampling an autoregressive model only in the compressed latent space, which is an order of magnitude faster than sampling in the pixel space, especially for large images. We demonstrate that a multi-scale hierarchical organization of VQ-VAE, augmented with powerful priors over the latent codes, is able to generate samples with quality that rivals that of state of the art Generative Adversarial Networks on multifaceted datasets such as ImageNet, while not suffering from GAN's known shortcomings such as mode collapse and lack of diversity.\n\n**Conference:** generating-diverse-high-fidelity-images-with\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. C2FAR: Coarse-to-Fine Autoregressive Networks for Precise Probabilistic Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: state space hierarchical autoregressive compression*\n\n*Lei Guo, Javad Rahimipour Anaraki, Timothy Zeyl, Shane Bergsma*\n\n**Abstract:** We present coarse-to-fine autoregressive networks (C2FAR), a method for modeling the probability distribution of univariate, numeric random variables. C2FAR generates a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine discretization of a variable autoregressively; progressively finer intervals of support are generated from a sequence of binned distributions, where each distribution is conditioned on previously-generated coarser intervals. Unlike prior (flat) binned distributions, C2FAR can represent values with exponentially higher precision, for only a linear increase in complexity. We use C2FAR for probabilistic forecasting via a recurrent neural network, thus modeling time series autoregressively in both space and time. C2FAR is the first method to simultaneously handle discrete and continuous series of arbitrary scale and distribution shape. This flexibility enables a variety of time series use cases, including anomaly detection, interpolation, and compression. C2FAR achieves improvements over the state-of-the-art on several benchmark forecasting datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher integrate state space models with hierarchical processing and autoregressive compression within Generalized Autoregressive Units (GAUs) for language modeling, here are some key insights and references that align with the proposal's objectives:\n\n## State Space Models (SSMs) and Hierarchical Processing\n\n- **Convolutional State Space Models (ConvSSMs):**\n  - The work on ConvSSMs combines convolutional LSTM with state space methods like S4 and S5, which can be a foundation for integrating hierarchical processing within GAUs.

While attention mechanisms have been effective, they come with quadratic computational complexity and scaling challenges for long sequences. The **SwiGluMLP** GAU in the current architecture, being a standard MLP with SwiGLU activation, primarily captures local interactions and may not efficiently model long-range dependencies.\n\nIntegrating **Structured State Space Models (SSMs)**, specifically **S4 layers**, into the SwiGluMLP GAU offers a promising solution. SSMs are designed to handle long sequences efficiently, modeling dependencies over extended contexts with linear computational complexity. By enhancing the SwiGluMLP with S4 layers, we aim to improve the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies, enhance in-context learning and copying abilities, and maintain efficiency and scalability.\n\n## Related Work\n\nNumerous studies have explored the integration of SSMs with Transformer architectures to address limitations in modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n- **Mamba and Mamba-2**: Gu and Dao (2023) introduced **Mamba**, integrating SSMs into a simplified architecture without attention or MLP blocks. **Mamba-2** refined this approach, achieving competitive performance with Transformers while being more efficient.\n\n- **Hybrid Models**: Waleffe et al. (2024) and Park et al. (2024) demonstrated that hybrid architectures combining SSMs and Transformers, such as **Mamba-2-Hybrid** and **MambaFormer**, outperform pure SSMs and Transformers on various tasks, especially those requiring in-context learning and copying.\n\n- **Block-State Transformers**: Fathi et al. (2023) proposed a hybrid layer that combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization with a Transformer sublayer for short-term representation, showing improved performance on language modeling.\n\n- **Limitations of Pure SSMs**: Jelassi et al. (2024) highlighted that pure SSMs struggle with tasks requiring strong copying abilities, suggesting hybrid architectures as a solution.\n\nThese works inform our proposal by demonstrating the feasibility and benefits of integrating SSMs with existing architectures to enhance performance on tasks involving long sequences.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Limitations of SwiGluMLP\n\n- **Local Interactions**: The SwiGluMLP GAU, utilizing standard MLPs, primarily captures local patterns and lacks mechanisms to model long-range dependencies effectively.\n\n- **In-Context Learning Challenges**: Pure MLPs may not efficiently handle tasks that require the model to learn from the context within the input sequence, such as copying or retrieval tasks.\n\n### Benefits of Integrating S4 Layers\n\n- **Efficient Long-Range Modeling**: S4 layers are designed to model long-range dependencies with linear computational complexity, making them suitable for handling extended contexts.\n\n- **Enhanced Expressiveness**: Combining the nonlinear capabilities of MLPs with the sequential modeling strength of SSMs increases the model's capacity to learn complex patterns.\n\n- **Improved In-Context Learning**: The integration can address the copying and retrieval limitations of pure SSMs by leveraging the strengths of both MLPs and SSMs.\n\n### Potential Trade-offs\n\n- **Implementation Complexity**: Introducing S4 layers increases architectural complexity, requiring careful design to maintain training stability.\n\n- **Computational Overhead**: While S4 layers are efficient for long sequences, they may introduce additional computation compared to standard MLPs for shorter sequences.\n\n- **Training Stability**: SSMs can be sensitive to initialization and hyperparameters, necessitating advanced training techniques.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection SwiGluMLP```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nWe propose enhancing the **SwiGluMLP** GAU by integrating an S4 layer, creating a hybrid module that captures both local and long-range dependencies. The integration is designed to be a localized modification, adhering to the constraints of focusing on a single GAU without affecting other units.\n\n### Architectural Design\n\n#### Sequential Integration\n\nThe S4 layer is placed after the existing SwiGluMLP module within the GAU:\n\n\\[\nY = \\text{S4}(\\text{SwiGluMLP}(X))\n\\]\n\n- **SwiGluMLP Module**: Processes the input \\( X \\) to capture local interactions using the SwiGLU activation function.\n- **S4 Layer**: Models long-range dependencies on the output of the SwiGluMLP.\n\n#### Alternative: Parallel Integration with Fusion\n\nAlternatively, the input is processed through both the SwiGluMLP and S4 layers in parallel, and the outputs are fused:\n\n\\[\nY = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_f [\\text{SwiGluMLP}(X); \\text{S4}(X)] + \\mathbf{b}_f)\n\\]\n\nwhere \\([;]\\) denotes concatenation, \\(\\mathbf{W}_f\\) and \\(\\mathbf{b}_f\\) are learnable parameters, and \\(\\sigma\\) is an activation function.\n\n### Mathematical Formulations\n\n#### SwiGluMLP Module\n\nThe SwiGluMLP computes:\n\n\\[\nH = \\text{SwiGLU}(\\mathbf{XW}_1 + \\mathbf{b}_1)\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\text{SwiGLU}(X) = \\text{Swish}(X[:, :d]) \\odot X[:, d:]\n\\]\n\nwhere \\(\\text{Swish}(x) = x \\cdot \\sigma(\\beta x)\\), \\(\\sigma\\) is the sigmoid function, and \\(d\\) is the dimension size.\n\n#### S4 Layer\n\nAn S4 layer models the sequence using a state-space representation:\n\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathbf{h}_{t+1} & = \\mathbf{A} \\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{B} \\mathbf{x}_t \\\\\n\\mathbf{y}_t & = \\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_t + \\mathbf{D} \\mathbf{x}_t\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\n- \\(\\mathbf{A}, \\mathbf{B}, \\mathbf{C}, \\mathbf{D}\\) are state-space parameters.\n- Efficient algorithms are used to compute the outputs without explicitly iterating over time steps.\n\n#### Fusion Layer (for Parallel Integration)\n\nFuses the outputs from both modules:\n\n\\[\nY = \\sigma(\\mathbf{W}_f [H; S] + \\mathbf{b}_f)\n\\]\n\n- \\(H = \\text{SwiGluMLP}(X)\\)\n- \\(S = \\text{S4}(X)\\)\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n- **Complementary Strengths**: The SwiGluMLP captures local patterns, while the S4 layer models long-range dependencies, providing a comprehensive modeling capability.\n\n- **Efficiency**: S4 layers handle long sequences with linear complexity, mitigating the computational overhead associated with attention mechanisms in Transformers.\n\n- **Expressiveness**: Combining nonlinear activations in MLPs with the sequential processing of SSMs increases the model's capacity.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified SwiGluMLP\n\n```python\nclass S4MLP(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict, \n                 device=None, dtype=None, ssm_hidden_size: int = None, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        \n        #

Discretization parameters (could use learned delta time steps)\n    \n    def forward(self, X):\n        # Assuming batch_first: X shape (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n        batch_size, seq_len, _ = X.size()\n        device = X.device\n        \n        # Efficient computation using convolutional methods or recurrence relations\n        # Placeholder for actual implementation\n        \n        # For illustration, a simple recurrent computation (not efficient)\n        h = torch.zeros(batch_size, self.ssm_size, device=device, dtype=X.dtype)\n        outputs = []\n        \n        for t in range(seq_len):\n            x_t = X[:, t, :]\n            h = torch.matmul(h, self.A.T) + torch.matmul(x_t, self.B.T)\n            y_t = torch.matmul(h, self.C.T) + torch.matmul(x_t, self.D.T)\n            outputs.append(y_t.unsqueeze(1))\n        \n        outputs = torch.cat(outputs, dim=1)\n        return outputs\n```\n\n### Integration Steps\n\n1. **Replace SwiGluMLP with S4MLP**: Substitute the existing SwiGluMLP GAU with the new S4MLP module in the model's block.\n\n2. **Initialize Parameters**: Properly initialize the SSM parameters to ensure training stability.\n\n3. **Training Techniques**:\n\n   - Apply layer normalization within the S4 layer if necessary.\n   - Use gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients due to the recurrent computations in the SSM.\n\n4. **Maintain Interfaces**: Ensure the modified GAU maintains the same input and output dimensions for compatibility with other parts of the model.\n\n### Training Considerations\n\n- **Learning Rate Schedule**: Consider using a learning rate schedule suitable for training models with SSMs.\n\n- **Batch Size**: Experiment with batch sizes to balance computational efficiency and training stability.\n\n- **Regularization**: Apply regularization techniques if necessary to prevent overfitting.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBy integrating an S4 layer into the SwiGluMLP GAU, we enhance the model's ability to capture long-range dependencies efficiently, improving performance on tasks requiring extended context understanding. The proposed modification leverages the strengths of both MLPs and SSMs, combining local pattern recognition with efficient long-range modeling. This integration is designed to be a localized change, adhering to the constraints, and aims to maintain or improve training and inference efficiency, scalability, and overall model performance.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Gu, A., & Dao, T.
