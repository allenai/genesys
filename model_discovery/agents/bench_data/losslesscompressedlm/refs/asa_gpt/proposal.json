In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance.

As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chen Huang, Walter A. Talbott, N. Jaitly, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, this paper learns to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer, and makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise attention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chenwei Xu, Yu-Chao Huang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weijian Li, Ammar Gilani, H. Goan, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The BiSHop framework, a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning, is introduced, demonstrating that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the \\textbf{B}i-Directional \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{Hop}field Network (\\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Sinop*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets.

Adaptively Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*Gon\u00e7alo M. Correia, Vlad Niculae, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns, accomplished by replacing softmax with alpha-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with alpha-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the alpha parameter \u2013 which controls the shape and sparsity of alpha-entmax \u2013 allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 221  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 6. $O(n)$ Connections are Expressive Enough: Universal Approximability of Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*Chulhee Yun, Yin-Wen Chang, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, A. Rawat, Sashank J.

However, these models suffer from quadratic computational cost in the input sequence length $n$ to compute attention in each layer. This has prompted recent research into faster attention models, with a predominant approach involving sparsifying the connections in the attention layers. While empirically promising for long sequences, fundamental questions remain unanswered: Can sparse transformers approximate any arbitrary sequence-to-sequence function, similar to their dense counterparts? How does the sparsity pattern and the sparsity level affect their performance? In this paper, we address these questions and provide a unifying framework that captures existing sparse attention models. Our analysis proposes sufficient conditions under which we prove that a sparse attention model can universally approximate any sequence-to-sequence function. Surprisingly, our results show the existence of models with only $O(n)$ connections per attention layer that can approximate the same function class as the dense model with $n^2$ connections. Lastly, we present experiments comparing different patterns/levels of sparsity on standard NLP tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. ED-Batch: Efficient Automatic Batching of Dynamic Neural Networks via Learned Finite State Machines\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic neural networks*\n\n*Siyuan Chen, Pratik Fegade, Tianqi Chen, Phillip B. Gibbons, T. Mowry*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper provides an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning and finds that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads.\n\n**Abstract:** Batching has a fundamental influence on the efficiency of deep neural network (DNN) execution. However, for dynamic DNNs, efficient batching is particularly challenging as the dataflow graph varies per input instance. As a result, state-of-the-art frameworks use heuristics that result in suboptimal batching decisions. Further, batching puts strict restrictions on memory adjacency and can lead to high data movement costs. In this paper, we provide an approach for batching dynamic DNNs based on finite state machines, which enables the automatic discovery of batching policies specialized for each DNN via reinforcement learning. Moreover, we find that memory planning that is aware of the batching policy can save significant data movement overheads, which is automated by a PQ tree-based algorithm we introduce. Experimental results show that our framework speeds up state-of-the-art frameworks by on average 1.15x, 1.39x, and 2.45x for chain-based, tree-based, and lattice-based DNNs across CPU and GPU.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Broadly, a neural network will be better at learning to execute a reasoning task (in terms of sample complexity) if its individual components align well with the target algorithm. Specifically, GNNs are claimed to align with dynamic programming (DP), a general problem-solving strategy which expresses many polynomial-time algorithms. However, has this alignment truly been demonstrated and theoretically quantified? Here we show, using methods from category theory and abstract algebra, that there exists an intricate connection between GNNs and DP, going well beyond the initial observations over individual algorithms such as Bellman-Ford. Exposing this connection, we easily verify several prior findings in the literature, produce better-grounded GNN architectures for edge-centric tasks, and demonstrate empirical results on the CLRS algorithmic reasoning benchmark. We hope our exposition will serve as a foundation for building stronger algorithmically aligned GNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 53  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 9. Dynamic Graph Neural Networks Under Spatio-Temporal Distribution Shift\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic neural networks*\n\n*Zeyang Zhang, Xin Wang, Ziwei Zhang, Haoyang Li, Zhou Qin, Wenwu Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA), a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns, and proposes an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions.\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic graph neural networks (DyGNNs) have demonstrated powerful predictive abilities by exploiting graph structural and temporal dynamics. However, the existing DyGNNs fail to handle distribution shifts, which naturally exist in dynamic graphs, mainly because the patterns exploited by DyGNNs may be variant with respect to labels under distribution shifts. In this paper, we propose to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and utilizing invariant patterns , i.e., structures and features whose predictive abilities are stable across distribution shifts, which faces two key challenges: 1) How to discover the complex variant and invariant spatio-temporal patterns in dynamic graphs, which involve both time-varying graph structures and node features. 2) How to handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts with the discovered variant and invariant patterns. To tackle these challenges, we propose the Disentangled Intervention-based Dynamic graph Attention networks ( DIDA ). Our proposed method can effectively handle spatio-temporal distribution shifts in dynamic graphs by discovering and fully utilizing invariant spatio-temporal patterns. Specifically, we first propose a disentangled spatio-temporal attention network to capture the variant and invariant patterns. Then, we design a spatio-temporal intervention mechanism to create multiple interventional distributions by sampling and reassembling variant patterns across neighborhoods and time stamps to eliminate the spurious impacts of variant patterns. Lastly, we propose an invariance regularization term to minimize the variance of predictions in intervened distributions so that our model can make predictions based on invariant patterns with stable predictive abilities and therefore handle distribution shifts. Experiments on three real-world datasets and one synthetic dataset demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art baselines under distribution shifts.

Explain and Improve: LRP-Inference Fine-Tuning for Image Captioning\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamei Sun, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the predictions of image captioning models with attention\nmechanisms beyond visualizing the attention itself. We develop variants of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and gradient-based explanation methods,\ntailored to image captioning models with attention mechanisms. We compare the\ninterpretability of attention heatmaps systematically against the explanations\nprovided by explanation methods such as LRP, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM. We\nshow that explanation methods provide simultaneously pixel-wise image\nexplanations (supporting and opposing pixels of the input image) and linguistic\nexplanations (supporting and opposing words of the preceding sequence) for each\nword in the predicted captions. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that\nexplanation methods 1) can reveal additional evidence used by the model to make\ndecisions compared to attention; 2) correlate to object locations with high\nprecision; 3) are helpful to \"debug\" the model, e.g. by analyzing the reasons\nfor hallucinated object words. With the observed properties of explanations, we\nfurther design an LRP-inference fine-tuning strategy that reduces the issue of\nobject hallucination in image captioning models, and meanwhile, maintains the\nsentence fluency.

Explicit Sparse Transformer: Concentrated Attention Through Explicit\n  Selection\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin, Zhiyuan Zhang, Xuancheng Ren, Qi Su, Xu Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention based Transformer has demonstrated the state-of-the-art\nperformances in a number of natural language processing tasks. Self-attention\nis able to model long-term dependencies, but it may suffer from the extraction\nof irrelevant information in the context. To tackle the problem, we propose a\nnovel model called \\textbf{Explicit Sparse Transformer}.

Diffuser: Efficient Transformers with Multi-hop Attention Diffusion for\n  Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*Aosong Feng, Irene Li, Yuang Jiang, Rex Ying*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient Transformers have been developed for long sequence modeling, due to\ntheir subquadratic memory and time complexity. Sparse Transformer is a popular\napproach to improving the efficiency of Transformers by restricting\nself-attention to locations specified by the predefined sparse patterns.\nHowever, leveraging sparsity may sacrifice expressiveness compared to\nfull-attention, when important token correlations are multiple hops away. To\ncombine advantages of both the efficiency of sparse transformer and the\nexpressiveness of full-attention Transformer, we propose \\textit{Diffuser}, a\nnew state-of-the-art efficient Transformer. Diffuser incorporates all token\ninteractions within one attention layer while maintaining low computation and\nmemory costs. The key idea is to expand the receptive field of sparse attention\nusing Attention Diffusion, which computes multi-hop token correlations based on\nall paths between corresponding disconnected tokens, besides attention among\nneighboring tokens. Theoretically, we show the expressiveness of Diffuser as a\nuniversal sequence approximator for sequence-to-sequence modeling, and\ninvestigate its ability to approximate full-attention by analyzing the graph\nexpander property from the spectral perspective. Experimentally, we investigate\nthe effectiveness of Diffuser with extensive evaluations, including language\nmodeling, image modeling, and Long Range Arena (LRA). Evaluation results show\nthat Diffuser achieves improvements by an average of 0.94% on text\nclassification tasks and 2.30% on LRA, with 1.67$\\times$ memory savings\ncompared to state-of-the-art benchmarks, which demonstrates superior\nperformance of Diffuser in both expressiveness and efficiency aspects.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-21T08:13:34Z  (*Updated: 2023-01-31T15:57:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. A Survey on Dynamic Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic neural networks*\n\n*Canwen Xu, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively scaling large Transformer models is a main driver of recent\nadvances in natural language processing. Dynamic neural networks, as an\nemerging research direction, are capable of scaling up neural networks with\nsub-linear increases in computation and time by dynamically adjusting their\ncomputational path based on the input.

Improving Distant Supervised Relation Extraction by Dynamic Neural\n  Network\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic neural networks*\n\n*Yanjie Gou, Yinjie Lei, Lingqiao Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) is usually formulated as a\nproblem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into\nthe predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation\nclasses as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential\nconnection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE). The network adopts a novel dynamic parameter generator that\ndynamically generates the network parameters according to the query entity\ntypes and relation classes. By using this mechanism, the network can\nsimultaneously handle the style shift problem and enhance the prediction\naccuracy for long-tail classes. Through our experimental study, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed method and show that it can achieve superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-15T06:31:13Z  (*Updated: 2019-12-13T04:29:41Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. AOE-Net: Entities Interactions Modeling with Adaptive Attention Mechanism for Temporal Action Proposals Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ngan Le, Minh-Triet Tran, Bhiksha Raj, Kashu Yamazaki, Sang Truong, Khoa Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task, which requires localizing action intervals in an untrimmed video. Intuitively, we as humans, perceive an action through the interactions between actors, relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Despite the significant progress of TAPG, a vast majority of existing methods ignore the aforementioned principle of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e., perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. DSVT: Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer with Rotated Sets\n\n*From Search Query: sparse transformers*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Bernt Schiele, Di He, Sen Wang, Meng Lei, Shaoshuai Shi, Chen Shi, Haiyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing an efficient yet deployment-friendly 3D backbone to handle sparse point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D perception. Compared with the customized sparse convolution, the attention mechanism in Transformers is more appropriate for flexibly modeling long-range relationships and is easier to be deployed in real-world applications. However, due to the sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse points. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a single-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D perception. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local regions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features of all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection, we design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support effective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose an attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and deployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a broad range of 3D perception tasks. More importantly, DSVT can be easily deployed by TensorRT with real-time inference speed (27Hz).

This method dynamically adjusts the attention pattern based on the input, which helps in capturing both local and global dependencies. It also outperforms static sparse attention methods, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, due to its adaptive nature.\n\n### Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe DAAM mechanism, proposed in the Density Adaptive Transformer (DAT) paper, integrates learnable mean and variance into the attention mechanism. This allows the model to dynamically adjust attention based on the input context, enhancing its responsiveness and ability to handle non-stationary data. DAAM uses a multi-head framework with Gaussian normalization, which adapts the attention distribution to the task's specificity.\n\n## Efficient Sparse Attention Implementations\n\n### CASAK-V\nCASAK-V's dynamic sparse attention mechanism is designed to reduce computational complexity while maintaining expressiveness. It uses a dynamic top-k sparse attention approach, which adjusts the sparsity level based on the attention distribution, outperforming static sparse attention methods. This method also includes a mask generation model (MGM) that is crucial for guiding attention and maintaining performance.\n\n### Sparse Transformer\nThe discussion on sparse attention mechanisms in the CASAK-V paper also references the Sparse Transformer, which adaptively selects tokens to attend to, allowing for more flexibility and improved performance compared to static masking techniques.\n\n## Dynamic Architecture Adaptation in Neural Networks\n\n### Adaptive Selection Operator in Bridge Attention\nThe BA-Net paper introduces an adaptive selection operator in the bridge attention model, which optimizes information exchange between different convolutional layers. Although this work is primarily in the context of computer vision, the concept of adaptive selection can be generalized to other domains, including language models, to reduce information redundancy and optimize computation based on input.\n\n### Multi-Head Mixture of Densities Adaptive Attention Mechanism\nThe extended DAAM mechanism incorporates multiple attention heads with Gaussian mixture models, allowing for a more diverse and comprehensive understanding of the input data. This approach enables the model to adapt to different segments of the input tensor in parallel, enhancing robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Balancing Efficiency and Expressiveness\nBoth CASAK-V and DAAM highlight the importance of balancing efficiency with expressiveness. CASAK-V achieves this through dynamic sparse attention, while DAAM uses Gaussian modulation to adjust attention based on input context. These approaches can be integrated into the existing GPT2-style architecture to address the limitations of fixed computation patterns and redundancy in attention computations.\n\n### Adaptive Position Representations\nThe insights from E^2-LLM on position encoding adaptability can be combined with the adaptive attention mechanisms. For instance, incorporating scale-aware modifications in position representations could enhance the model's ability to handle varying input characteristics[Analysis Note #1].\n\nBy integrating these adaptive attention mechanisms, efficient sparse attention implementations, and dynamic architectural adaptations, the researcher can significantly improve the autoregressive language model's performance, efficiency, and adaptability to different input characteristics.\n",

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 41/68 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\ndoi: 10.1147/rd.203.0198.

Salakhutdinov*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2019)\t**Cited by** 3248  (*Influential: 394*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence, which consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have a potential of learning longer-term dependency, but are limited by a fixed-length context in the setting of language modeling. We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nOfir Press and Lior Wolf. 2016.

However, the quadratic complexity of self-attention limit its application on long text. In this paper, adopting a fine-to-coarse attention mechanism on multi-scale spans via binary partitioning (BP), we propose BP-Transformer (BPT for short). BPT yields $O(k\\cdot n\\log (n/k))$ connections where $k$ is a hyperparameter to control the density of attention. BPT has a good balance between computation complexity and model capacity. A series of experiments on text classification, machine translation and language modeling shows BPT has a superior performance for long text than previous self-attention models.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/38 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2307.03170, 2023.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/32 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nShazeer, and Quoc V.

Adaptive Compositional Continual Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter sharing*\n\n*Bin Wu, Jinyuan Fang, Xiangxiang Zeng, Shangsong Liang, Qiang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An A daptive C ompositional Continual Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper focuses on continual meta-learning, where few-shot tasks are heterogeneous and sequentially available. Recent works use a mixture model for meta-knowledge to deal with the heterogeneity. However, these methods suffer from parameter inefficiency caused by two reasons: (1) the underlying assumption of mutual exclusiveness among mixture components hinders sharing meta-knowledge across heterogeneous tasks. (2) they only allow increasing mixture components and cannot adaptively filter out redundant components. In this paper, we pro-pose an A daptive C ompositional Continual M eta-L earning (ACML) algorithm, which employs a compositional premise to associate a task with a subset of mixture components, allowing meta-knowledge sharing among heterogeneous tasks. Moreover, to adaptively adjust the number of mixture components, we propose a component spar-sification method based on evidential theory to filter out redundant components. Experimental results show ACML outperforms strong baselines, showing the effectiveness of our compositional meta-knowledge, and confirming that ACML can adaptively learn meta-knowledge.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Continual Sequence Generation with Adaptive Compositional Modules\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter sharing*\n\n*Yanzhe Zhang, Xuezhi Wang, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules with pseudo experience replay can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Continual learning is essential for real-world deployment when there is a need to quickly adapt the model to new tasks without forgetting knowledge of old tasks. Existing work on continual sequence generation either always reuses existing parameters to learn new tasks, which is vulnerable to catastrophic forgetting on dissimilar tasks, or blindly adds new parameters for every new task, which could prevent knowledge sharing between similar tasks. To get the best of both worlds, in this work, we propose continual sequence generation with adaptive compositional modules to adaptively add modules in transformer architectures and compose both old and new modules for new tasks. We also incorporate pseudo experience replay to facilitate knowledge transfer in those shared modules. Experiment results on various sequences of generation tasks show that our framework can adaptively add modules or reuse modules based on task similarity, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines in terms of both performance and parameter efficiency.

Conditionally Adaptive Multi-Task Learning: Improving Transfer Learning in NLP Using Fewer Parameters & Less Data\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter sharing*\n\n*Jonathan Pilault, Amine Elhattami, C. Pal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing is proposed that is able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Task Learning (MTL) has emerged as a promising approach for transferring learned knowledge across different tasks. However, multi-task learning must deal with challenges such as: overfitting to low resource tasks, catastrophic forgetting, and negative task transfer, or learning interference. Additionally, in Natural Language Processing (NLP), MTL alone has typically not reached the performance level possible through per-task fine-tuning of pretrained models. However, many fine-tuning approaches are both parameter inefficient, e.g. potentially involving one new model per task, and highly susceptible to losing knowledge acquired during pretraining. We propose a novel transformer based architecture consisting of a new conditional attention mechanism as well as a set of task conditioned modules that facilitate weight sharing. Through this construction we achieve more efficient parameter sharing and mitigate forgetting by keeping half of the weights of a pretrained model fixed. We also use a new multi-task data sampling strategy to mitigate the negative effects of data imbalance across tasks. Using this approach we are able to surpass single-task fine-tuning methods while being parameter and data efficient. With our base model, we attain 2.2% higher performance compared to a full fine-tuned BERT large model on the GLUE benchmark, adding only 5.6% more trained parameters per task (whereas naive fine-tuning potentially adds 100% of the trained parameters per task) and needing only 64.6% of the data. We show that a larger variant of our single multi-task model approach performs competitively across 26 NLP tasks and yields state-of-the-art results on a number of test and development sets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 87  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 4.

Capsule networks achieve state of the art on 4 out of 6 datasets, which shows the effectiveness of capsule networks for text classification. We additionally show that capsule networks exhibit significant improvement when transfer single-label to multi-label text classification over strong baseline methods.

Re-Examining Linear Embeddings for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: rotary embeddings optimization*\n\n*Benjamin Letham, R. Calandra, Akshara Rai, E.

A significant challenge in BO is to scale to high-dimensional parameter spaces while retaining sample efficiency. A solution considered in existing literature is to embed the high-dimensional space in a lower-dimensional manifold, often via a random linear embedding. In this paper, we identify several crucial issues and misconceptions about the use of linear embeddings for BO. We study the properties of linear embeddings from the literature and show that some of the design choices in current approaches adversely impact their performance.

The textual and price information were both encoded in the neural network, and it is therefore difficult to apply this approach in situations other than the original framework of the notoriously hard problem of price prediction. In contrast, this paper presents a method to encode the influence of news articles through a vector representation of stocks called a stock embedding. The stock embedding is acquired with a deep learning framework using both news articles and price history. Because the embedding takes the operational form of a vector, it is applicable to other financial problems besides price prediction. As one example application, we show the results of portfolio optimization using Reuters & Bloomberg headlines, producing a capital gain 2.8 times larger than that obtained with a baseline method using only stock price data. This suggests that the proposed stock embedding can leverage textual financial semantics to solve financial prediction problems.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 8. Leveraging Hyperbolic Embeddings for Coarse-to-Fine Robot Design\n\n*From Search Query: rotary embeddings optimization*\n\n*Heng Dong, Junyu Zhang, Chongjie Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel coarse-to-fine method for designing multi-cellular robots and introduces the Hyperbolic Embeddings for Robot Design (HERD) framework, which unifies robots of various granularity within a shared hyperbolic space and leverages a refined Cross-Entropy Method for optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-cellular robot design aims to create robots comprised of numerous cells that can be efficiently controlled to perform diverse tasks. Previous research has demonstrated the ability to generate robots for various tasks, but these approaches often optimize robots directly in the vast design space, resulting in robots with complicated morphologies that are hard to control. In response, this paper presents a novel coarse-to-fine method for designing multi-cellular robots. Initially, this strategy seeks optimal coarse-grained robots and progressively refines them. To mitigate the challenge of determining the precise refinement juncture during the coarse-to-fine transition, we introduce the Hyperbolic Embeddings for Robot Design (HERD) framework. HERD unifies robots of various granularity within a shared hyperbolic space and leverages a refined Cross-Entropy Method for optimization. This framework enables our method to autonomously identify areas of exploration in hyperbolic space and concentrate on regions demonstrating promise. Finally, the extensive empirical studies on various challenging tasks sourced from EvoGym show our approach's superior efficiency and generalization capability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing for Multi-Task Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter sharing*\n\n*Stefano Soatto, Rahul Bhotika, Charless Fowlkes, Avinash Ravichandran, Alessandro Achille, Hao Li, Matthew Wallingford*\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting pre-trained models with broad capabilities has become standard practice for learning a wide range of downstream tasks. The typical approach of fine-tuning different models for each task is performant, but incurs a substantial memory cost. To efficiently learn multiple downstream tasks we introduce Task Adaptive Parameter Sharing (TAPS), a general method for tuning a base model to a new task by adaptively modifying a small, task-specific subset of layers. This enables multi-task learning while minimizing resources used and competition between tasks. TAPS solves a joint optimization problem which determines which layers to share with the base model and the value of the task-specific weights. Further, a sparsity penalty on the number of active layers encourages weight sharing with the base model. Compared to other methods, TAPS retains high accuracy on downstream tasks while introducing few task-specific parameters. Moreover, TAPS is agnostic to the model architecture and requires only minor changes to the training scheme. We evaluate our method on a suite of fine-tuning tasks and architectures (ResNet, DenseNet, ViT) and show that it achieves state-of-the-art performance while being simple to implement.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. Going deeper with Image Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive parameter sharing*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Gabriel Synnaeve, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been recently adapted for large scale image classification, achieving high scores shaking up the long supremacy of convolutional neural networks. However the optimization of image transformers has been little studied so far. In this work, we build and optimize deeper transformer networks for image classification. In particular, we investigate the interplay of architecture and optimization of such dedicated transformers. We make two transformers architecture changes that significantly improve the accuracy of deep transformers. This leads us to produce models whose performance does not saturate early with more depth, for instance we obtain 86.5% top-1 accuracy on Imagenet when training with no external data, we thus attain the current SOTA with less FLOPs and parameters. Moreover, our best model establishes the new state of the art on Imagenet with Reassessed labels and Imagenet-V2 / match frequency, in the setting with no additional training data. We share our code and models.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic Routing for Recommendation at Tmall\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing networks*\n\n*Pipei Huang, Guoliang Kang, Dik Lun Lee, Qiwei Chen, Yuchi Xu, Wei Li, Mengmeng Wu, Huan Zhao, Chao Li, Zhiyuan Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Industrial recommender systems usually consist of the matching stage and the\nranking stage, in order to handle the billion-scale of users and items. The\nmatching stage retrieves candidate items relevant to user interests, while the\nranking stage sorts candidate items by user interests. Thus, the most critical\nability is to model and represent user interests for either stage. Most of the\nexisting deep learning-based models represent one user as a single vector which\nis insufficient to capture the varying nature of user's interests. In this\npaper, we approach this problem from a different view, to represent one user\nwith multiple vectors encoding the different aspects of the user's interests.\nWe propose the Multi-Interest Network with Dynamic routing (MIND) for dealing\nwith user's diverse interests in the matching stage. Specifically, we design a\nmulti-interest extractor layer based on capsule routing mechanism, which is\napplicable for clustering historical behaviors and extracting diverse\ninterests. Furthermore, we develop a technique named label-aware attention to\nhelp learn a user representation with multiple vectors. Through extensive\nexperiments on several public benchmarks and one large-scale industrial dataset\nfrom Tmall, we demonstrate that MIND can achieve superior performance than\nstate-of-the-art methods for recommendation. Currently, MIND has been deployed\nfor handling major online traffic at the homepage on Mobile Tmall App.\n\n**Published:** 2019-04-17\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Moonshine: Speech Recognition for Live Transcription and Voice Commands\n\n*From Search Query: rotary embeddings optimization*\n\n*Pete Warden, James Wang, Guy Nicholson, Manjunath Kudlur, Evan King, Nat Jeffries*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces Moonshine, a family of speech recognition models optimized for live transcription and voice command processing. Moonshine is based on an encoder-decoder transformer architecture and employs Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) instead of traditional absolute position embeddings. The model is trained on speech segments of various lengths, but without using zero-padding, leading to greater efficiency for the encoder during inference time. When benchmarked against OpenAI's Whisper tiny-en, Moonshine Tiny demonstrates a 5x reduction in compute requirements for transcribing a 10-second speech segment while incurring no increase in word error rates across standard evaluation datasets. These results highlight Moonshine's potential for real-time and resource-constrained applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. CoCA: Fusing Position Embedding with Collinear Constrained Attention in Transformers for Long Context Window Extending\n\n*From Search Query: rotary embeddings optimization*\n\n*Yifan Wu, Siqiao Xue, Jianguo Li, Qi Zhang, Wei Jiang, Jing Ye, Shiyi Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention and position embedding are two key modules in transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the potential relationship between them is far from well studied, especially for long context window extending. In fact, anomalous behaviors harming long context extrapolation exist between Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) and vanilla self-attention unveiled by our work. To address this issue, we propose a novel attention mechanism, CoCA (Collinear Constrained Attention). Specifically, we enforce a collinear constraint between $Q$ and $K$ to seamlessly integrate RoPE and self-attention. While only adding minimal computational and spatial complexity, this integration significantly enhances long context window extrapolation ability. We provide an optimized implementation, making it a drop-in replacement for any existing transformer-based models. Extensive experiments show that CoCA performs extraordinarily well in extending context windows. A CoCA-based GPT model, trained with a context length of 512, can seamlessly extend the context window up to 32K (60$\\times$), without any fine-tuning. Additionally, by dropping CoCA in LLaMA-7B, we achieve extrapolation up to 32K within only 2K training length. Our code is publicly available at: https://github.com/codefuse-ai/Collinear-Constrained-Attention\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient parameter sharing, dynamic routing mechanisms, and combining adaptive attention with positional embeddings, here are some key insights and relevant techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Efficient Parameter Sharing in Adaptive Neural Architectures\n\n1. **Weight Sharing in Neural Architecture Search (NAS):**\n   Pham et al.'s work on \"Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing\" highlights the use of weight sharing to accelerate the training process of neural architectures. This method involves sharing weights across different architectures to reduce the computational cost significantly, which can be applied to adaptive neural architectures to make them more efficient.\n\n2. **Adaptive Partial Parameter Sharing:**\n   The \"Kaleidoscope\" approach introduces a novel adaptive partial parameter sharing scheme. This method maintains a single set of common parameters and employs multiple learnable masks to designate the shared parameters, allowing for dynamic adjustment of parameter sharing based on the environment and learning progress. This could be adapted for language models to balance sample efficiency and policy representational capacity.\n\n## Dynamic Routing Mechanisms in Language Models\n\n1. **Dynamic Routing in Adaptive Architectures:**\n   The concept of dynamic routing is closely related to the idea of learnable sparsity patterns and adaptive parameter generation. For instance, the \"Adaptively Sparse Transformers\" use alpha-entmax to achieve context-dependent sparsity patterns, which can be seen as a form of dynamic routing where attention heads adapt based on the input content[Analysis Note #2].\n\n2. **Exphormer and Graph Transformers:**\n   The \"Exphormer\" model uses virtual global nodes and expander graphs to achieve efficient information flow with linear complexity. This approach can be considered a dynamic routing mechanism, as it ensures that information is routed efficiently through the network, maintaining connectivity and reducing computational complexity[Analysis Note #2].\n\n## Combining Adaptive Attention with Positional Embeddings\n\n1. **Rotary Embeddings Optimization:**\n   While the provided sources do not directly discuss combining adaptive attention with rotary embeddings, the concept of adaptive attention mechanisms can be integrated with rotary embeddings. Rotary embeddings are a form of positional encoding that can be optimized alongside adaptive attention mechanisms. For example, using learnable parameters to adjust the rotary embeddings based on the context-dependent sparsity patterns of the attention mechanism could enhance the model's performance[Analysis Note #2].\n\n2. **Multi-head Mixture Approaches:**\n   Multi-head mixture models can be used for parallel adaptation, allowing different attention heads to focus on different aspects of the input. This can be combined with positional embeddings like rotary embeddings to ensure that the model captures both local and global contextual information efficiently[Analysis Note #2].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **MatMamba Architecture:**\n  The MatMamba architecture, which allows for the training of a single elastic model capable of generating hundreds of nested submodels, could be adapted to incorporate dynamic routing and adaptive attention mechanisms. This would enable the model to efficiently process inputs of varying lengths and complexities while maintaining high performance.\n\n- **Reinforcement Learning-based NAS:**\n  Using Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Neural Architecture Search (NAS) can help in discovering optimal architectures that incorporate dynamic routing and adaptive parameter sharing. This approach can lead to more scalable and efficient models, especially when combined with techniques like weight sharing and learnable masks.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and robust, with improved performance in both training and inference phases.\n",

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/62 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nSee https://vicuna.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation language models*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2. A Win-win Deal: Towards Sparse and Robust Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation language models*\n\n*Yuanxin Liu, Fandong Meng, Zheng Lin, JiangNan Li, Peng Fu, Yanan Cao, Weiping Wang, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper conducts extensive experiments with the pre-trained BERT model on three natural language understanding (NLU) tasks and demonstrates thatparse and robust subnetworks (SRNets) can consistently be found in BERT, and explores the upper bound of SRNets using the OOD information.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the remarkable success of pre-trained language models (PLMs), they still face two challenges: First, large-scale PLMs are inefficient in terms of memory footprint and computation. Second, on the downstream tasks, PLMs tend to rely on the dataset bias and struggle to generalize to out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In response to the efficiency problem, recent studies show that dense PLMs can be replaced with sparse subnetworks without hurting the performance. Such subnetworks can be found in three scenarios: 1) the fine-tuned PLMs, 2) the raw PLMs and then fine-tuned in isolation, and even inside 3) PLMs without any parameter fine-tuning. However, these results are only obtained in the in-distribution (ID) setting. In this paper, we extend the study on PLMs subnetworks to the OOD setting, investigating whether sparsity and robustness to dataset bias can be achieved simultaneously. To this end, we conduct extensive experiments with the pre-trained BERT model on three natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. Our results demonstrate that \\textbf{sparse and robust subnetworks (SRNets) can consistently be found in BERT}, across the aforementioned three scenarios, using different training and compression methods. Furthermore, we explore the upper bound of SRNets using the OOD information and show that \\textbf{there exist sparse and almost unbiased BERT subnetworks}. Finally, we present 1) an analytical study that provides insights on how to promote the efficiency of SRNets searching process and 2) a solution to improve subnetworks' performance at high sparsity.

Improving Sharpness-Aware Minimization with Fisher Mask for Better Generalization on Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation language models*\n\n*Qihuang Zhong, Liang Ding, Li Shen, Peng Mi, Juhua Liu, Bo Du, Dacheng Tao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel optimization procedure, namely FSAM, which introduces a Fisher mask to improve the efficiency and performance of SAM, and empirically shows that FSAM works well in other complex scenarios, e.g., fine-tuning on generation tasks or limited training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning large pretrained language models on a limited training corpus usually suffers from poor generalization. Prior works show that the recently-proposed sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) optimization method can improve the model generalization. However, SAM adds a perturbation to each model parameter equally (but not all parameters contribute equally to the optimization of training), which we argue is sub-optimal and will lead to excessive computation. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization procedure, namely FSAM, which introduces a Fisher mask to improve the efficiency and performance of SAM. In short, instead of adding perturbation to all parameters, FSAM uses the Fisher information to identity the important parameters and formulates a Fisher mask to obtain the sparse perturbation, i.e., making the optimizer focus on these important parameters. Experiments on various tasks in GLUE and SuperGLUE benchmarks show that FSAM consistently outperforms the vanilla SAM by 0.67~1.98 average score among four different pretrained models. We also empirically show that FSAM works well in other complex scenarios, e.g., fine-tuning on generation tasks or limited training data. Encouragingly, when training data is limited, FSAM improves the SAM by a large margin, i.e., up to 15.1.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

SHARCS can train a router on any transformer network, enabling the model to direct different samples to sub-networks with varying widths. Our experiments demonstrate that: (1) SHARCS outperforms or complements existing per-sample adaptive inference methods across various classification tasks in terms of accuracy vs. FLOPs; (2) SHARCS generalizes across different architectures and can be even applied to compressed and efficient transformer encoders to further improve their efficiency; (3) SHARCS can provide a 2 times inference speed up at an insignificant drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. The Neural Data Router: Adaptive Control Flow in Transformers Improves Systematic Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive routing transformers*\n\n*R. Csord\u00e1s, Kazuki Irie, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect errors on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite progress across a broad range of applications, Transformers have limited success in systematic generalization. The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing.

Lifelong Sequence Generation with Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic architecture adaptation*\n\n*Chengwei Qin, Shafiq R. Joty, Chen Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA) is proposed, which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Lifelong sequence generation (LSG), a problem in continual learning, aims to continually train a model on a sequence of generation tasks to learn constantly emerging new generation patterns while avoiding the forgetting of previous knowledge. Existing LSG methods mainly focus on maintaining old knowledge while paying little attention to knowledge transfer across tasks. In contrast, humans can better learn new tasks by leveraging previously acquired knowledge from similar tasks. Inspired by the learning paradigm of humans, we propose Dynamic Module Expansion and Adaptation (DMEA), which enables the model to dynamically determine the architecture for acquiring new knowledge based on task correlation and select the most similar previous tasks to facilitate adaptation to new tasks. In addition, as the learning process can easily be biased towards the current task which might cause more severe forgetting of previously learned knowledge, we propose dynamic gradient scaling to balance the learning of the current task and replayed tasks. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that DMEA can consistently outperform existing methods in different LSG settings.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. DADA: Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation of Linguistic Rules\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic architecture adaptation*\n\n*Yanchen Liu, William B. Held, Diyi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes DADA (Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation), a modular approach to imbue SAE-trained models with multi-dialectal robustness by composing adapters which handle specific linguistic features.\n\n**Abstract:** Existing large language models (LLMs) that mainly focus on Standard American English (SAE) often lead to significantly worse performance when being applied to other English dialects. While existing mitigations tackle discrepancies for individual target dialects, they assume access to high-accuracy dialect identification systems. The boundaries between dialects are inherently flexible, making it difficult to categorize language into discrete predefined categories. In this paper, we propose DADA (Dialect Adaptation via Dynamic Aggregation), a modular approach to imbue SAE-trained models with multi-dialectal robustness by composing adapters which handle specific linguistic features. The compositional architecture of DADA allows for both targeted adaptation to specific dialect variants and simultaneous adaptation to various dialects. We show that DADA is effective for both single task and instruction finetuned language models, offering an extensible and interpretable framework for adapting existing LLMs to different English dialects.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Analogous to Evolutionary Algorithm: Designing a Unified Sequence Model\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic architecture adaptation*\n\n*Jiangning Zhang, Chao Xu, Jian Li, Wenzhou Chen, Yabiao Wang, Ying Tai, Shuo Chen, Chengjie Wang, Feiyue Huang, Yong Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work improves the existing transformer structure and proposes a more efficient EAT model, introduces the spatial-filling curve into the current vision transformer to sequence image data into a uniform sequential format, and designs task-related heads to deal with different tasks more flexibly.\n\n**Abstract:** Inspired by biological evolution, we explain the rationality of Vision Transformer by analogy with the proven practical Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) and derive that both of them have consistent mathematical representation. Analogous to the dynamic local population in EA, we improve the existing transformer structure and propose a more efficient EAT model, and design task-related heads to deal with different tasks more flexibly. Moreover, we introduce the spatial-filling curve into the current vision transformer to sequence image data into a uniform sequential format. Thus we can design a unified EAT framework to address multi-modal tasks, separating the network architecture from the data format adaptation. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on the ImageNet classification task compared with recent vision transformer works while having smaller parameters and greater throughput. We further conduct multi-model tasks to demonstrate the superiority of the unified EAT, e.g., Text-Based Image Retrieval, and our approach improves the rank-1 by +3.7 points over the baseline on the CSS dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation language models*\n\n*Noam Shazeer, Barret Zoph, William Fedus*\n\n**Abstract:** In deep learning, models typically reuse the same parameters for all inputs. Mixture of Experts (MoE) defies this and instead selects different parameters for each incoming example. The result is a sparsely-activated model -- with outrageous numbers of parameters -- but a constant computational cost. However, despite several notable successes of MoE, widespread adoption has been hindered by complexity, communication costs and training instability -- we address these with the Switch Transformer. We simplify the MoE routing algorithm and design intuitive improved models with reduced communication and computational costs. Our proposed training techniques help wrangle the instabilities and we show large sparse models may be trained, for the first time, with lower precision (bfloat16) formats. We design models based off T5-Base and T5-Large to obtain up to 7x increases in pre-training speed with the same computational resources. These improvements extend into multilingual settings where we measure gains over the mT5-Base version across all 101 languages. Finally, we advance the current scale of language models by pre-training up to trillion parameter models on the \"Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus\" and achieve a 4x speedup over the T5-XXL model.\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Costa-juss\u00e0, NLLB team*\n\n**Abstract:** Driven by the goal of eradicating language barriers on a global scale, machine translation has solidified itself as a key focus of artificial intelligence research today. However, such efforts have coalesced around a small subset of languages, leaving behind the vast majority of mostly low-resource languages. What does it take to break the 200 language barrier while ensuring safe, high quality results, all while keeping ethical considerations in mind? In No Language Left Behind, we took on this challenge by first contextualizing the need for low-resource language translation support through exploratory interviews with native speakers. Then, we created datasets and models aimed at narrowing the performance gap between low and high-resource languages. More specifically, we developed a conditional compute model based on Sparsely Gated Mixture of Experts that is trained on data obtained with novel and effective data mining techniques tailored for low-resource languages. We propose multiple architectural and training improvements to counteract overfitting while training on thousands of tasks. Critically, we evaluated the performance of over 40,000 different translation directions using a human-translated benchmark, Flores-200, and combined human evaluation with a novel toxicity benchmark covering all languages in Flores-200 to assess translation safety. Our model achieves an improvement of 44% BLEU relative to the previous state-of-the-art, laying important groundwork towards realizing a universal translation system. Finally, we open source all contributions described in this work, accessible at https://github.com/facebookresearch/fairseq/tree/nllb.\n\n**Conference:** no-language-left-behind-scaling-human\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive routing transformers*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning Dynamic Routing for Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive routing transformers*\n\n*Xingang Wang, Xiangyu Zhang, Zeming Li, Yukang Chen, Yanwei Li, Lin Song, Jian Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, numerous handcrafted and searched networks have been applied for semantic segmentation. However, previous works intend to handle inputs with various scales in pre-defined static architectures, such as FCN, U-Net, and DeepLab series. This paper studies a conceptually new method to alleviate the scale variance in semantic representation, named dynamic routing. The proposed framework generates data-dependent routes, adapting to the scale distribution of each image. To this end, a differentiable gating function, called soft conditional gate, is proposed to select scale transform paths on the fly. In addition, the computational cost can be further reduced in an end-to-end manner by giving budget constraints to the gating function. We further relax the network level routing space to support multi-path propagations and skip-connections in each forward, bringing substantial network capacity. To demonstrate the superiority of the dynamic property, we compare with several static architectures, which can be modeled as special cases in the routing space. Extensive experiments are conducted on Cityscapes and PASCAL VOC 2012 to illustrate the effectiveness of the dynamic framework.

Ever Evolving Evaluator (EV3): Towards Flexible and Reliable Meta-Optimization for Knowledge Distillation\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic architecture adaptation*\n\n*Maryam Karimzadehgan, Guy Tennenholtz, Masrour Zoghi, Li Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce EV3, a novel meta-optimization framework designed to efficiently train scalable machine learning models through an intuitive explore-assess-adapt protocol. In each iteration of EV3, we explore various model parameter updates, assess them using pertinent evaluation methods, and then adapt the model based on the optimal updates and previous progress history. EV3 offers substantial flexibility without imposing stringent constraints like differentiability on the key objectives relevant to the tasks of interest, allowing for exploratory updates with intentionally-biased gradients and through a diversity of losses and optimizers. Additionally, the assessment phase provides reliable safety controls to ensure robust generalization, and can dynamically prioritize tasks in scenarios with multiple objectives. With inspiration drawn from evolutionary algorithms, meta-learning, and neural architecture search, we investigate an application of EV3 to knowledge distillation. Our experimental results illustrate EV3's capability to safely explore the modeling landscape, while hinting at its potential applicability across numerous domains due to its inherent flexibility and adaptability. Finally, we provide a JAX implementation of EV3, along with source code for experiments, available at: https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/ev3.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. Selective Kernel Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic architecture adaptation*\n\n*Xiang Li, Jian Yang, Xiaolin Hu, Wenhai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive fields of\nartificial neurons in each layer are designed to share the same size. It is\nwell-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of\nvisual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely\nconsidered in constructing CNNs. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in\nCNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size\nbased on multiple scales of input information. A building block called\nSelective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with\ndifferent kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the\ninformation in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield\ndifferent sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion\nlayer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel\nNetworks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show\nthat SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower\nmodel complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture\ntarget objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons\nfor adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.\nThe code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/SKNet.\n\n**Conference:** selective-kernel-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design focusing on efficient implementations of sparse computation, combining adaptive routing with transformer architectures, and dynamic architecture adaptation, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Sparse Computation in Language Models\n\n- **Block Sparse Attention**: This approach, introduced by the MIT HAN Lab, incorporates various sparse attention patterns, including streaming attention with token and block granularity, and block-sparse attention. This significantly reduces the computational costs of large language models (LLMs), enhancing their efficiency and scalability.\n\n- **Training-Free Activation Sparsity (TEAL)**: This method applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the entire model without requiring additional training. It achieves 40-50% model-wide sparsity with minimal performance degradation, which is crucial for resource-constrained settings.\n\n- **HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention Acceleration**: This method leverages the inherent sparsity within attention mechanisms using a Half-Space Reporting (HSR) data structure. It significantly reduces the running time complexity for attention generation and full attention computation, particularly in long-context scenarios, with negligible error.\n\n## Methods for Combining Adaptive Routing with Transformer Architectures\n\n- **XMoE: Sparse Models with Fine-grained and Adaptive Expert Selection**: This approach enhances the efficacy and efficiency of sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models by using small experts and a threshold-based router. This allows tokens to selectively engage only essential parameters, reducing computational load by over 50% without sacrificing performance. This method can be applied to both sparse and dense models during inference.\n\n- **SHARCS**: This method involves training a router on any transformer network to direct different samples to sub-networks with varying widths. It can provide a 2 times inference speed up with an insignificant drop in accuracy, demonstrating the benefits of adaptive routing in transformer architectures[Analysis Note #3, Reference SHARCS].\n\n## Dynamic Architecture Adaptation Techniques for Neural Networks\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Sharing and Routing Mechanisms**: Techniques like SHARCS enable the model to adapt by routing different samples to sub-networks of varying widths. This dynamic adaptation can significantly improve efficiency without major accuracy loss[Analysis Note #3, Reference SHARCS].\n\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)**: This technique, as seen in SeqBoat, sparsely activates a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on state representations. It can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, demonstrating efficient dynamic architecture adaptation[Analysis Note #3, Reference Sparse Modular Activation].\n\n- **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models**: MoE models, such as XMoE, decouple parameter count from computational footprint by selectively activating experts based on input tokens.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/46 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn Aistats, volume 5, pages 246-252.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/28 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.00752, 2023.

SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: sparse training dense inference*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper, A. Gholami, Zhen Dong, Xiuyu Li, Sheng Shen, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint, demonstrates that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: sparse training dense inference*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse DST method, Structured RigL (SRigL), to learn a variant of fine-grained structured N:M sparsity by imposing a constant fan-in constraint. Using our empirical analysis of existing DST methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables SRigL to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured DST performance on a variety of Neural Network (NN) architectures. Using a 90% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4x/2.5x on CPU for online inference and 1.7x/13.0x on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

However, in the presence of many downstream tasks, fine-tuning is parameter inefficient: an entire new model is required for every task. As an alternative, we propose transfer with adapter modules. Adapter modules yield a compact and extensible model; they add only a few trainable parameters per task, and new tasks can be added without revisiting previous ones. The parameters of the original network remain fixed, yielding a high degree of parameter sharing. To demonstrate adapter's effectiveness, we transfer the recently proposed BERT Transformer model to 26 diverse text classification tasks, including the GLUE benchmark. Adapters attain near state-of-the-art performance, whilst adding only a few parameters per task. On GLUE, we attain within 0.4% of the performance of full fine-tuning, adding only 3.6% parameters per task. By contrast, fine-tuning trains 100% of the parameters per task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3464  (*Influential: 601*)\n\n#### 6. Let's Sample Step by Step: Adaptive-Consistency for Efficient Reasoning and Coding with LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive initialization techniques*\n\n*Pranjal Aggarwal, Aman Madaan, Yiming Yang, Mausam*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive-Consistency is introduced, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion that reduces sample budget by up to 7.9 times with an average accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.\n\n**Abstract:** A popular approach for improving the correctness of output from large language models (LLMs) is Self-Consistency - poll the LLM multiple times and output the most frequent solution. Existing Self-Consistency techniques always generate a constant number of samples per question, where a better approach will be to non-uniformly distribute the available budget based on the amount of agreement in the samples generated so far. In response, we introduce Adaptive-Consistency, a cost-efficient, model-agnostic technique that dynamically adjusts the number of samples per question using a lightweight stopping criterion. Our experiments over 17 reasoning and code generation datasets and three LLMs demonstrate that Adaptive-Consistency reduces sample budget by up to 7.9 times with an average accuracy drop of less than 0.1%.

Federated Learning of Large Language Models with Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning and Adaptive Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive initialization techniques*\n\n*Tianshi Che, Ji Liu, Yang Zhou, Jiaxiang Ren, Jiwen Zhou, Victor S. Sheng, H. Dai, D. Dou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs and a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm to enable collaborative model training with decentralized data. However, the training process of Large Language Models (LLMs) generally incurs the update of significant parameters, which limits the applicability of FL techniques to tackle the LLMs in real scenarios. Prompt tuning can significantly reduce the number of parameters to update, but it either incurs performance degradation or low training efficiency. The straightforward utilization of prompt tuning in the FL often raises non-trivial communication costs and dramatically degrades performance. In addition, the decentralized data is generally non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID), which brings client drift problems and thus poor performance. This paper proposes a Parameter-efficient prompt Tuning approach with Adaptive Optimization, i.e., FedPepTAO, to enable efficient and effective FL of LLMs. First, an efficient partial prompt tuning approach is proposed to improve performance and efficiency simultaneously. Second, a novel adaptive optimization method is developed to address the client drift problems on both the device and server sides to enhance performance further.

Improved Online Conformal Prediction via Strongly Adaptive Online Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive initialization techniques*\n\n*Aadyot Bhatnagar, Haiquan Wang, Caiming Xiong, Yu Bai*\n\n**TL;DR:** New online conformal prediction methods are developed that minimize the strongly adaptive regret, which measures the worst-case regret over all intervals of a fixed length, and it is proved that these methods consistently obtain better coverage and smaller prediction sets than existing methods on real-world tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of uncertainty quantification via prediction sets, in an online setting where the data distribution may vary arbitrarily over time. Recent work develops online conformal prediction techniques that leverage regret minimization algorithms from the online learning literature to learn prediction sets with approximately valid coverage and small regret. However, standard regret minimization could be insufficient for handling changing environments, where performance guarantees may be desired not only over the full time horizon but also in all (sub-)intervals of time. We develop new online conformal prediction methods that minimize the strongly adaptive regret, which measures the worst-case regret over all intervals of a fixed length. We prove that our methods achieve near-optimal strongly adaptive regret for all interval lengths simultaneously, and approximately valid coverage. Experiments show that our methods consistently obtain better coverage and smaller prediction sets than existing methods on real-world tasks, such as time series forecasting and image classification under distribution shift.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DeepSpeed-MoE: Advancing Mixture-of-Experts Inference and Training to Power Next-Generation AI Scale\n\n*From Search Query: sparse training dense inference*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Jeff Rasley, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Minjia Zhang, Zhewei Yao, Conglong Li, Samyam Rajbhandari*\n\n**Abstract:** As the training of giant dense models hits the boundary on the availability and capability of the hardware resources today, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models become one of the most promising model architectures due to their significant training cost reduction compared to a quality-equivalent dense model. Its training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works) to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly optimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared to existing MoE inference solutions. DeepSpeed-MoE offers an unprecedented scale and efficiency to serve massive MoE models with up to 4.5x faster and 9x cheaper inference compared to quality-equivalent dense models. We hope our innovations and systems help open a promising path to new directions in the large model landscape, a shift from dense to sparse MoE models, where training and deploying higher-quality models with fewer resources becomes more widely possible.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: sparse training dense inference*\n\n*Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the speed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse Mixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficient Neural Architecture Search via Parameter Sharing\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter sharing*\n\n*Melody Y. Guan, Quoc V. Le, Barret Zoph, Jeff Dean, Hieu Pham*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Efficient Neural Architecture Search (ENAS), a fast and\ninexpensive approach for automatic model design. In ENAS, a controller learns\nto discover neural network architectures by searching for an optimal subgraph\nwithin a large computational graph. The controller is trained with policy\ngradient to select a subgraph that maximizes the expected reward on the\nvalidation set. Meanwhile the model corresponding to the selected subgraph is\ntrained to minimize a canonical cross entropy loss. Thanks to parameter sharing\nbetween child models, ENAS is fast: it delivers strong empirical performances\nusing much fewer GPU-hours than all existing automatic model design approaches,\nand notably, 1000x less expensive than standard Neural Architecture Search. On\nthe Penn Treebank dataset, ENAS discovers a novel architecture that achieves a\ntest perplexity of 55.8, establishing a new state-of-the-art among all methods\nwithout post-training processing. On the CIFAR-10 dataset, ENAS designs novel\narchitectures that achieve a test error of 2.89%, which is on par with NASNet\n(Zoph et al., 2018), whose test error is 2.65%.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter sharing*\n\n*James Henderson, Mostafa Dehghani, Sebastian Ruder, Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Characterizing signal propagation to close the performance gap in unnormalized ResNets\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive initialization techniques*\n\n*Samuel L. Smith, Soham De, Andrew Brock*\n\n**Abstract:** Batch Normalization is a key component in almost all state-of-the-art image classifiers, but it also introduces practical challenges: it breaks the independence between training examples within a batch, can incur compute and memory overhead, and often results in unexpected bugs. Building on recent theoretical analyses of deep ResNets at initialization, we propose a simple set of analysis tools to characterize signal propagation on the forward pass, and leverage these tools to design highly performant ResNets without activation normalization layers. Crucial to our success is an adapted version of the recently proposed Weight Standardization. Our analysis tools show how this technique preserves the signal in networks with ReLU or Swish activation functions by ensuring that the per-channel activation means do not grow with depth. Across a range of FLOP budgets, our networks attain performance competitive with the state-of-the-art EfficientNets on ImageNet.\n\n**Conference:** characterizing-signal-propagation-to-close\n\n**Published:** 2021-01-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Generalized End-to-End Loss for Speaker Verification\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive initialization techniques*\n\n*Alan Papir, Li Wan, Ignacio Lopez Moreno, Quan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new loss function called generalized end-to-end (GE2E) loss, which makes the training of speaker verification models more efficient than our previous tuple-based end-to-end (TE2E) loss function. Unlike TE2E, the GE2E loss function updates the network in a way that emphasizes examples that are difficult to verify at each step of the training process. Additionally, the GE2E loss does not require an initial stage of example selection. With these properties, our model with the new loss function decreases speaker verification EER by more than 10%, while reducing the training time by 60% at the same time. We also introduce the MultiReader technique, which allows us to do domain adaptation - training a more accurate model that supports multiple keywords (i.e. \"OK Google\" and \"Hey Google\") as well as multiple dialects.\n\n**Published:** 2017-10-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design using the specified keywords and details, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Methods for Combining Sparse Training with Dense Inference\n\n- The concept of **Switchable Sparse-Dense Learning (SSD)** is particularly relevant. This method adaptively switches between sparse training using Mixture of Experts (MoE) and dense training during the pre-training process. SSD leverages the efficiency of sparse training while avoiding the static activation correlation of sparse training, achieving comparable performance to dense models with up to 2 times faster inference speed.\n\n- **Mixture of Experts (MoE)** models also offer a way to combine sparse training with dense inference. In MoE, only a subset of experts (sparse parameters) is activated during inference, while the entire model (including all experts) is loaded. This approach allows for more parameters to be used during training but reduces the computational cost during inference.\n\n## Efficient Parameter Sharing Techniques in Adaptive Architectures\n\n- **Dynamic Sparse Training (DST)** is a promising approach that maintains a fraction of the parameters throughout the training process. DST dynamically updates the topology of the sparse network, optimizing both weight values and connectivity. This method can improve training and inference efficiency while preserving accuracy, and it involves efficient parameter sharing by dynamically adjusting the network's sparsity.\n\n- **SHARCS** (Efficient Transformers through Routing with Dynamic Width Sub-networks) demonstrates efficient parameter sharing by training a router to direct different samples to sub-networks with varying widths. This approach can provide a significant speedup in inference without a substantial drop in accuracy, highlighting the effectiveness of dynamic width selection and efficient parameter sharing[Analysis Note #4, Reference].\n\n## Strategies for Adaptive Initialization and Parameter Updates\n\n- **Adaptive Expert Selection in MoE Models**: The routing mechanism in MoE models is crucial for adaptive initialization and parameter updates. The router (or gate network) is trained to choose which expert to use for a given token, ensuring that different experts are utilized based on the input characteristics. This adaptive selection helps in load balancing and prevents overfitting on the same experts.\n\n- **Dynamic Sparse Training (DST)** also involves adaptive parameter updates. DST starts with a sparse neural network and simultaneously optimizes both its weight values and connectivity. The parameters are updated through a remove-regrow process based on criteria like gradient information, which helps in maintaining a balanced and efficient network.\n\n- **Switchable Sparse-Dense Learning (SSD)** incorporates adaptive initialization by leveraging the sparse activation properties of Transformers during pre-training. SSD adaptively switches between sparse and dense training, which helps in maintaining the efficiency of sparse training while avoiding the limitations of static sparse activation.\n\nThese approaches and techniques can help in designing an autoregressive language model that combines the benefits of sparse training with the performance of dense inference, while ensuring efficient parameter sharing and adaptive initialization and parameter updates.\n",

PanGu-\u03c0: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation (Avg.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/38 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nAssociation for Computing Machinery.

Score: 0.96)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/30 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2304.07327, 2023.

AutoMoE: Heterogeneous Mixture-of-Experts with Adaptive Computation for Efficient Neural Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Ganesh Jawahar, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Xiaodong Liu, Young Jin Kim, Muhammad Abdul-Mageed, L. Lakshmanan, A. Awadallah, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** AutoMoE is developed -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints and leverages Neural Architecture Search to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in Neural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a homogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed uniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not consider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their design. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing heterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with 4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed Transformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1 BLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for NMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer modules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their sizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations are used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from routing decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

Scaling Vision with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*C. Riquelme, J.

Houlsby*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks, when applied to image recognition, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated Mixture of Experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated excellent scalability in Natural Language Processing. In Computer Vision, however, almost all performant networks are\"dense\", that is, every input is processed by every parameter. We present a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks. When applied to image recognition, V-MoE matches the performance of state-of-the-art networks, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time. Further, we propose an extension to the routing algorithm that can prioritize subsets of each input across the entire batch, leading to adaptive per-image compute. This allows V-MoE to trade-off performance and compute smoothly at test-time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of V-MoE to scale vision models, and train a 15B parameter model that attains 90.35% on ImageNet.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 447  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 3. Meta-DMoE: Adapting to Domain Shift by Meta-Distillation from Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Tao Zhong, Zhixiang Chi, Li Gu, Yang Wang, Yuanhao Yu, Jingshan Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel framework for unsupervised test-time adaptation, which is formulated as a knowledge distillation process to address domain shift and incorporates Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) as teachers, where each expert is separately trained on different source domains to maximize their specialty.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we tackle the problem of domain shift. Most existing methods perform training on multiple source domains using a single model, and the same trained model is used on all unseen target domains. Such solutions are sub-optimal as each target domain exhibits its own specialty, which is not adapted. Furthermore, expecting single-model training to learn extensive knowledge from multiple source domains is counterintuitive. The model is more biased toward learning only domain-invariant features and may result in negative knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel framework for unsupervised test-time adaptation, which is formulated as a knowledge distillation process to address domain shift. Specifically, we incorporate Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) as teachers, where each expert is separately trained on different source domains to maximize their specialty. Given a test-time target domain, a small set of unlabeled data is sampled to query the knowledge from MoE. As the source domains are correlated to the target domains, a transformer-based aggregator then combines the domain knowledge by examining the interconnection among them. The output is treated as a supervision signal to adapt a student prediction network toward the target domain. We further employ meta-learning to enforce the aggregator to distill positive knowledge and the student network to achieve fast adaptation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art and validates the effectiveness of each proposed component.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*J. Puigcerver, C. Riquelme, Basil Mustafa, N. Houlsby*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses challenges of training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without significant increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Furthermore, Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40x more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 6. Codebook Features: Sparse and Discrete Interpretability for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*Alex Tamkin, Mohammad Taufeeque, Noah D. Goodman*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies codes in Transformer language models representing diverse, disentangled concepts and finds that they can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference, and appears to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.\n\n**Abstract:** Understanding neural networks is challenging in part because of the dense, continuous nature of their hidden states. We explore whether we can train neural networks to have hidden states that are sparse, discrete, and more interpretable by quantizing their continuous features into what we call codebook features. Codebook features are produced by finetuning neural networks with vector quantization bottlenecks at each layer, producing a network whose hidden features are the sum of a small number of discrete vector codes chosen from a larger codebook. Surprisingly, we find that neural networks can operate under this extreme bottleneck with only modest degradation in performance. This sparse, discrete bottleneck also provides an intuitive way of controlling neural network behavior: first, find codes that activate when the desired behavior is present, then activate those same codes during generation to elicit that behavior. We validate our approach by training codebook Transformers on several different datasets. First, we explore a finite state machine dataset with far more hidden states than neurons. In this setting, our approach overcomes the superposition problem by assigning states to distinct codes, and we find that we can make the neural network behave as if it is in a different state by activating the code for that state. Second, we train Transformer language models with up to 410M parameters on two natural language datasets. We identify codes in these models representing diverse, disentangled concepts (ranging from negative emotions to months of the year) and find that we can guide the model to generate different topics by activating the appropriate codes during inference. Overall, codebook features appear to be a promising unit of analysis and control for neural networks and interpretability.

Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Kaizhao Liang, Jiaming Yang, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 8. On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Ji Lin, Ligeng Zhu, Wei-Ming Chen, Wei-Chen Wang, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW.\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

STEP: Learning N: M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Chris De Sa, A. Yazdanbakhsh*\n\n**TL;DR:** STEP is proposed, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N: M masks (mask-learning phase).\n\n**Abstract:** Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. A Hierarchical Transformer for Unsupervised Parsing\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Ashok Thillaisundaram*\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying structure of natural language is hierarchical; words combine\ninto phrases, which in turn form clauses. An awareness of this hierarchical\nstructure can aid machine learning models in performing many linguistic tasks.\nHowever, most such models just process text sequentially and there is no bias\ntowards learning hierarchical structure encoded into their architecture. In\nthis paper, we extend the recent transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) by\nenabling it to learn hierarchical representations. To achieve this, we adapt\nthe ordering mechanism introduced in Shen et al., 2018, to the self-attention\nmodule of the transformer architecture. We train our new model on language\nmodelling and then apply it to the task of unsupervised parsing.

DeFINE can be incorporated easily in new or existing sequence models.\nCompared to state-of-the-art methods including adaptive input representations,\nthis technique results in a 6% to 20% drop in perplexity. On WikiText-103,\nDeFINE reduces the total parameters of Transformer-XL by half with minimal\nimpact on performance. On the Penn Treebank, DeFINE improves AWD-LSTM by 4\npoints with a 17% reduction in parameters, achieving comparable performance to\nstate-of-the-art methods with fewer parameters.

Revisiting SMoE Language Models by Evaluating Inefficiencies with Task\n  Specific Expert Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*Soumajyoti Sarkar, Leonard Lausen, Volkan Cevher, Sheng Zha, Thomas Brox, George Karypis*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture of Expert (SMoE) models have emerged as a scalable alternative\nto dense models in language modeling. These models use conditionally activated\nfeedforward subnetworks in transformer blocks, allowing for a separation\nbetween total model parameters and per-example computation. However, large\ntoken-routed SMoE models face a significant challenge: during inference, the\nentire model must be used for a sequence or a batch, resulting in high\nlatencies in a distributed setting that offsets the advantages of per-token\nsparse activation. Our research explores task-specific model pruning to inform\ndecisions about designing SMoE architectures, mainly modulating the choice of\nexpert counts in pretraining. We investigate whether such pruned models offer\nadvantages over smaller SMoE models trained from scratch, when evaluating and\ncomparing them individually on tasks. To that end, we introduce an adaptive\ntask-aware pruning technique UNCURL to reduce the number of experts per MoE\nlayer in an offline manner post-training. Our findings reveal a threshold\npruning factor for the reduction that depends on the number of experts used in\npretraining, above which, the reduction starts to degrade model performance.\nThese insights contribute to our understanding of model design choices when\npretraining with SMoE architectures, particularly useful when considering\ntask-specific inference optimization for later stages.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-02T22:35:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-02T22:35:03Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. FlashDecoding++: Faster Large Language Model Inference on GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Ke Hong, Guohao Dai, Jiaming Xu, Qiuli Mao, Xiuhong Li, Jun Liu, Kangdi Chen, Yuhan Dong, Yu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** As the Large Language Model (LLM) becomes increasingly important in various\ndomains. However, the following challenges still remain unsolved in\naccelerating LLM inference: (1) Synchronized partial softmax update. The\nsoftmax operation requires a synchronized update operation among each partial\nsoftmax result, leading to ~20% overheads for the attention computation in\nLLMs. (2) Under-utilized computation of flat GEMM. The shape of matrices\nperforming GEMM in LLM inference is flat, leading to under-utilized computation\nand >50% performance loss after padding zeros in previous designs. (3)\nPerformance loss due to static dataflow. Kernel performance in LLM depends on\nvaried input data features, hardware configurations, etc. A single and static\ndataflow may lead to a 50.25% performance loss for GEMMs of different shapes in\nLLM inference.\n  We present FlashDecoding++, a fast LLM inference engine supporting mainstream\nLLMs and hardware back-ends. To tackle the above challenges, FlashDecoding++\ncreatively proposes: (1) Asynchronized softmax with unified max value.\nFlashDecoding++ introduces a unified max value technique for different partial\nsoftmax computations to avoid synchronization. (2) Flat GEMM optimization with\ndouble buffering. FlashDecoding++ points out that flat GEMMs with different\nshapes face varied bottlenecks. Then, techniques like double buffering are\nintroduced. (3) Heuristic dataflow with hardware resource adaptation.\nFlashDecoding++ heuristically optimizes dataflow using different hardware\nresource considering input dynamics. Due to the versatility of optimizations in\nFlashDecoding++, FlashDecoding++ can achieve up to 4.86x and 2.18x speedup on\nboth NVIDIA and AMD GPUs compared to Hugging Face implementations.\nFlashDecoding++ also achieves an average speedup of 1.37x compared to\nstate-of-the-art LLM inference engines on mainstream LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-02T14:57:03Z  (*Updated: 2024-01-05T12:41:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. S2-Attention: Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Xihui Lin, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge, Liliang Ren, Barun Patra, Vishrav Chaudhary, Hao Peng, Xia Song*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention, which selectively attends to a subset of tokens in the\ncontext was supposed to be efficient. However, its theoretical reduction in\nFLOPs has rarely translated into wall-clock speed-up over its dense attention\ncounterparts due to the lack of hardware-aware optimizations like\nFlashAttention. Meanwhile, it remains unclear whether sparse attention can\nmaintain the model's quality at a scale of today's large language models (LLMs)\nand how. This paper presents Sparsely-Sharded(S2) Attention, a Triton library\nthat provides kernel optimization for sparse attention customizable at both\nper-head and per-context-range levels. S2-Attention enables the exploration of\nnovel and high-performance sparse attention techniques, which we demonstrate\nthrough extensive ablations across a wide range of sparse attention designs at\nvarious model scales. From these insights, we present several basic guidelines\nto design sparse attention that can achieve not only practical efficiency\nimprovements, but also strong downstream performance. To achieve high\nparallelization and optimized memory IO, sparse attention should shard the\ncontext heterogeneously across attention heads, where each head attends to a\ndifferent subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context.\nMeanwhile, we find hybrid architectures combining sparse and dense attention\nparticularly beneficial in practice. S2-Attention achieves wall-clock speedup\nof 8.79X, 15.87X, 25.3X compared to the strong FlashAttention-2 baseline with\nstrong downstream performance on-par with full attention and perfect retrieval\nperformance at a 128k context length. At inference, for 7B models, our model,\nwith the help of our S2-Attention kernel, achieves 4.5x speed-up compared to\ndense counterparts. S2-Attention is released with easy-to-customize APIs for\ndirect usage in Megatron and vLLM.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-25T00:27:07Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-22T18:26:51Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. FastMoE: A Fast Mixture-of-Expert Training System\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical adaptive mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Jie Tang, Jidong Zhai, Zhilin Yang, Aohan Zeng, Jiezhong Qiu, Jiaao He*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) presents a strong potential in enlarging the size of language model to trillions of parameters. However, training trillion-scale MoE requires algorithm and system co-design for a well-tuned high performance distributed training system. Unfortunately, the only existing platform that meets the requirements strongly depends on Google's hardware (TPU) and software (Mesh Tensorflow) stack, and is not open and available to the public, especially GPU and PyTorch communities. In this paper, we present FastMoE, a distributed MoE training system based on PyTorch with common accelerators. The system provides a hierarchical interface for both flexible model design and easy adaption to different applications, such as Transformer-XL and Megatron-LM. Different from direct implementation of MoE models using PyTorch, the training speed is highly optimized in FastMoE by sophisticated high-performance acceleration skills. The system supports placing different experts on multiple GPUs across multiple nodes, enabling enlarging the number of experts linearly against the number of GPUs.

Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*Joshua Ainslie, James Lee-Thorp*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the speed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse Mixer encoder model. Sparse Mixer slightly outperforms (<1%) BERT on GLUE and SuperGLUE, but more importantly trains 65% faster and runs inference 61% faster. We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer, that marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly twice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating through various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters. Sparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models and offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to distilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 4. Light Field Neural Rendering\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training with dense inference in transformers\"*\n\n*Ameesh Makadia, Leonid Sigal, Carlos Esteves, Mohammed Suhail*\n\n**Abstract:** Classical light field rendering for novel view synthesis can accurately reproduce view-dependent effects such as reflection, refraction, and translucency, but requires a dense view sampling of the scene. Methods based on geometric reconstruction need only sparse views, but cannot accurately model non-Lambertian effects. We introduce a model that combines the strengths and mitigates the limitations of these two directions. By operating on a four-dimensional representation of the light field, our model learns to represent view-dependent effects accurately. By enforcing geometric constraints during training and inference, the scene geometry is implicitly learned from a sparse set of views. Concretely, we introduce a two-stage transformer-based model that first aggregates features along epipolar lines, then aggregates features along reference views to produce the color of a target ray. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple forward-facing and 360{\\deg} datasets, with larger margins on scenes with severe view-dependent variations.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. TorchSparse: Efficient Point Cloud Inference Engine\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention hardware optimization\"*\n\n*Song Han, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, focusing on adaptive sparse attention mechanisms, hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformers, sparse training with dense inference, and hardware optimization, here are the key insights and most useful information from the provided sources:\n\n## Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **SeerAttention** and **CASAK-V** are particularly relevant:\n  - **SeerAttention** learns intrinsic sparsity in attention maps using a learnable gate, allowing for dynamic adjustment of attention patterns. This approach maintains near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels and is adaptable to various context lengths and sparsity ratios.\n  - **CASAK-V** introduces a context-aware adaptive sparse attention mechanism that dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns. It also implements adaptive KV-cache compression, reducing memory usage by 40% and achieving near-linear runtime complexity.\n\n## Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformers with Adaptive Routing\n\n- While current literature on MoE models like **FastMoE** focuses on efficient training and scaling, there is a gap in exploring hierarchical expert integration combined with adaptive routing.\n- The proposal of hierarchical expert groups with adaptive routing in ASA appears novel and could offer improved parameter sharing and adaptability. However, it is crucial to verify this novelty through further searches on recent publications.\n\n## Sparse Training with Dense Inference\n\n- **Sparse MoE as the New Dropout** (SMoE-Dropout) by Chen et al. employs sparse MoE during training and transitions to dense transformers during inference, which aligns with ASA's concept. This method enables scaling transformers to better accuracy without compromising inference performance.\n- **Dynamic Sparse Training with Structured Sparsity** by Lasby et al. proposes a sparse-to-sparse dynamic sparse training method, which could be integrated with ASA's approach to enhance efficiency.\n\n## Hardware Optimization and Scalability\n\n- **Memory Efficiency and Hardware Constraints**:\n  - **CASAK-V** and **SeerAttention** both address memory efficiency. CASAK-V reduces memory usage by 40% and achieves near-linear runtime complexity, while SeerAttention's block-sparse pattern reduces computational overhead.\n  - **SqueezeLLM** by Kim et al. highlights that memory bandwidth is a significant bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs, emphasizing the need for memory-efficient designs.\n\n## Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n### Novelty and Feasibility\n\n- **Verify Hierarchical Adaptive Routing**: Conduct focused searches for recent publications (2024) on hierarchical MoE models with adaptive routing to confirm ASA's novelty.\n- **Practical Implementation**: Investigate how similar models handle training complexity and hardware constraints. Identify potential solutions to ensure ASA's feasibility in real-world applications.\n\n### Empirical Performance Data\n\n- **Benchmarks and Studies**: Seek out benchmarks and empirical studies on models employing adaptive sparse attention and hierarchical experts to estimate the potential impact of ASA on accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### Hardware Optimizations\n\n- **Align with Current Hardware**: Research hardware-aware optimizations for efficient training and inference. Ensure ASA's design leverages current hardware capabilities effectively.\n\n## Most Useful References\n\n- **SeerAttention**: For its innovative attention mechanism that learns and leverages intrinsic sparsity.\n- **CASAK-V**: For its dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression.\n- **Sparse MoE as the New Dropout**: For its approach to sparse training with dense inference.\n- **SqueezeLLM**: For its insights into memory efficiency and hardware constraints.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects and references, the researcher can comprehensively assess the novelty and feasibility of the proposed AdaptiveSparseAttention (ASA) mechanism and prepare for its implementation and evaluation.\n",

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

Dynamic Sparsity Is Channel-Level Sparsity Learner\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*Lu Yin, Gen Li, Meng Fang, Lijuan Shen, Tianjin Huang, Zhangyang Wang, V. Menkovski, Xiaolong Ma, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Shiwei Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase) is proposed, which for the first time seamlessly translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly channel-level sparsity during one end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse training has received an upsurging interest in machine learning due to its tantalizing saving potential for the entire training process as well as inference. Dynamic sparse training (DST), as a leading sparse training approach, can train deep neural networks at high sparsity from scratch to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most if not all DST prior arts demonstrate their effectiveness on unstructured sparsity with highly irregular sparse patterns, which receives limited support in common hardware. This limitation hinders the usage of DST in practice. In this paper, we propose Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase), which for the first time seamlessly translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly channel-level sparsity (not fine-grained N:M or group sparsity) during one end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations. The resulting small sparse networks can be directly accelerated by commodity hardware, without using any particularly sparsity-aware hardware accelerators. This appealing outcome is partially motivated by a hidden phenomenon of dynamic sparsity: off-the-shelf unstructured DST implicitly involves biased parameter reallocation across channels, with a large fraction of channels (up to 60%) being sparser than others. By progressively identifying and removing these channels during training, our approach translates unstructured sparsity to channel-wise sparsity. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chase achieves 1.7 X inference throughput speedup on common GPU devices without compromising accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

Dynamic Grained Encoder for Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*Lin Song, Songyang Zhang, Songtao Liu, Zeming Li, Xuming He, Hongbin Sun, Jian Sun, Nanning Zheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Dynamic Grained Encoder for vision transformers is proposed, which can adaptively assign a suitable number of queries to each spatial region and achieves a fine-grained representation in discriminative regions while keeping high efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers, the de-facto standard for language modeling, have been recently applied for vision tasks. This paper introduces sparse queries for vision transformers to exploit the intrinsic spatial redundancy of natural images and save computational costs. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Grained Encoder for vision transformers, which can adaptively assign a suitable number of queries to each spatial region. Thus it achieves a fine-grained representation in discriminative regions while keeping high efficiency. Besides, the dynamic grained encoder is compatible with most vision transformer frameworks. Without bells and whistles, our encoder allows the state-of-the-art vision transformers to reduce computational complexity by 40%-60% while maintaining comparable performance on image classification. Extensive experiments on object detection and segmentation further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach.

SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper, A. Gholami, Zhen Dong, Xiuyu Li, Sheng Shen, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint, demonstrates that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7.

Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse DST method, Structured RigL (SRigL), to learn a variant of fine-grained structured N:M sparsity by imposing a constant fan-in constraint. Using our empirical analysis of existing DST methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables SRigL to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured DST performance on a variety of Neural Network (NN) architectures. Using a 90% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4x/2.5x on CPU for online inference and 1.7x/13.0x on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive\n  Connection\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Mingxin Zhou, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of\ntasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the\ninput length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper,\nwe present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse\nAdaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and\nattention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with\nprevious self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model\nlearns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In\nthis way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the\nquadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show\nthat previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through\nextensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph\nrepresentation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is\ncompetitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory\ncost.\n\n**Published:** 2020-03-22T07:58:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-09-29T08:01:23Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive\n  Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aurelien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard\nto scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their\ncomputational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs\nof tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we\npresent a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while\npreserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and\ncomputational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable\nmechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the\ncontext at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach\nnot only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability,\nproviding valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our\ntechnique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a\nstraightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified\nby a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we\ncan effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance\ndegradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating\ninference costs.

Global Contrastive Training for Multimodal Electronic Health Records\n  with Language Supervision\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*Yingbo Ma, Suraj Kolla, Zhenhong Hu, Dhruv Kaliraman, Victoria Nolan, Ziyuan Guan, Yuanfang Ren, Brooke Armfield, Tezcan Ozrazgat-Baslanti, Jeremy A. Balch, Tyler J. Loftus, Parisa Rashidi, Azra Bihorac, Benjamin Shickel*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern electronic health records (EHRs) hold immense promise in tracking\npersonalized patient health trajectories through sequential deep learning,\nowing to their extensive breadth, scale, and temporal granularity. Nonetheless,\nhow to effectively leverage multiple modalities from EHRs poses significant\nchallenges, given its complex characteristics such as high dimensionality,\nmultimodality, sparsity, varied recording frequencies, and temporal\nirregularities. To this end, this paper introduces a novel multimodal\ncontrastive learning framework, specifically focusing on medical time series\nand clinical notes. To tackle the challenge of sparsity and irregular time\nintervals in medical time series, the framework integrates temporal\ncross-attention transformers with a dynamic embedding and tokenization scheme\nfor learning multimodal feature representations. To harness the interconnected\nrelationships between medical time series and clinical notes, the framework\nequips a global contrastive loss, aligning a patient's multimodal feature\nrepresentations with the corresponding discharge summaries. Since discharge\nsummaries uniquely pertain to individual patients and represent a holistic view\nof the patient's hospital stay, machine learning models are led to learn\ndiscriminative multimodal features via global contrasting. Extensive\nexperiments with a real-world EHR dataset demonstrated that our framework\noutperformed state-of-the-art approaches on the exemplar task of predicting the\noccurrence of nine postoperative complications for more than 120,000 major\ninpatient surgeries using multimodal data from UF health system split among\nthree hospitals (UF Health Gainesville, UF Health Jacksonville, and UF Health\nJacksonville-North).\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-10T04:19:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-10T04:19:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*James Lee-Thorp, Joshua Ainslie*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the\nspeed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse\nMixer encoder model.

We also present a faster variant, prosaically named Fast Sparse Mixer,\nthat marginally underperforms BERT on SuperGLUE, but trains and runs nearly\ntwice as fast. We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating\nthrough various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters.\nSparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models\nand offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to\ndistilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24T23:08:54Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T17:47:14Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$: Towards Building Reliable Language Models with\n  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity as a promising\nframework for scaling up large language models (LLMs). However, the reliability\nassessment of MoE lags behind its surging applications. Moreover, when\ntransferred to new domains such as in fine-tuning MoE models sometimes\nunderperform their dense counterparts. Motivated by the research gap and\ncounter-intuitive phenomenon, we propose $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$, the first\ncomprehensive assessment of SMoE reliability from three aspects: $\\textit{(i)}$\nsafety and hallucination, $\\textit{(ii)}$ resilience to adversarial attacks,\nand $\\textit{(iii)}$ out-of-distribution robustness. Extensive models and\ndatasets are tested to compare the MoE to dense networks from these reliability\ndimensions. Our empirical observations suggest that with appropriate\nhyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, we can build the\nMoE model more reliably than the dense LLM. In particular, we find that the\nrobustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings. We hope that\nthis study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the pre-trained MoE\nmodel to other tasks with higher-generation security, quality, and stability.\nCodes are available at https://github.com/UNITES-Lab/MoE-RBench\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-17T09:17:05Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-17T09:17:05Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/joshyZhou/AST.    \n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention\"*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. DSVT: Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer with Rotated Sets\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*LiWei Wang, Bernt Schiele, Di He, Sen Wang, Meng Lei, Shaoshuai Shi, Chen Shi, Haiyang Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Designing an efficient yet deployment-friendly 3D backbone to handle sparse point clouds is a fundamental problem in 3D perception. Compared with the customized sparse convolution, the attention mechanism in Transformers is more appropriate for flexibly modeling long-range relationships and is easier to be deployed in real-world applications. However, due to the sparse characteristics of point clouds, it is non-trivial to apply a standard transformer on sparse points. In this paper, we present Dynamic Sparse Voxel Transformer (DSVT), a single-stride window-based voxel Transformer backbone for outdoor 3D perception. In order to efficiently process sparse points in parallel, we propose Dynamic Sparse Window Attention, which partitions a series of local regions in each window according to its sparsity and then computes the features of all regions in a fully parallel manner. To allow the cross-set connection, we design a rotated set partitioning strategy that alternates between two partitioning configurations in consecutive self-attention layers. To support effective downsampling and better encode geometric information, we also propose an attention-style 3D pooling module on sparse points, which is powerful and deployment-friendly without utilizing any customized CUDA operations. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance with a broad range of 3D perception tasks. More importantly, DSVT can be easily deployed by TensorRT with real-time inference speed (27Hz).

Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic sparsity transformers\"*\n\n*Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan, Yuan-Fang Li, Yuxuan Liang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaoming Shi, James Y. Zhang, Zhixuan Chu, Lintao Ma, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts.

DeepSpeed-MoE: Advancing Mixture-of-Experts Inference and Training to Power Next-Generation AI Scale\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Jeff Rasley, Ammar Ahmad Awan, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Minjia Zhang, Zhewei Yao, Conglong Li, Samyam Rajbhandari*\n\n**Abstract:** As the training of giant dense models hits the boundary on the availability and capability of the hardware resources today, Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models become one of the most promising model architectures due to their significant training cost reduction compared to a quality-equivalent dense model. Its training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works) to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly optimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared to existing MoE inference solutions. DeepSpeed-MoE offers an unprecedented scale and efficiency to serve massive MoE models with up to 4.5x faster and 9x cheaper inference compared to quality-equivalent dense models. We hope our innovations and systems help open a promising path to new directions in the large model landscape, a shift from dense to sparse MoE models, where training and deploying higher-quality models with fewer resources becomes more widely possible.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and evaluating the AdaptiveSparseAttention (ASA) mechanism, here are the key points and relevant information that can be leveraged:\n\n## Novelty of Sparse Training with Dense Inference\n\n- The concept of training models with sparse computations and deploying them with dense computations is relatively unexplored. Existing models like the **Switch Transformer** by Fedus et al. (2022) use sparse activations during both training and inference, but ASA's approach of maintaining dense capabilities during inference is novel.\n\n## Adaptive Routing Mechanisms\n\n- **Routing Transformers** by Roy et al. (2021) employ dynamic sparse attention by routing each token to a subset of expert attention heads. This is similar to ASA's adaptive routing mechanism. However, ASA's specific implementation and its combination with sparse training and dense inference need to be compared and contrasted with existing methods.\n\n## Hierarchical Expert Models\n\n- Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, such as the **Switch Transformer**, use expert layers with a gating mechanism to improve parameter efficiency. ASA's hierarchical expert groups may offer a new way to organize experts, potentially improving parameter sharing and adaptation to input characteristics. Investigating how ASA's hierarchical structure differs from and improves upon existing MoE models is crucial.\n\n## Scale-Aware Position Representations\n\n- Adaptive position encoding methods, such as those proposed by Ke et al. (2021), handle varying sequence lengths effectively. ASA's scale-aware position representation might build upon these ideas, integrating them with sparse attention patterns. Reviewing these existing methods will help in understanding how ASA can improve upon them.\n\n## Impact on Model Performance\n\n- Sparse attention mechanisms generally aim to reduce computational complexity while maintaining or improving model performance. The combination of techniques in ASA needs to be evaluated for its effect on accuracy, robustness, efficiency, and scalability. Comparing ASA with models like **Sparse Transformers** by Child et al. (2019) and **Efficient Transformers** surveyed by Tay et al. (2020) will provide insights into its performance.\n\n## Useful References and Insights\n\n- **Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers** by Roy et al.

LongHeads: Multi-Head Attention is Secretly a Long Context Processor (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Yi Lu, Xin Zhou, Wei He, Jun Zhao, Tao Ji, Tao Gui, Qi Zhang, Xuanjing Huang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongHeads is a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential, and achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in numerous domains but often struggle to process lengthy inputs effectively and efficiently due to limited length generalization and attention's quadratic computational demands. Many sought to mitigate this by restricting the attention window within the pre-trained length. However, these methods introduce new issues such as ignoring the middle context and requiring additional training. To address these problems, we propose LongHeads, a training-free framework that enhances LLM's long context ability by unlocking multi-head attention's untapped potential. Instead of allowing each head to attend to the full sentence, which struggles with generalizing to longer sequences due to out-of-distribution (OOD) issues, we allow each head to process in-distribution length by selecting and attending to important context chunks. To this end, we propose a chunk selection strategy that relies on the inherent correlation between the query and the key representations, efficiently distributing context chunks to different heads. In this way, each head ensures it can effectively process attended tokens within the trained length, while different heads in different layers can collectively process longer contexts. LongHeads works efficiently in linear time, fits seamlessly with many LLMs that use relative positional encoding. LongHeads achieves 100% accuracy at the 128k length on passkey retrieval task, verifying LongHeads's efficacy in extending the usable context window for existing models.

However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/45 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLillicrap. 2020.

In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference transformers\"*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. From Sparse to Soft Mixtures of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference transformers\"*\n\n*J. Puigcerver, C. Riquelme, Basil Mustafa, N. Houlsby*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses challenges of training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse mixture of expert architectures (MoEs) scale model capacity without significant increases in training or inference costs. Despite their success, MoEs suffer from a number of issues: training instability, token dropping, inability to scale the number of experts, or ineffective finetuning. In this work, we propose Soft MoE, a fully-differentiable sparse Transformer that addresses these challenges, while maintaining the benefits of MoEs. Soft MoE performs an implicit soft assignment by passing different weighted combinations of all input tokens to each expert. As in other MoEs, experts in Soft MoE only process a subset of the (combined) tokens, enabling larger model capacity (and performance) at lower inference cost. In the context of visual recognition, Soft MoE greatly outperforms dense Transformers (ViTs) and popular MoEs (Tokens Choice and Experts Choice). Furthermore, Soft MoE scales well: Soft MoE Huge/14 with 128 experts in 16 MoE layers has over 40x more parameters than ViT Huge/14, with only 2% increased inference time, and substantially better quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 3. SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference transformers\"*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper, A. Gholami, Zhen Dong, Xiuyu Li, Sheng Shen, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint, demonstrates that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Goan, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The BiSHop framework, a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning, is introduced, demonstrating that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the \\textbf{B}i-Directional \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{Hop}field Network (\\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

Sparse Mixers: Combining MoE and Mixing to build a more efficient BERT\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference transformers\"*\n\n*James Lee-Thorp, Joshua Ainslie*\n\n**Abstract:** We combine the capacity of sparsely gated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) with the\nspeed and stability of linear, mixing transformations to design the Sparse\nMixer encoder model.

We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating\nthrough various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters.\nSparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models\nand offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to\ndistilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24T23:08:54Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T17:47:14Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

S. Lakshmanan, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah, Sebastien Bubeck, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) models have obtained state-of-the-art performance in\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT) tasks. Existing works in MoE mostly consider a\nhomogeneous design where the same number of experts of the same size are placed\nuniformly throughout the network. Furthermore, existing MoE works do not\nconsider computational constraints (e.g., FLOPs, latency) to guide their\ndesign. To this end, we develop AutoMoE -- a framework for designing\nheterogeneous MoE's under computational constraints. AutoMoE leverages Neural\nArchitecture Search (NAS) to obtain efficient sparse MoE sub-transformers with\n4x inference speedup (CPU) and FLOPs reduction over manually designed\nTransformers, with parity in BLEU score over dense Transformer and within 1\nBLEU point of MoE SwitchTransformer, on aggregate over benchmark datasets for\nNMT. Heterogeneous search space with dense and sparsely activated Transformer\nmodules (e.g., how many experts? where to place them? what should be their\nsizes?) allows for adaptive compute -- where different amounts of computations\nare used for different tokens in the input. Adaptivity comes naturally from\nrouting decisions which send tokens to experts of different sizes.

Learning Syntax Without Planting Trees: Understanding When and Why\n  Transformers Generalize Hierarchically\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Kabir Ahuja, Vidhisha Balachandran, Madhur Panwar, Tianxing He, Noah A. Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its\nhierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic\nstructures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we\ninvestigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training\nthat could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively\nexperiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and\nwith different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead\nto hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling\nobjective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct\npruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language\nmodeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint\nexistence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization\nbehaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear\norder). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover\ntransformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a\ncorrelation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset\nand whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a\nhierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear\ngeneralization.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-25T07:10:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-31T23:47:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, Henryk Michalewski*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling\ntasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to\nproduce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or\nwell-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are\nimpressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their\napplications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit\nhierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle\nlong sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to\ndownsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them\nhierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to\ncreate Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass\nimproves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and\ncan yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently.

In this paper,\nwe present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse\nAdaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and\nattention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with\nprevious self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model\nlearns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In\nthis way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the\nquadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show\nthat previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases.

Methods based on geometric reconstruction need only sparse views, but cannot accurately model non-Lambertian effects. We introduce a model that combines the strengths and mitigates the limitations of these two directions. By operating on a four-dimensional representation of the light field, our model learns to represent view-dependent effects accurately. By enforcing geometric constraints during training and inference, the scene geometry is implicitly learned from a sparse set of views. Concretely, we introduce a two-stage transformer-based model that first aggregates features along epipolar lines, then aggregates features along reference views to produce the color of a target ray. Our model outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple forward-facing and 360{\\deg} datasets, with larger margins on scenes with severe view-dependent variations.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 3. FastMoE: A Fast Mixture-of-Expert Training System\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Jie Tang, Jidong Zhai, Zhilin Yang, Aohan Zeng, Jiezhong Qiu, Jiaao He*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Expert (MoE) presents a strong potential in enlarging the size of language model to trillions of parameters. However, training trillion-scale MoE requires algorithm and system co-design for a well-tuned high performance distributed training system. Unfortunately, the only existing platform that meets the requirements strongly depends on Google's hardware (TPU) and software (Mesh Tensorflow) stack, and is not open and available to the public, especially GPU and PyTorch communities. In this paper, we present FastMoE, a distributed MoE training system based on PyTorch with common accelerators. The system provides a hierarchical interface for both flexible model design and easy adaption to different applications, such as Transformer-XL and Megatron-LM. Different from direct implementation of MoE models using PyTorch, the training speed is highly optimized in FastMoE by sophisticated high-performance acceleration skills. The system supports placing different experts on multiple GPUs across multiple nodes, enabling enlarging the number of experts linearly against the number of GPUs.

Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems,\nwhich seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of\nactions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches\nhave proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nMarkov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of\njust their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for\nlonger-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods\nperform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,\nwhile RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is\naffordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a\nself-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture\nlong-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its\npredictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,\nSASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action\nhistory, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies\nshow that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models\n(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.\nMoreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable\nCNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our\nmodel adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful\npatterns in activity sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Adaptively Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Gon\u00e7alo M. Correia, Vlad Niculae*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\n**Conference:** adaptively-sparse-transformers-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are the key insights and most useful information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Adaptive Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The researcher is particularly interested in adaptive sparse attention mechanisms. Works like **CASAK-V** and **SeerAttention** are highly relevant. These mechanisms dynamically adjust attention patterns based on the input, which is crucial for capturing long-range dependencies and improving efficiency.\n  - **CASAK-V** uses a dynamic sparse attention mechanism and adaptive KV-cache compression, which allows for efficient long-context processing with minimal performance degradation and reduced memory usage.\n  - **SeerAttention** introduces a learnable gate to adaptively select significant blocks in the attention map, effectively reducing computational and memory costs while maintaining accuracy.\n\n## Dynamic Sparsity and Efficiency\n\n- Dynamic sparsity is a key theme in recent research. **SeerAttention** and **CASAK-V** both emphasize learning sparsity patterns rather than relying on predefined ones, which enhances adaptability and efficiency.\n- These mechanisms are designed to balance accuracy and speedup, making them suitable for long-context LLMs and resource-constrained environments.\n\n## Hierarchical Expert Models\n\n- The researcher is interested in hierarchical mixture-of-experts (MoE) models. While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss hierarchical MoE in the context of transformers, works like **Routing Transformers**[Analysis Note, Internal Sources] and **Sparse MoE as the New Dropout**[Analysis Note, External Sources] provide insights into using MoE for sparse and efficient modeling.\n  - **Routing Transformers** employ dynamic sparse attention by routing each token to a subset of expert attention heads, which could be a precursor to more complex hierarchical models.\n\n## Scale-Aware Position Representations\n\n- The concept of scale-aware position representations is important for handling varying sequence lengths efficiently. While the sources do not delve deeply into this specific aspect, **CASAK-V** and other adaptive attention mechanisms imply the need for dynamic adjustments based on input context, which could be integrated with scale-aware position encodings.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Hardware Efficiency\n\n- Practical implementation and hardware considerations are crucial. Works like **Dynamic Sparse Training with Structured Sparsity**[Analysis Note, External Sources] and **Channel-aware dynamic sparse**[Analysis Note, External Sources] highlight the importance of translating sparsity patterns into hardware-efficient computations.\n  - Ensuring that the proposed sparse training methods are compatible with and can be accelerated by commodity hardware is essential for real-world deployment.\n\n## Key Insights for ASA\n\n- **Novelty of Sparse Training with Dense Inference**: The combination of sparse training with dense inference is not widely explored. ASA's approach, if successfully implemented, could offer a novel contribution by balancing training efficiency with inference performance[Analysis Note].\n- **Adaptive Routing Mechanisms**: ASA's adaptive routing mechanism, combined with hierarchical expert groups and scale-aware position encodings, could provide a unique and efficient approach to sparse attention[Analysis Note].\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- To further verify the novelty and feasibility of ASA, focus on recent works (2023-2024) that explore:\n  - **Sparse training with dense inference in transformers**: Look for any recent studies that specifically address this combination.\n  - **Hierarchical mixture-of-experts in transformers**: Investigate recent research on hierarchical MoE models to compare with ASA's approach.\n  - **Practical implementations and hardware considerations**: Search for papers discussing the practical implementation of adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts, focusing on hardware constraints and real-world deployments.\n  - **Scalability and performance benchmarks**: Find empirical studies and benchmarks comparing models employing adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts to establish performance expectations for ASA.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researcher can gather comprehensive information to assess the novelty, feasibility, and potential impact of the proposed AdaptiveSparseAttention (ASA) mechanism.\n",

Most models employing dynamic sparsity use sparse mechanisms during both training and inference.\n  - **Chen et al. (2023)** propose SMoE-Dropout, which focuses on scaling dense transformers by employing sparse MoE during training but they still use dense inference. This is somewhat similar to ASA's approach, but ASA's specific mechanism and focus may differ.\n  - **Yin et al. (2023)** address the translation of dynamic sparsity to channel-wise sparsity, enabling speedups on standard hardware. This indicates interest in making sparsity practical for deployment, which aligns with ASA's goals.\n\n- **Adaptive Routing Mechanisms**:\n\n  - **Routing Transformers** and **Sparse MoE models** use routing mechanisms to dynamically select sparse subsets of the network during training and inference.\n  - ASA's adaptive routing mechanism might differ in that it combines sparse training with dense inference through dynamic sparsity patterns learned during training and applies dense computation during inference.\n  - **Zhang et al. (2023)** introduce an adaptive attention mechanism in sparse-based transformers for long sequences, which seems related to ASA's adaptive sparsity mechanism.\n\n- **Hierarchical Expert Integration**:\n\n  - The use of hierarchical expert groups in ASA is potentially novel. While MoE models use experts and gating mechanisms, the hierarchical organization of experts and the efficient parameter sharing in ASA might offer new contributions.\n  - **Chen et al. (2023)** explore scaling dense transformers with SMoE-Dropout, treating sparse MoE as a form of regularization (similar to dropout), which is an interesting perspective but different from hierarchical expert integration.\n\n- **Scale-Aware Position Representations**:\n\n  - ASA proposes a ScaleAwarePositionEncoder to handle varying sequence lengths efficiently. Existing methods, such as Rotary Positional Embeddings and methods from **Ke et al. (2021)**, also address position encoding for different lengths.\n  - The novelty may lie in how ASA integrates scale-awareness with adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts.\n\n- **Impact on Model Performance**:\n\n  - The combination of sparse training with dense inference could lead to training efficiency gains while maintaining inference performance.\n  - Potential challenges include ensuring that the learned sparsity patterns during training translate effectively to dense inference computations.\n  - Implementing hierarchical experts and adaptive routing may introduce complexity but could improve parameter utilization and model adaptability.\n\n- **Practical Considerations**:\n\n  - **Lasby et al. (2023)** and **Yin et al. (2023)** highlight the importance of hardware considerations when working with sparse models. Translation of sparsity patterns to hardware-efficient computations is crucial.\n  - The efficacy of sparse training methods depends on the underlying hardware's ability to handle sparse computations. ASA needs to ensure that the proposed methods are practical and lead to actual efficiency gains.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan**\n\n- **Verify Novelty of Sparse Training with Dense Inference**:\n\n  - Focus on finding any recent works (2023-2024) that specifically explore sparse training with dense inference in transformers.\n  - Keywords: \"sparse training dense inference transformers\", \"sparse-to-dense transformers\", \"dynamic sparsity dense inference\".\n\n- **Deep Dive into Hierarchical Expert Models**:\n\n  - Look for recent research on hierarchical mixture-of-experts in transformers to compare with ASA's hierarchical expert groups.\n  - Keywords: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\", \"hierarchical experts in attention mechanisms\", \"multi-level experts transformers\".\n\n- **Assess Practical Implementations and Challenges**:\n\n  - Search for papers discussing the practical implementation of adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts, especially focusing on hardware considerations and real-world deployments.\n  - Keywords: \"sparse transformers hardware acceleration\", \"efficient sparse attention implementation\", \"dynamic sparsity in transformers\".\n\n- **Examine Scalability and Performance Benchmarks**:\n\n  - Find empirical studies and benchmarks comparing models employing adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts to establish performance expectations for ASA.\n\n5. **References**\n\n- [1] Roy, A., Saffar, M., Vaswani, A., & Grangier, D.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAssociation for Computing Machinery.

Score: 0.97)\n\n*Hao Peng, Jungo Kasai, Nikolaos Pappas, Dani Yogatama, Zhaofeng Wu, Lingpeng Kong, Roy Schwartz, Noah A. Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/39 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

SqueezeLLM: Dense-and-Sparse Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper, A. Gholami, Zhen Dong, Xiuyu Li, Sheng Shen, Michael W. Mahoney, K. Keutzer*\n\n**TL;DR:** SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint, demonstrates that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable results for a wide range of tasks. However, deploying these models for inference has been a significant challenge due to their unprecedented resource requirements. This has forced existing deployment frameworks to use multi-GPU inference pipelines, which are often complex and costly, or to use smaller and less performant models. In this work, we demonstrate that the main bottleneck for generative inference with LLMs is memory bandwidth, rather than compute, specifically for single batch inference. While quantization has emerged as a promising solution by representing weights with reduced precision, previous efforts have often resulted in notable performance degradation. To address this, we introduce SqueezeLLM, a post-training quantization framework that not only enables lossless compression to ultra-low precisions of up to 3-bit, but also achieves higher quantization performance under the same memory constraint. Our framework incorporates two novel ideas: (i) sensitivity-based non-uniform quantization, which searches for the optimal bit precision assignment based on second-order information; and (ii) the Dense-and-Sparse decomposition that stores outliers and sensitive weight values in an efficient sparse format. When applied to the LLaMA models, our 3-bit quantization significantly reduces the perplexity gap from the FP16 baseline by up to 2.1x as compared to the state-of-the-art methods with the same memory requirement. Furthermore, when deployed on an A6000 GPU, our quantized models achieve up to 2.3x speedup compared to the baseline.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Although the resulting models are highly sparse and theoretically less computationally expensive, achieving speedups with unstructured sparsity on real-world hardware is challenging. In this work, we propose a sparse-to-sparse DST method, Structured RigL (SRigL), to learn a variant of fine-grained structured N:M sparsity by imposing a constant fan-in constraint. Using our empirical analysis of existing DST methods at high sparsity, we additionally employ a neuron ablation method which enables SRigL to achieve state-of-the-art sparse-to-sparse structured DST performance on a variety of Neural Network (NN) architectures. Using a 90% sparse linear layer, we demonstrate a real-world acceleration of 3.4x/2.5x on CPU for online inference and 1.7x/13.0x on GPU for inference with a batch size of 256 when compared to equivalent dense/unstructured (CSR) sparse layers, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Efficient Sparse Attention needs Adaptive Token Release\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*Chaoran Zhang, Lixin Zou, Dan Luo, Min Tang, Xiangyang Luo, Zihao Li, Chenliang Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that the adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states of the transformer achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across a wide array of text-centric tasks. However, their `large' scale introduces significant computational and storage challenges, particularly in managing the key-value states of the transformer, which limits their wider applicability. Therefore, we propose to adaptively release resources from caches and rebuild the necessary key-value states. Particularly, we accomplish this by a lightweight controller module to approximate an ideal top-$K$ sparse attention. This module retains the tokens with the highest top-$K$ attention weights and simultaneously rebuilds the discarded but necessary tokens, which may become essential for future decoding. Comprehensive experiments in natural language generation and modeling reveal that our method is not only competitive with full attention in terms of performance but also achieves a significant throughput improvement of up to 221.8%.

SAC: Accelerating and Structuring Self-Attention via Sparse Adaptive Connection\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*Xiaoya Li, Yuxian Meng, Qinghong Han, Fei Wu, Jiwei Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, it is demonstrated SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Abstract:** While the self-attention mechanism has been widely used in a wide variety of tasks, it has the unfortunate property of a quadratic cost with respect to the input length, which makes it difficult to deal with long inputs. In this paper, we present a method for accelerating and structuring self-attentions: Sparse Adaptive Connection (SAC). In SAC, we regard the input sequence as a graph and attention operations are performed between linked nodes. In contrast with previous self-attention models with pre-defined structures (edges), the model learns to construct attention edges to improve task-specific performances. In this way, the model is able to select the most salient nodes and reduce the quadratic complexity regardless of the sequence length. Based on SAC, we show that previous variants of self-attention models are its special cases. Through extensive experiments on neural machine translation, language modeling, graph representation learning and image classification, we demonstrate SAC is competitive with state-of-the-art models while significantly reducing memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Learning Syntax Without Planting Trees: Understanding When and Why\n  Transformers Generalize Hierarchically\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Kabir Ahuja, Vidhisha Balachandran, Madhur Panwar, Tianxing He, Noah A. Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its\nhierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic\nstructures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we\ninvestigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training\nthat could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively\nexperiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and\nwith different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead\nto hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling\nobjective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct\npruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language\nmodeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint\nexistence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization\nbehaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear\norder). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover\ntransformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a\ncorrelation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset\nand whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a\nhierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear\ngeneralization.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-25T07:10:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-31T23:47:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, Henryk Michalewski*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling\ntasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to\nproduce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or\nwell-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are\nimpressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their\napplications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit\nhierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle\nlong sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to\ndownsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them\nhierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to\ncreate Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model.

We justify the design of these two models by carefully ablating\nthrough various mixing mechanisms, MoE configurations and hyperparameters.\nSparse Mixer overcomes many of the latency and stability concerns of MoE models\nand offers the prospect of serving sparse student models, without resorting to\ndistilling them to dense variants.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-24T23:08:54Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-13T17:47:14Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$: Towards Building Reliable Language Models with\n  Sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"sparse training dense inference\"*\n\n*Guanjie Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Tianlong Chen, Yu Cheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity as a promising\nframework for scaling up large language models (LLMs). However, the reliability\nassessment of MoE lags behind its surging applications. Moreover, when\ntransferred to new domains such as in fine-tuning MoE models sometimes\nunderperform their dense counterparts. Motivated by the research gap and\ncounter-intuitive phenomenon, we propose $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$, the first\ncomprehensive assessment of SMoE reliability from three aspects: $\\textit{(i)}$\nsafety and hallucination, $\\textit{(ii)}$ resilience to adversarial attacks,\nand $\\textit{(iii)}$ out-of-distribution robustness.

Our empirical observations suggest that with appropriate\nhyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, we can build the\nMoE model more reliably than the dense LLM. In particular, we find that the\nrobustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings.

SeerAttention: Learning Intrinsic Sparse Attention in Your LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*Yizhao Gao, Zhichen Zeng, Dayou Du, Shijie Cao, Hayden Kwok-Hay So, Ting Cao, Fan Yang, Mao Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is the cornerstone of modern Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet its\nquadratic complexity limits the efficiency and scalability of LLMs, especially\nfor those with a long-context window. A promising approach addressing this\nlimitation is to leverage the sparsity in attention. However, existing\nsparsity-based solutions predominantly rely on predefined patterns or\nheuristics to approximate sparsity. This practice falls short to fully capture\nthe dynamic nature of attention sparsity in language-based tasks. This paper\nargues that attention sparsity should be learned rather than predefined. To\nthis end, we design SeerAttention, a new Attention mechanism that augments the\nconventional attention with a learnable gate that adaptively selects\nsignificant blocks in an attention map and deems the rest blocks sparse. Such\nblock-level sparsity effectively balances accuracy and speedup. To enable\nefficient learning of the gating network, we develop a customized\nFlashAttention implementation that extracts the block-level ground truth of\nattention map with minimum overhead. SeerAttention not only applies to\npost-training, but also excels in long-context fine-tuning. Our results show\nthat at post-training stages, SeerAttention significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art static or heuristic-based sparse attention methods, while also\nbeing more versatile and flexible to adapt to varying context lengths and\nsparsity ratios. When applied to long-context fine-tuning with YaRN,\nSeerAttention can achieve a remarkable 90% sparsity ratio at a 32k context\nlength with minimal perplexity loss, offering a 5.67x speedup over\nFlashAttention-2.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-17T07:07:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-18T05:01:11Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. Sparse Autoencoders Enable Scalable and Reliable Circuit Identification\n  in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*Charles O'Neill, Thang Bui*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces an efficient and robust method for discovering\ninterpretable circuits in large language models using discrete sparse\nautoencoders. Our approach addresses key limitations of existing techniques,\nnamely computational complexity and sensitivity to hyperparameters. We propose\ntraining sparse autoencoders on carefully designed positive and negative\nexamples, where the model can only correctly predict the next token for the\npositive examples. We hypothesise that learned representations of attention\nhead outputs will signal when a head is engaged in specific computations. By\ndiscretising the learned representations into integer codes and measuring the\noverlap between codes unique to positive examples for each head, we enable\ndirect identification of attention heads involved in circuits without the need\nfor expensive ablations or architectural modifications. On three well-studied\ntasks - indirect object identification, greater-than comparisons, and docstring\ncompletion - the proposed method achieves higher precision and recall in\nrecovering ground-truth circuits compared to state-of-the-art baselines, while\nreducing runtime from hours to seconds. Notably, we require only 5-10 text\nexamples for each task to learn robust representations. Our findings highlight\nthe promise of discrete sparse autoencoders for scalable and efficient\nmechanistic interpretability, offering a new direction for analysing the inner\nworkings of large language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-21T06:26:10Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-21T06:26:10Z*)\n\n\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical mixture-of-experts transformers\"*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, training trillion-scale MoE requires algorithm and system co-design for a well-tuned high performance distributed training system. Unfortunately, the only existing platform that meets the requirements strongly depends on Google's hardware (TPU) and software (Mesh Tensorflow) stack, and is not open and available to the public, especially GPU and PyTorch communities. In this paper, we present FastMoE, a distributed MoE training system based on PyTorch with common accelerators. The system provides a hierarchical interface for both flexible model design and easy adaption to different applications, such as Transformer-XL and Megatron-LM. Different from direct implementation of MoE models using PyTorch, the training speed is highly optimized in FastMoE by sophisticated high-performance acceleration skills. The system supports placing different experts on multiple GPUs across multiple nodes, enabling enlarging the number of experts linearly against the number of GPUs.

Its training cost saving is demonstrated from encoder-decoder models (prior works) to a 5x saving for auto-aggressive language models (this work along with parallel explorations). However, due to the much larger model size and unique architecture, how to provide fast MoE model inference remains challenging and unsolved, limiting its practical usage. To tackle this, we present DeepSpeed-MoE, an end-to-end MoE training and inference solution as part of the DeepSpeed library, including novel MoE architecture designs and model compression techniques that reduce MoE model size by up to 3.7x, and a highly optimized inference system that provides 7.3x better latency and cost compared to existing MoE inference solutions. DeepSpeed-MoE offers an unprecedented scale and efficiency to serve massive MoE models with up to 4.5x faster and 9x cheaper inference compared to quality-equivalent dense models. We hope our innovations and systems help open a promising path to new directions in the large model landscape, a shift from dense to sparse MoE models, where training and deploying higher-quality models with fewer resources becomes more widely possible.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. Bayesian Sparse Tucker Models for Dimension Reduction and Tensor Completion\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*Andrzej Cichocki, Qibin Zhao, Liqing Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Tucker decomposition is the cornerstone of modern machine learning on\ntensorial data analysis, which have attracted considerable attention for\nmultiway feature extraction, compressive sensing, and tensor completion. The\nmost challenging problem is related to determination of model complexity (i.e.,\nmultilinear rank), especially when noise and missing data are present. In\naddition, existing methods cannot take into account uncertainty information of\nlatent factors, resulting in low generalization performance. To address these\nissues, we present a class of probabilistic generative Tucker models for tensor\ndecomposition and completion with structural sparsity over multilinear latent\nspace. To exploit structural sparse modeling, we introduce two group sparsity\ninducing priors by hierarchial representation of Laplace and Student-t\ndistributions, which facilitates fully posterior inference. For model learning,\nwe derived variational Bayesian inferences over all model (hyper)parameters,\nand developed efficient and scalable algorithms based on multilinear\noperations. Our methods can automatically adapt model complexity and infer an\noptimal multilinear rank by the principle of maximum lower bound of model\nevidence. Experimental results and comparisons on synthetic, chemometrics and\nneuroimaging data demonstrate remarkable performance of our models for\nrecovering ground-truth of multilinear rank and missing entries.\n\n**Published:** 2015-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Tackling fluffy clouds: field boundaries detection using time series of S2 and/or S1 imagery\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive sparse attention scalability\"*\n\n*John Taylor, Andrew Toovey, Chris Herrmann, Kathryn Batchelor, Jonathan Richetti, Ondrej Hlinka, Rodrigo Ibata, Peter Caccetta, Amy Parker, Roger Lawes, Dave Henry, Gonzalo Mata, Jeff Wang, Zheng-Shu Zhou, Foivos I. Diakogiannis*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate field boundary delineation is a critical challenge in digital agriculture, impacting everything from crop monitoring to resource management. Existing methods often struggle with noise and fail to generalize across varied landscapes, particularly when dealing with cloud cover in optical remote sensing. In response, this study presents a new approach that leverages time series data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery to improve performance under diverse cloud conditions, without the need for manual cloud filtering. We introduce a 3D Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for satellite image time series, incorporating a memory-efficient attention mechanism. Two models are proposed: PTAViT3D, which handles either S2 or S1 data independently, and PTAViT3D-CA, which fuses both datasets to enhance accuracy. Both models are evaluated under sparse and dense cloud coverage by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the models can effectively delineate field boundaries, even with partial (S2 or S2 and S1 data fusion) or dense cloud cover (S1), with the S1-based model providing performance comparable to S2 imagery in terms of spatial resolution. A key strength of this approach lies in its capacity to directly process cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations in a memory-efficient manner. This methodology, used in the ePaddocks product to map Australia's national field boundaries, offers a robust, scalable solution adaptable to varying agricultural environments, delivering precision and reliability where existing methods falter.

For instance, **SeerAttention** learns intrinsic sparsity in attention, allowing for dynamic adjustment of attention patterns based on input data. This mechanism enhances efficiency for long-context LLMs without significant loss in accuracy.\n- **CASAK-V** introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns, which is crucial for reducing computational complexity and memory usage while maintaining performance.\n- **Zhang et al. (2023)** and **Zhu et al. (2024)**, as mentioned in the analysis note, also propose adaptive sparse attention mechanisms that improve efficiency in long-sequence modeling and reduce inference latency.\n\n## Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Transformers\n\n- While MoE models are well-studied, the idea of hierarchical expert integration is less explored. **FastMoE** provides a system for efficient MoE training but does not specifically address hierarchical structures. The researcher's proposal of hierarchical expert groups with adaptive routing could be novel and offer improved parameter sharing and adaptability.\n- There is a need to conduct focused searches on recent research (2023-2024) exploring hierarchical mixture-of-experts models in transformers, especially those combining adaptive routing and sparse training.\n\n## Sparse Training with Dense Inference\n\n- **Chen et al. (2023)** and **Puigcerver et al. (2023)** propose methods that use sparse mechanisms during training and transition to dense mechanisms during inference, which aligns with the researcher's concept of sparse training with dense inference.\n- These approaches suggest that combining sparse training with dense inference is a viable and current research topic, supporting the novelty of the ASA approach.\n\n## Scale-Aware Position Representations\n\n- The integration of scale-aware position representations in ASA aims to handle varying sequence lengths efficiently. While existing methods focus on position encodings adaptable to different lengths, ASA's method may uniquely combine this with adaptive sparsity and hierarchical experts.\n- **SeerAttention** and **CASAK-V** do not specifically address scale-aware position representations, but their dynamic attention mechanisms could be integrated with such representations to enhance performance.\n\n## Practical Implementation and Hardware Considerations\n\n- Efficient implementation of adaptive sparse attention mechanisms requires addressing hardware constraints. **Li et al. (2020)** emphasize the importance of structuring self-attention to improve efficiency, which is relevant for ASA's design.\n- **Kim et al.

    "abstract": "We propose AdaptiveSparseAttention (ASA), a novel variant of Multi-Head Attention that combines sparse training with dense inference through dynamic sparsity patterns. ASA introduces an adaptive routing mechanism that learns to identify important attention connections during training while maintaining dense computation capabilities during inference. The design incorporates efficient parameter sharing through hierarchical expert groups and employs scale-aware position representations to improve both computational efficiency and model expressiveness.",
