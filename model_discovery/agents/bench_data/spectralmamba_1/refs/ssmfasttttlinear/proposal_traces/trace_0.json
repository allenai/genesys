To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. Retentive network: a successor to transformer for large language models (Avg.

We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Score: 0.94)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Diagonal state spaces are as effective as structured state spaces.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the efficiency and expressiveness of the **FastTTTLinear** Generalized Attention Unit (GAU) in autoregressive language models by integrating concepts from state-space models (SSMs) and recurrent memory mechanisms. Here are the key points and the most relevant information to help achieve this goal:\n\n## Integration of State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Structured State Space Models (S4):** The S4 model, as described in the references, is particularly promising. It uses a diagonal plus low-rank structure in the state matrices, enabling fast computation while capturing long-range dependencies. This aligns well with the researcher's intent to enhance long-sequence modeling efficiency.\n\n- **Mamba Neural Operator (MNO):** The MNO integrates structured state-space models into a neural operator framework, which can be adapted to diverse architectures, including Transformer-based models. This approach demonstrates how SSMs can capture long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively than traditional Transformers, which is crucial for the researcher's goals.\n\n- **MatMamba:** This model combines Matryoshka-style learning with Mamba2, allowing for efficient and adaptive deployment across various model sizes. MatMamba's ability to scale comparably to Transformers while having more efficient inference characteristics is highly relevant for integrating SSMs into transformer architectures.\n\n## Recurrent Memory Mechanisms\n\n- **State Memory Replay (SMR):** SMR utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information, enabling stable modeling of varying sampling points. This technique can be integrated into the **FastTTTLinear** GAU to maintain information over longer sequences (though the specific reference is not provided in the search results, the concept is aligned with the researcher's interests).\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Linear Attention:** The researcher is interested in efficient linear attention mechanisms. State-space models like Mamba and MatMamba offer efficient handling of long-range dependencies, which can be integrated into attention mechanisms to reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional attention.\n\n## Compatibility and Training Implications\n\n- **Compatibility with Transformers:** Ensuring that any modifications are compatible with the existing transformer-based architecture is crucial. The MNO and MatMamba models provide frameworks that are adaptable to Transformer-based architectures, which aligns with the researcher's need to maintain parallelizability and autoregressive nature.\n\n- **Training Dynamics:** The researcher needs to analyze how these changes affect training dynamics, stability, and scalability. The MatMamba model, for instance, allows for joint training and adaptive inference, which can help in managing training overhead and complexity.\n\n## Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n- **Integrate S4 or MNO into Attention Mechanism:** Incorporating the structured state-space design of S4 or MNO into the attention mechanism of **FastTTTLinear** could significantly enhance its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently.\n  \n- **Use Learnable Memory Modules:** Implementing learnable memory modules like those in SMR can help in maintaining information over longer sequences without significant computational overhead.\n  \n- **Adopt Efficient Training and Inference:** Utilize the efficient training and inference characteristics of models like MatMamba to ensure that the modifications do not introduce significant overhead or complicate the training process.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can develop a concrete proposal that integrates state-space models and recurrent memory mechanisms into the **FastTTTLinear** GAU, enhancing its efficiency and expressiveness in long-sequence modeling.\n\n\nWarning: No keywords detected, external search skipped, please wrap your keywords in a quoted block like this: ```keywords {{Your keywods}} ``` in your response next time.\n\nWarning: No description detected, will use full response to search internal library, please wrap your description in a quoted block like this: ```description {{Your description}}``` in your response next time.",

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer \n\nSimiao Zuo ${ }^{* \\ddagger}$, Xiaodong Liu ${ }^{* \\dagger \\wedge}$, Jian Jiao ${ }^{\\dagger \\diamond}$, Denis Charles ${ }^{\\diamond}$, Eren Manavoglu ${ }^{\\wedge}$,<br>Tuo Zhao ${ }^{\\ddagger}$ and Jianfeng Gao ${ }^{\\circ}$<br>${ }^{\\ddagger}$ Georgia Institute of Technology ${ }^{\\diamond}$ Microsoft\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Recurrent architectures Before the advent of transformers, recurrent neural networks, especially Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), were the dominant architectures in NLP for sequence processing. However, traditional RNNs are hard, if not impossible, to parallelize across the time dimension, susceptible to gradient vanishing and explosion, and ineffective in capturing long-range dependencies, which are ubiquitous in natural language. These shortcomings contributed to the rapid decline of traditional RNNs in NLP. There has been a revival of RNNs in NLP research (Tiezzi et al., 2024) in recent years. Compared to transformers with quadratic complexity, RNNs are highly efficient in autoregressive inference with $\\mathrm{O}(1)$ time complexity per step, making them an attractive architecture for large language models. Many efforts have been devoted to parallelized recurrent models and improving their capability to capture long-range dependency, while maintaining the low inference complexity. The Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) (Voelker et al., 2019) was designed to efficiently handle longrange dependencies with a new type of memory cell for recurrent neural networks. Unlike LSTM units, which struggle with remembering information over very long sequences, LMU use Legendre polynomials to create a memory system that can maintain and process information over extended time periods more effectively. High-order polynomial projection operators (HiPPO) (Gu et al., 2020) generalizes LMU by providing a flexible framework for online compression of signals through polynomial projections, accommodating various polynomial bases beyond Legendre polynomials. It optimizes function approximation over time, adapting to different data timescales without needing predefined hyperparameters. SSMs have inspired a range of follow-up research to incorporate SSMs, or modified SSMs into end-to-end architectures for language modeling, including MEGA (Ma et al., 2022), DSS (Gupta et al., 2022), H3 (Fu et al., 2022), and Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) (Orvieto et al., 2023). Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) is a selective SSM that introduces time-dependent selective mechanism to enhance the long-range modeling ability of SSMs. The selectivity removes the linear time-variance property of the SSM, making it no longer possible to parallelize Mamba as a long convolution kernel. Yet Mamba can still be effectively parallelized using parallel associative scan\n(Blelloch, 1990; Martin \\& Cundy, 2018; Smith et al., 2023) with a hardware-aware implementation. Recently proposed GateLoop (Katsch, 2023) also adopts a similar data-dependent state transitions. The data-dependent states, also concurrently proposed in GLA (Yang et al., 2023), are similar to the Weighted Key-Value State in Finch. A contemporary but independent work also proposes recurrent models named as Hawk and Griffin (De et al., 2024). Hawk is a recurrent model with the Real-Gated Linear Recurrent Unit (RG-LRU), whereas Griffin mixes the RG-LRU with local multi-query attention, thereby achieving long-context extrapolation efficiently.

Chen, Vincent Guigue, Alberto Lumbreras, Laure Soulier, Patrick Gallinari*\n\n**Published in:** Conference of the European Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs that effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models are a low-complexity alternative to transformers for encoding long sequences and capturing long-term dependencies. We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 4. Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors (Avg.

However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/31 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1804.03209, 2018.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space transformer*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space transformer*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying\n\n*From Search Query: state space transformer*\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. MATTER: Memory-Augmented Transformer Using Heterogeneous Knowledge Sources\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Dongkyu Lee, Chandana Satya Prakash, Jack FitzGerald, Jens Lehmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an efficient memory-augmented transformer called MATTER, designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources, and demonstrates that this model outperforms existing efficient retrieval-augmented models on popular QA benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed.\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging external knowledge is crucial for achieving high performance in knowledge-intensive tasks, such as question answering. The retrieve-and-read approach is widely adopted for integrating external knowledge into a language model. However, this approach suffers from increased computational cost and latency due to the long context length, which grows proportionally with the number of retrieved knowledge. Furthermore, existing retrieval-augmented models typically retrieve information from a single type of knowledge source, limiting their scalability to diverse knowledge sources with varying structures. In this work, we introduce an efficient memory-augmented transformer called MATTER, designed to retrieve relevant knowledge from multiple heterogeneous knowledge sources. Specifically, our model retrieves and reads from both unstructured sources (paragraphs) and semi-structured sources (QA pairs) in the form of fixed-length neural memories. We demonstrate that our model outperforms existing efficient retrieval-augmented models on popular QA benchmarks in terms of both accuracy and speed. Furthermore, MATTER achieves competitive results compared to conventional read-and-retrieve models while having 100x throughput during inference.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long sequence attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long sequence attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1347  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 7. CAB: Comprehensive Attention Benchmarking on Long Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long sequence attention*\n\n*Jinchao Zhang, Shuyang Jiang, Jiangtao Feng, Lin Zheng, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self,Noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions, and sheds light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved remarkable success in language, image, and speech processing. Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Existing methods\noften rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or\nuse a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge\nsource. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths\nin terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the\nstrength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented\nTransformer (EMAT) -- it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and\nexploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also\nintroduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value\nrepresentations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory\nslots into the transformer.

However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM.

After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks.

MART: Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer for Coherent Video Paragraph Captioning\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Li-Wei Wang, Yelong Shen, Tamara L. Berg, Mohit Bansal, Jie Lei, Dong Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Generating multi-sentence descriptions for videos is one of the most challenging captioning tasks due to its high requirements for not only visual relevance but also discourse-based coherence across the sentences in the paragraph. Towards this goal, we propose a new approach called Memory-Augmented Recurrent Transformer (MART), which uses a memory module to augment the transformer architecture. The memory module generates a highly summarized memory state from the video segments and the sentence history so as to help better prediction of the next sentence (w.r.t. coreference and repetition aspects), thus encouraging coherent paragraph generation. Extensive experiments, human evaluations, and qualitative analyses on two popular datasets ActivityNet Captions and YouCookII show that MART generates more coherent and less repetitive paragraph captions than baseline methods, while maintaining relevance to the input video events.

GMAT: Global Memory Augmentation for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmented transformer*\n\n*Ankit Gupta, Jonathan Berant*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have become ubiquitous in natural language processing thanks to their large capacity, innate parallelism and high performance. The contextualizing component of a Transformer block is the $\\textit{pairwise dot-product}$ attention that has a large $\\Omega(L^2)$ memory requirement for length $L$ sequences, limiting its ability to process long documents. This has been the subject of substantial interest recently, where multiple approximations were proposed to reduce the quadratic memory requirement using sparse attention matrices. In this work, we propose to augment sparse Transformer blocks with a dense attention-based $\\textit{global memory}$ of length $M$ ($\\ll L$) which provides an aggregate global view of the entire input sequence to each position. Our augmentation has a manageable $O(M\\cdot(L+M))$ memory overhead, and can be seamlessly integrated with prior sparse solutions. Moreover, global memory can also be used for sequence compression, by representing a long input sequence with the memory representations only. We empirically show that our method leads to substantial improvement on a range of tasks, including (a) synthetic tasks that require global reasoning, (b) masked language modeling, and (c) reading comprehension.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 5. BurstAttention: An Efficient Distributed Attention Framework for Extremely Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long sequence attention*\n\n*Ao Sun, Maosong Sun, Chuan Shi, Zhiyuan Liu, Cheng Yang, Xu Han, Weilin Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Effective attention modules have played a crucial role in the success of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), but the quadratic time and memory complexities of these attention modules also pose a challenge when processing long sequences. One potential solution for the long sequence problem is to utilize distributed clusters to parallelize the computation of attention modules across multiple devices (e.g., GPUs). However, adopting a distributed approach inevitably introduces extra memory overheads to store local attention results and incurs additional communication costs to aggregate local results into global ones. In this paper, we propose a distributed attention framework named ``BurstAttention'' to optimize memory access and communication operations at both the global cluster and local device levels. In our experiments, we compare BurstAttention with other competitive distributed attention solutions for long sequence processing. The experimental results under different length settings demonstrate that BurstAttention offers significant advantages for processing long sequences compared with these competitive baselines, reducing 40% communication overheads and achieving 1.37 X speedup during training 128K sequence length on 32 X A100.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-14\n\n\n\n#### 6. LSG Attention: Extrapolation of pretrained Transformers to long sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient long sequence attention*\n\n*S\u00e9bastien Harispe, Charles Condevaux*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. They however suffer from a prohibitive limitation due to the self-attention mechanism, inducing $O(n^2)$ complexity with regard to sequence length. To answer this limitation we introduce the LSG architecture which relies on Local, Sparse and Global attention. We show that LSG attention is fast, efficient and competitive in classification and summarization tasks on long documents. Interestingly, it can also be used to adapt existing pretrained models to efficiently extrapolate to longer sequences with no additional training. Along with the introduction of the LSG attention mechanism, we propose tools to train new models and adapt existing ones based on this mechanism.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates state-space models (SSMs) or memory-augmented mechanisms into Transformer architectures, here are the most relevant and useful pieces of information from the provided sources:\n\n## Integrating State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **Mamba Neural Operator (MNO) and Mamba State Space Models**:\n  - The MNO framework combines structured state-space models (SSMs) with neural operators, offering a unified structure that can capture long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics more effectively than traditional Transformers. This is particularly relevant as it shows how SSMs can be integrated to enhance the modeling of long sequences.\n\n- **MatMamba: A Matryoshka State Space Model**:\n  - MatMamba integrates Matryoshka Representation Learning with Mamba2's SSM, creating a flexible, nested architecture. This model allows for efficient and adaptive deployment across various model sizes and retains critical learned representations even when scaled down. This approach could be adapted to improve the efficiency and expressiveness of **FastTTTLinear** in handling long sequences.\n\n## Memory-Augmented Mechanisms\n\n- **Compressive Transformers**:\n  - Although not directly mentioned in the provided sources, the concept of compressive transformers is relevant. However, the idea of using compressed memory mechanisms to retain information over longer contexts without prohibitive computational costs can be inferred from the general discussion on efficient long-sequence modeling. This concept aligns with the researcher's interest in memory-augmented mechanisms.\n\n## Efficient Long Sequence Attention\n\n- **Linear Attention Mechanisms**:\n  - The equivalence between certain linear attention mechanisms and SSMs is highlighted. This suggests that modifying **FastTTTLinear** to use SSM-based computations could reduce complexity while enhancing expressiveness. The work on linear attention mechanisms that allow Transformers to be formulated as RNNs is also relevant, as it enables efficient autoregressive modeling with linear time and constant memory complexity.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures\n\n- **Combining SSMs and Transformers**:\n  - The MNO and MatMamba models demonstrate how SSMs can be combined with Transformer-like architectures to capture long-range dependencies and continuous dynamics effectively. These models offer a unified structure that can adapt to diverse architectures, including Transformer-based models, which is in line with the researcher's goal of integrating SSMs with Transformer architectures.\n\n## Key Insights and Implementation Details\n\n- **MatMamba's Nested Architecture**:\n  - MatMamba's ability to dynamically extract smaller models from a single large model without retraining is particularly useful. This nested architecture allows for flexible scaling and elastic inference, which could be beneficial for **FastTTTLinear** in handling varying sequence lengths and computational resources.\n\n- **MambaIR's Residual State Space Block**:\n  - The Residual State Space Block used in MambaIR for image restoration shows how SSMs can be enhanced with convolution and channel attention to improve feature representation. This could provide insights into how to enhance the feature representation capabilities of **FastTTTLinear** using similar techniques.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Advances and Empirical Evidence**:\n  - It is crucial to review recent literature beyond the current knowledge cutoff to identify new techniques or models that have successfully integrated SSMs or memory mechanisms into Transformers. This includes looking for empirical evidence supporting the effectiveness of these techniques in practical settings.\n\nBy focusing on these points, the researcher can develop a well-grounded proposal to enhance **FastTTTLinear** for efficient and expressive long-sequence modeling:\n\n- **Design Proposal**: Integrate SSM layers inspired by MNO and MatMamba, and consider compressed memory mechanisms to enhance long-sequence modeling.\n- **Address Challenges**: Ensure training stability and evaluate computational implications to prevent significant overhead.\n- **Prepare for Additional Research**: Review recent research and empirical evidence to incorporate the latest advancements into the proposal.\n\nThis approach will help in creating a novel LM block that leverages the strengths of both SSMs and Transformer architectures, leading to improved efficiency and expressiveness in handling long sequences.\n",

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2. LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 3.

The main ideas include introducing grouped-value attention (GVA) head structure, and moving all data-dependent projections to occur in parallel at the beginning of the block. The combination of the modified parallel Mamba block, together with using SSD as the inner SSM layer, results in the Mamba-2 architecture. We investigate Chinchilla scaling laws for Mamba-2 in the same setting as Mamba, finding that it Pareto dominates Mamba and Transformer++ in both perplexity and wall-clock time. We additionally train a family of\n\nMamba-2 models at varying sizes on the Pile, showing that it matches or outperforms Mamba and open source Transformers on standard downstream evaluations. For example, Mamba-2 with 2.7B parameters trained on 300B tokens on the Pile outperforms Mamba-2.8B, Pythia-2.8B and even Pythia-6.9B trained on the same dataset. Systems Optimizations. The SSD framework connects SSMs and Transformers, allowing us to leverage a rich body of work on systems optimizations developed for Transformers (Section 8). - For example, Tensor Parallelism (TP) is an important model parallelism technique to train large Transformer models by splitting each layer across GPUs on the same node. We design Mamba-2 to be TP-friendly, reducing the number of synchronization point per block by half. - For very long sequences whose activations do not fit on one device, sequence parallelism has been developed for the attention blocks. We describe how to train SSMs in general and Mamba-2 in particular with sequence parallelism, by passing the recurrent states between devices. - For finetuning with examples of different lengths, for best efficiency, Transformer requires sophisticated techniques to remove padding tokens and perform attention on variable length sequences. We show how Mamba-2 can be trained with variable sequence lengths efficiently, requiring no padding tokens. Section 9 empirically validates Mamba-2 on language modeling, training efficiency, and a difficult multi-query associative recall task (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024). Finally, in Section 10, we provide an extended related work and discuss potential research directions opened up by our framework.

They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a 1-dimensional sequence $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top}$ through an implicit latent state $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, N)}$. A general discrete form of structured SSMs takes the form of equation (1). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A h_{t-1}+B x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A_{t} h_{t-1}+B_{t} x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C_{t}^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, N)}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}$. Structured SSMs are so named because the $A$ matrix controlling the temporal dynamics must be structured in order to compute this sequence-to-sequence transformation efficiently enough to be used in deep neural networks. The original structures introduced were diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022) and diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which remains the most popular structure. In this work, we use the term state space model (SSM) to refer to structured SSMs. There are many flavors of such SSMs, with deep ties to several major paradigms of neural sequence models such as continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). We provide a brief overview below, and refer to prior work for more context and details (Gu 2023; Gu and Dao 2023). Continuous-time Models. The original structured SSMs originated as continuous-time maps on functions $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto$ $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, rather than operating directly on sequences. In the continuous-time perspective, in equation (1a) the matrices $(A, B)$ are not directly learned but generated from underlying parameters $(\\AA, B)$, along with a parameterized step size $\\Delta$. The \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, \\AA, B)$ are converted to \"discrete parameters\" $(A, B)$ through fixed formulas $A=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\AA)$ and $B=f_{B}(\\Delta, B)$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Remark 1. While our main models adopt the same parameterization and discretization step as prior work (see Gu and Dao (2023) for details), for simplifying exposition and notation we omit it in the rest of this paper. We note that prior work on\nstructured SSMs referred to the continuous parameters $(\\AA$, have changed notation to simplify the presentation and focus directly on the discrete parameters, which govern the main SSM recurrence. Recurrent Models. Equations (1) and (2) take the form of a recurrence which is linear in its input $x$. Structured SSMs can therefore be viewed as types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the linearity endows them with additional properties and allows them to avoid the sequential computation of traditional RNNs. Conversely, despite this simplification, SSMs are still fully expressive as sequence transformations (in the sense of universal approximation) (Kaul 2020; Orvieto et al. 2023; Shida Wang and Xue 2023). Convolutional Models. When the SSM's dynamics are constant through time as in equation (1), the model is called linear time-invariant (LTI). In this case, they are equivalent to convolutions. Thus, SSMs can also be viewed as types of CNNs, but where (i) the convolution kernels are implicitly parameterized through the SSM parameters $(A, B, C)$ and (ii) the convolution kernels are generally global instead of local. Conversely, through classical signal processing theory all sufficiently well-behaved convolutions can be represented as SSMs. Commonly, previous LTI SSMs would use the convolutional mode for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (1) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one step at a time). Selective State Space Models. The form (2) where the parameters $(A, B, C)$ can also vary in time was introduced in Mamba as the selective SSM. Compared to the standard LTI formulation (1), this model can selectively choose to focus on or ignore inputs at every timestep. It was shown to perform much better than LTI SSMs on information-dense data such as language, especially as its state size N increases allowing for more information capacity. However, it can only be computed in recurrent instead of convolutional mode, and requires a careful hardware-aware implementation to be efficient. Even so, it is still less efficient than hardware-friendly models such as CNNs and Transformers because it does not leverage matrix multiplication units, which modern accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are specialized for. While time-invariant SSMs are closely related to continuous, recurrent, and convolutional sequence models, they are not directly related to attention. In this paper, we show a deeper relationship between selective SSMs and attention, and use it to significantly improve the training speed of SSMs while simultaneously allowing for much larger state sizes N . ## Structured SSMs as Sequence Transformations. Definition 2.1. We use the term sequence transformation to refer to a parameterized map on sequences $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ where $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ and $\\theta$ is an arbitrary collection of parameters. T represents the sequence or time axis; subscripts index into the first dimension, e.g. $X_{t}, Y_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P}$. Sequence transformations (e.g. SSMs, or self-attention) are the cornerstone of deep sequence models, where they are incorporated into neural network architectures (e.g. Transformers). The SSM in (1) or (2) is a sequence transformation with $P=1$; it can be generalized to $P>1$ by simply broadcasting across this dimension (in other words, viewing the input as $P$ independent sequences and applying the SSM to each). One can think of $P$ as a head dimension, which we will elaborate on in Section 7. Definition 2.2. We define the SSM operator $\\operatorname{SSM}(A, B, C)=\\operatorname{SSM}\\left(A_{0: T}, B_{0: T}, C_{0: T}\\right)$ as the sequence transformation $X \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})} \\mapsto Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ defined by equation (2). In SSMs, the $N$ dimension is a free parameter called the state size or state dimension. We also call it the state expansion factor, because it expands the size of the input/output by a factor of $N$, with implications for the computational efficiency of these models. Finally, we remark that many types of sequence transformations, such as attention, can be represented as a single matrix multiplication across the sequence dimension. Definition 2.3. We call a sequence transformation $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ a matrix transformation if it can be written in the form $Y=M_{\\theta} X$ where $M$ is a matrix depending on the parameters $\\theta$. We identify the sequence transformation with the matrix $M$, and often drop the dependence on $\\theta$ when clear from context. ### 2.2 Attention\n\nAttention broadly refers to a type of computation that assigns scores to every pair of positions in a sequence, allowing each element to \"attend\" to the rest. By far the most common and important variant of attention is softmax self-attention, which can be defined as\n\n$$\nY=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V\n$$\n\nfor $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, \\mathrm{P})}$. The mechanism of pairwise comparisons (induced by materializing $Q K^{\\top}$ ) leads to the characteristic quadratic training cost of attention. Many variants of attention have been proposed, but all share the underlying core of these attention scores, with various approximations (Tay et al. 2022). The most important variant for this work is linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Roughly speaking, this family of methods drops the softmax by folding it into a kernel feature map, and uses associativity of matrix multiplication to rewrite $\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V=Q \\cdot\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)$. Moreover, in the important case of causal (autoregressive) attention, they show that when the causal mask is incorporated into the left-hand side as $\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V$, where $L$ is the lower-triangular 1's matrix, then the right-hand side can be expanded as a recurrence.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/86 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nY. Fu, et al. 2023; De et al. 2024; Glorioso et al. 2024; Lieber et al. 2024) suggests that a hybrid architecture with both SSM layers and attention layers could improve the model quality over that of a Transformer, or a pure SSM (e.g., Mamba) model, especially for in-context learning. We explore the different ways that SSD layers can be combined with attention and MLP to understand the benefits of each. Empirically we find that having around $10 \\%$ of the total number of layers being attention performs best. Combining SSD layers, attention layers, and MLP also works better than either pure Transformer++ or Mamba-2. SSD and Attention We find that SSD and attention layers are complementary: by themselves (e.g. in the Mamba-2 architecture vs. Transformer++) their performance (measured by perplexity) is nearly the same, but a mixture of SSD and attention layers outperforms the pure Mamba-2 or Transformer++ architecture. We show some results (Table 2) for the 350 M model ( 48 layers) trained to 7B tokens on the Pile with the GPT- 2 tokenizer (same number of parameters, same hyperparameters, same training and validation set). Adding in just a few attention layers already yields notable improvement and strikes the best balance between quality and efficiency. We hypothesize that the SSM layers function well as a general sequence-to-sequence mapping, and attention layers act as a retrieval mechanism to quickly refer to previous tokens in the sequence instead of forcing the model to compress all the context to its memory (SSM states). Table 2: (Combining SSD and Attention Blocks.) Perplexity of a 350 M model with 48 layers, with different number of attention layers. Having around a $10 \\%$ ratio of attention layers performs best. | Num.

Transformer++: 32 attention layers and 32 gated MLP, interleaving. 2. Mamba-2: 64 SSD layers. 3. Mamba-2-MLP: 32 SSD and 32 gated MLP layers, interleaving. 4. Mamba-2-Attention: 58 SSD layers and 6 attention layers (at indices $9,18,27,36,45,56)^{6}$. 5. Mamba-2-MLP-Attention: 28 SSD layers and 4 attention layers, interleaving with 32 gated MLP layers. We report the validation perplexity on the Pile, as well as zero-shot evaluation, in Table 3. In general, the quality of Transformer++ and Mamba-2 models are around the same. We see that adding just 6 attention layers noticeably improves over the pure Mamba-2 model (and over Transformer++). Adding MLP layers reduces model quality, but can (i) speed up training and inference due to the simplicity and hardware-efficiency of the MLP layer (ii) be easier to up-cycle to MoE models by replacing MLP layers with mixture-of-experts. Table 3: (Zero-shot Evaluations.) Best results for each size in bold. We compare different ways SSD, MLP, and attention layers can be combined, evaluated at 2.7 B scale trained to 300 B tokens on the Pile. | MODEl | Token. | PILE <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> PPL $\\downarrow$ | LAMBADA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | HellaSwag <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | PIQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-E <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Arc-C <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | WinoGrande <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | OpenbookQA <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ | Average <br> ACC $\\uparrow$ |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Transformer++ | NeoX | 6.13 | 3.99 | $\\underline{70.3}$ | 66.4 | 75.2 | 67.7 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 63.9 | 40.4 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2 | NeoX | 6.09 | 4.10 | 69.7 | 66.6 | 76.4 | 69.6 | 36.4 | 64.0 | 38.8 | 60.2 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP | NeoX | 6.13 | 4.18 | 69.3 | 65.0 | 76.4 | 68.1 | 37.0 | 63.1 | 38.2 | 59.6 |\n| Mamba-2-Attention | NeoX | 5.95 | 3.85 | 71.1 | 67.8 | $\\underline{75.8}$ | 69.9 | $\\underline{37.8}$ | 65.3 | 39.0 | 61.0 |\n| Mamba-2-MLP-Attention | NeoX | 6.00 | 3.95 | 70.0 | 66.6 | 75.4 | 70.6 | 38.6 | 64.6 | 39.2 | 60.7 |\n\n### 9.3 Speed Benchmarks\n\nWe benchmark the speed of the SSD algorithm against Mamba's scan implementation and FlashAttention-2 (Figure 10). SSD, thanks to its reformulation to use matrix multiplication as a subroutine, can exploit specialized matrix multiplication (matmul) units on GPUs, also known as tensor cores. As a result, it is 2-8\u00d7 faster than Mamba's fused associative scan, which does not leverage matmul units. Due to its linear scaling in sequence length, SSD is faster than FlashAttention-2 starting at sequence length $2 K$. However, we note that the Mamba-2 model as a whole might not be as efficient to train as Transformer at short sequence length (e.g. at $2 K$ ), since a Transformer with $L$ layers would have $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ attention layers, while a Mamba- 2 model would have $L$ SSD layers for the same number of parameters. Generally the MLP layers are very hardware efficient since they consist of simple matrix multiplication and pointwise linearity. As shown in Section 9.2.3, one can also combine $\\frac{L}{2}$ SSD layers and $\\frac{L}{2}$ MLP layers to speed up training at short sequence length. [^4]Table 4: (Ablations: Mamba-2 block.) We ablate the major differences between the Mamba-2 and Mamba-1 neural network blocks (Figure 6, Section 7.1). Note that these components are independent of the inner sequence mixing layer; in these ablations, we use SSD for the inner SSM layer (differing from the S6 layer of Mamba-1). | Block | ABCX Projections | Extra Normalization | Parameters | Perplexity |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| Mamba-1 | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 129.3 M | 11.76 |\n|  | Sequential | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 129.3 M | 11.54 |\n|  | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{X}$ | 126.5 M | 11.66 |\n| Mamba-2 | Parallel | $\\boldsymbol{\\checkmark}$ | 126.5 M | 11.49 |\n\n### 9.4 Architecture Ablations\n\n### 9.4.1 Block Design\n\nSection 7.1 introduces the Mamba-2 block, which has small modifications to the Mamba-1 block which are partly motivated by the connection to attention and also to improve the scalability of Mamba-2. Table 4 ablates these architecture changes to the block, which occur outside of the core SSM layer. The ablations validate that parallel projections to create $(A, B, C, X)$ saves parameters and performs slightly better than Mamba's sequential projections. More importantly, this modification is amenable to tensor parallelism at larger model sizes (Section 8). Additionally, the extra normalization layer also slightly improves performance. More importantly, preliminary experiments at larger scales observed that it also helps with training stability. ### 9.4.2 Head Structure\n\nSection 7.2 describes how the dimensions of the $B, C, X$ projections can be viewed as a hyperparameter analogous to notions of multi-head attention and multi-query attention. We also showed how the original Mamba architecture is analogous to multi-value attention (Proposition 7.2), which was a choice that naturally developed from the state-space model point of view and was not previously ablated. Table 5 ablates choices of the multi-head structure for the Mamba-2 architecture. Strikingly, we find a large difference between multi-value and multi-query or multi-key head patterns, despite seeming very similar. Note that this is not explained by the total state size, which is the same for all of them (equal to HPN or the product of the number of heads, head dimension, and state dimension). We also compare to multi-head patterns where the number of $C, B, X$ (analogous to $Q, K, V$ ) heads is equal. We compare against the standard multi-head pattern, as well as one with aggressive sharing where they all have only 1 head. Note that in the latter case, the model still has H different sequence mixers $M$, because each head still has a different $A$. When parameter matched, these multi-head patterns perform similarly to each other, in between the MVA and MQA/MKA patterns. ### 9.4.3 Attention Kernel Approximations\n\nSection 7.3 noted how SSD can be combined with ideas from the linear attention literature, such as various forms of kernel approximations. We ablate several variants of these suggested by previous works in Table 6. These include the cosFormer (Qin, Weixuan Sun, et al. 2022), Random Feature Attention H. Peng et al. 2021, and Positive Random Features (Performer) (Choromanski et al. 2021). We also ablate adding a normalization term, akin to the denominator of the softmax function in standard attention. We found that this introduced instabilities to most variants, but slightly improved performance for the ReLU activation function $\\psi$. Table 7 also tests more recent proposals to improve linear attention that involve expanding the feature dimension (Based (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024) and ReBased (Aksenov et al. 2024)). These linear attention extensions aim to appropriate the $\\exp$ kernel with a quadratic approximation. ReBased also proposes to replace the QK activation function with a layer normalization; from an SSM-centric view we apply a normalization on top of $(B, C)$ before applying the SSM function. Table 5: (Ablations: Multi-head structure.) All models have state expansion factor $N=64$ and head size $P=64$ and are trained to Chinchilla scaling law token counts. The number of $A$ heads is always equal to the total heads H , i.e. each head has a separate input-dependent $A$ decay factor.

Overall, Table 6 and Table 7 found that the kernel approximation methods we tried did not seem to improve over simple pointwise non-linear activation functions for $\\psi$. Thus our default settings for Mamba-2 used $\\psi(x)=$ Swish $(x)$ to follow Mamba-1, but we suggest that removing this activation entirely may be a simpler choice that we did not extensively test. We emphasize however that SSD and vanilla linear attention differ in the inclusion of the 1-semiseparable mask $L$, while the various linear attention methods in the literature were derived to approximate softmax attention without this term; thus, our negative results may be not unexpected. ## 10 Related Work and Discussion\n\nThe state space duality framework bridges connections between SSMs, structured matrices, and attention. We discuss in more depth the relations between SSD and these concepts more broadly. Using ideas from each of the viewpoints, we also suggest some directions that the SSD framework can be extended in future work. ### 10.1 State Space Models\n\nStructured state space models can be characterized along the axes\n(i) whether it is time-invariant or time-varying.\n```\n\n#### 4.

We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions.

[^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

This is crucial for ensuring that the modified **FastTTTLinear** remains efficient during training and inference.\n\n### Training Stability and Computational Overhead\nIntegrating SSMs or memory modules may introduce training complexities. Ensuring appropriate initialization, normalization, and regularization techniques is necessary to maintain training stability. Additionally, efficient algorithms and optimizations are essential to avoid significant computational overhead.\n\n## Recent Advances and Future Search\n\n### Latest Research\nRecent research such as the Mamba Neural Operator and MatMamba models highlights the ongoing advancements in integrating SSMs with Transformers. These models offer new techniques for efficient long-sequence modeling, such as the use of structured state-space models and nested dimensions, which can be explored further to enhance **FastTTTLinear**.\n\n### Implementation Details\nSeeking out code repositories and detailed descriptions of models like SPADE, LOCOST, and Mamba can provide practical insights into how to integrate these mechanisms into **FastTTTLinear**.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Integrating State-Space Models (SSMs):**\n\n  - **SPADE Model:** Augments Transformer architectures with SSM layers at the bottom, using SSMs to capture global, long-range dependencies efficiently. This highlights the potential of integrating an SSM layer into **FastTTTLinear** to enhance its ability to model long sequences.\n\n  - **LOCOST Model:** Demonstrates that an encoder based entirely on SSMs can handle extremely long sequences (up to 600K tokens) with reduced memory usage. Incorporating SSMs into **FastTTTLinear** could significantly improve its capacity for long-context modeling while maintaining efficiency.\n\n  - **State Space Duality (SSD) Framework:** Shows that SSMs and Transformers are closely related and that SSMs can be used to design efficient architectures like Mamba-2. This suggests that rethinking **FastTTTLinear** within the SSD framework could lead to performance gains and efficiency improvements.\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Mechanisms:**\n\n  - **Compressive Transformers:** Introduce a compressed memory to store past activations, enabling the model to retain long-range information without high computational costs. Adding a compressed memory mechanism to **FastTTTLinear** could enhance its capacity to model long-term dependencies.\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures:**\n\n  - **Combining SSMs with Transformers:** Models like SPADE and LOCOST successfully integrate SSMs into Transformer architectures, suggesting that a similar approach can be applied to **FastTTTLinear**. Hybrid architectures can capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms:**\n\n  - **Linearizing Attention:** Techniques that linearize attention mechanisms, such as those proposed by Heinsen (2024), can reduce computational complexity. Incorporating linear attention into **FastTTTLinear** may improve efficiency for long sequences.\n\n  - **State Space Models as Attention:** The SSD framework demonstrates that attention mechanisms and SSMs can be viewed under a unified framework. Leveraging this insight, **FastTTTLinear** can be redesigned to use SSMs as efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n  - **Training Stability:** Introducing SSMs or memory mechanisms may affect training dynamics. Proper initialization, normalization, and regularization techniques are necessary to ensure stable training.\n\n  - **Computational Overhead:** Modifications should not significantly increase computational costs. Efficient implementation of SSMs and memory mechanisms is crucial.\n\n  - **Model Compatibility:** Ensuring that the modified **FastTTTLinear** remains compatible with the autoregressive structure and maintains parallelizability is essential.\n\n- **Potential Modification Strategies:**\n\n  - **Integrate an SSM Layer:** Add an SSM layer to **FastTTTLinear** to capture global dependencies. This could involve replacing or augmenting existing components with SSM computations.\n\n  - **Incorporate Compressed Memory:** Introduce a compressed memory mechanism to store and retrieve long-term information efficiently.\n\n  - **Leverage SSD Framework:** Reframe **FastTTTLinear** within the SSD framework to unify attention and SSM computations, potentially leading to more efficient algorithms.\n\n---\n\n**4.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 3. LOCOST: State-Space Models for Long Document Abstractive Summarization (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Florian Le Bronnec, Song Duong, Mathieu Ravaut, Alexandre Allauzen, Nancy F.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Integrating State-Space Models (SSMs):**\n\n  - **SPADE Model:** Augments Transformer architectures with SSM layers at the bottom, using SSMs to capture global, long-range dependencies efficiently. This highlights the potential of integrating an SSM layer into **FastTTTLinear** to enhance its ability to model long sequences.\n\n  - **LOCOST Model:** Demonstrates that an encoder based entirely on SSMs can handle extremely long sequences (up to 600K tokens) with reduced memory usage. Incorporating SSMs into **FastTTTLinear** could significantly improve its capacity for long-context modeling while maintaining efficiency.\n\n  - **State Space Duality (SSD) Framework:** Shows that SSMs and Transformers are closely related and that SSMs can be used to design efficient architectures like Mamba-2. This suggests that rethinking **FastTTTLinear** within the SSD framework could lead to performance gains and efficiency improvements.\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Mechanisms:**\n\n  - **Compressive Transformers:** Introduce a compressed memory to store past activations, enabling the model to retain long-range information without high computational costs. Adding a compressed memory mechanism to **FastTTTLinear** could enhance its capacity to model long-term dependencies.\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures:**\n\n  - **Combining SSMs with Transformers:** Models like SPADE and LOCOST successfully integrate SSMs into Transformer architectures, suggesting that a similar approach can be applied to **FastTTTLinear**. Hybrid architectures can capture both local and global dependencies effectively.\n\n- **Efficient Attention Mechanisms:**\n\n  - **Linearizing Attention:** Techniques that linearize attention mechanisms, such as those proposed by Heinsen (2024), can reduce computational complexity. Incorporating linear attention into **FastTTTLinear** may improve efficiency for long sequences.\n\n  - **State Space Models as Attention:** The SSD framework demonstrates that attention mechanisms and SSMs can be viewed under a unified framework. Leveraging this insight, **FastTTTLinear** can be redesigned to use SSMs as efficient attention mechanisms.\n\n- **Challenges and Considerations:**\n\n  - **Training Stability:** Introducing SSMs or memory mechanisms may affect training dynamics. Proper initialization, normalization, and regularization techniques are necessary to ensure stable training.\n\n  - **Computational Overhead:** Modifications should not significantly increase computational costs. Efficient implementation of SSMs and memory mechanisms is crucial.\n\n  - **Model Compatibility:** Ensuring that the modified **FastTTTLinear** remains compatible with the autoregressive structure and maintains parallelizability is essential.\n\n- **Potential Modification Strategies:**\n\n  - **Integrate an SSM Layer:** Add an SSM layer to **FastTTTLinear** to capture global dependencies. This could involve replacing or augmenting existing components with SSM computations.\n\n  - **Incorporate Compressed Memory:** Introduce a compressed memory mechanism to store and retrieve long-term information efficiently.\n\n  - **Leverage SSD Framework:** Reframe **FastTTTLinear** within the SSD framework to unify attention and SSM computations, potentially leading to more efficient algorithms.\n\n---\n\n**4. Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps**\n\nGiven the comprehensive information gathered, I believe I have sufficient insights to formulate a proposal for modifying **FastTTTLinear**. My next steps are:\n\n- **Design the Modified Architecture:**\n\n  - Develop a concrete plan to integrate an SSM layer or mechanism into **FastTTTLinear**, drawing inspiration from SPADE, LOCOST, and the SSD framework.\n\n  - Ensure that the proposed modifications enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities without introducing significant computational overhead.\n\n- **Address Challenges:**\n\n  - Consider training stability and propose solutions such as appropriate normalization techniques or architectural adjustments.\n\n  - Plan for efficient implementation to maintain or improve computational efficiency.\n\n- **Prepare the Proposal:**\n\n  - Write a detailed proposal outlining the motivation, related work, problem analysis, design plan, implementation guidelines, and expected benefits.\n\n  - Include theoretical justifications and, if possible, preliminary mathematical formulations of the proposed modifications.\n\n---\n\n**5.

Weighted Grouped Query Attention in Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.86)\n\n*Sai Sena Chinnakonduru, Astarag Mohapatra*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA), is proposed, introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning.\n\n**Abstract:** The attention mechanism forms the foundational blocks for transformer language models. Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/38 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2001.04451, 2020.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Chen, D. Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This synergistic framework L2ight is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips.\n\n**Abstract:** Silicon-photonics-based optical neural network (ONN) is a promising hardware platform that could represent a paradigm shift in efficient AI with its CMOS-compatibility, flexibility, ultra-low execution latency, and high energy efficiency. In-situ training on the online programmable photonic chips is appealing but still encounters challenging issues in on-chip implementability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose a closed-loop ONN on-chip learning framework L2ight to enable scalable ONN mapping and efficient in-situ learning. L2ight adopts a three-stage learning flow that first calibrates the complicated photonic circuit states under challenging physical constraints, then performs photonic core mapping via combined analytical solving and zeroth-order optimization. A subspace learning procedure with multi-level sparsity is integrated into L2ight to enable in-situ gradient evaluation and fast adaptation, unleashing the power of optics for real on-chip intelligence. Extensive experiments demonstrate our proposed L2ight outperforms prior ONN training protocols with 3-order-of-magnitude higher scalability and over 30X better efficiency, when benchmarked on various models and learning tasks. This synergistic framework is the first scalable on-chip learning solution that pushes this emerging field from intractable to scalable and further to efficient for next-generation self-learnable photonic neural chips. From a co-design perspective, L2ight also provides essential insights for hardware-restricted unitary subspace optimization and efficient sparse training.

Temporal Effective Batch Normalization in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Chaoteng Duan, Jianhao Ding, Shiyan Chen, Zhaofei Yu, Tiejun Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising in neuromorphic hardware owing to utilizing spatio-temporal information and sparse event-driven signal processing. However, it is challenging to train SNNs due to the non-differentiable nature of the binary firing function. The surrogate gradients alleviate the training problem and make SNNs obtain comparable performance as Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) with the same structure. Unfortunately, batch normalization, contributing to the success of ANNs, does not play a prominent role in SNNs because of the additional temporal dimension. To this end, we propose an effective normalization method called temporal effective batch normalization (TEBN). By rescaling the presynaptic inputs with different weights at every time-step, temporal distributions become smoother and uniform. Theoretical analysis shows that TEBN can be viewed as a smoother of SNN\u2019s optimization landscape and could help stabilize the gradient norm. Experimental results on both static and neuromorphic datasets show that SNNs with TEBN outperform the state-of-the-art accuracy with fewer time-steps, and achieve better robustness to hyper-parameters than other normalizations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 62  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4.

As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6311  (*Influential: 1115*)\n\n#### 5.

To address this, we propose a framework, Language Models Augmented with Long-Term Memory (LongMem), which enables LLMs to memorize long history. We design a novel decoupled network architecture with the original backbone LLM frozen as a memory encoder and an adaptive residual side-network as a memory retriever and reader. Such a decoupled memory design can easily cache and update long-term past contexts for memory retrieval without suffering from memory staleness. Enhanced with memory-augmented adaptation training, LongMem can thus memorize long past context and use long-term memory for language modeling. The proposed memory retrieval module can handle unlimited-length context in its memory bank to benefit various downstream tasks. Typically, LongMem can enlarge the long-form memory to 65k tokens and thus cache many-shot extra demonstration examples as long-form memory for in-context learning. Experiments show that our method outperforms strong long-context models on ChapterBreak, a challenging long-context modeling benchmark, and achieves remarkable improvements on memory-augmented in-context learning over LLMs. The results demonstrate that the proposed method is effective in helping language models to memorize and utilize long-form contents.

However, existing training procedures are limited to images of low resolution (typically below 32x32), and can be unstable under some settings. We provide a new theoretical analysis of learning and sampling from score models in high dimensional spaces, explaining existing failure modes and motivating new solutions that generalize across datasets. To enhance stability, we also propose to maintain an exponential moving average of model weights. With these improvements, we can effortlessly scale score-based generative models to images with unprecedented resolutions ranging from 64x64 to 256x256. Our score-based models can generate high-fidelity samples that rival best-in-class GANs on various image datasets, including CelebA, FFHQ, and multiple LSUN categories.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 946  (*Influential: 114*)\n\n#### 7. Improving Stability of Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models via Component-Wise Gradient Norm Clipping\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability improvements\"*\n\n*Chenghao Yang, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components, which achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning over large pretrained language models (PLMs) has established many state-of-the-art results. Despite its superior performance, such fine-tuning can be unstable, resulting in significant variance in performance and potential risks for practical applications. Previous works have attributed such instability to the catastrophic forgetting problem in the top layers of PLMs, which indicates iteratively fine-tuning layers in a top-down manner is a promising solution. In this paper, we first point out that this method does not always work out due to the different convergence speeds of different layers/modules. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.

Why Spectral Normalization Stabilizes GANs: Analysis and Improvements\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability improvements\"*\n\n*Zinan Lin, Vyas Sekar, G. Fanti*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients, and proposes Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral normalization (SN) is a widely-used technique for improving the stability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) by forcing each layer of the discriminator to have unit spectral norm. This approach controls the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator, and is empirically known to improve sample quality in many GAN architectures. However, there is currently little understanding of why SN is so effective. In this work, we show that SN controls two important failure modes of GAN training: exploding and vanishing gradients. Our proofs illustrate a (perhaps unintentional) connection with the successful LeCun initialization technique, proposed over two decades ago to control gradients in the training of deep neural networks. This connection helps to explain why the most popular implementation of SN for GANs requires no hyperparameter tuning, whereas stricter implementations of SN have poor empirical performance out-of-the-box. Unlike LeCun initialization which only controls gradient vanishing at the beginning of training, we show that SN tends to preserve this property throughout training. Finally, building on this theoretical understanding, we propose Bidirectional Spectral Normalization (BSN), a modification of SN inspired by Xavier initialization, a later improvement to LeCun initialization. Theoretically, we show that BSN gives better gradient control than SN. Empirically, we demonstrate that BSN outperforms SN in sample quality on several benchmark datasets, while also exhibiting better training stability.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

On the efficient representation and execution of deep acoustic models\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Raziel Alvarez, Rohit Prabhavalkar, Anton Bakhtin*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we present a simple and computationally efficient quantization\nscheme that enables us to reduce the resolution of the parameters of a neural\nnetwork from 32-bit floating point values to 8-bit integer values. The proposed\nquantization scheme leads to significant memory savings and enables the use of\noptimized hardware instructions for integer arithmetic, thus significantly\nreducing the cost of inference. Finally, we propose a \"quantization aware\"\ntraining process that applies the proposed scheme during network training and\nfind that it allows us to recover most of the loss in accuracy introduced by\nquantization.

Recent work doing\nincremental coreference resolution using just the global representation of\nentities shows practical benefits but requires keeping all entities in memory,\nwhich can be impractical for long documents. We argue that keeping all entities\nin memory is unnecessary, and we propose a memory-augmented neural network that\ntracks only a small bounded number of entities at a time, thus guaranteeing a\nlinear runtime in length of document. We show that (a) the model remains\ncompetitive with models with high memory and computational requirements on\nOntoNotes and LitBank, and (b) the model learns an efficient memory management\nstrategy easily outperforming a rule-based strategy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-06T15:16:31Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-17T02:31:30Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for\n  Long-Range Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management language models\"*\n\n*Chao Lou, Zixia Jia, Zilong Zheng, Kewei Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Accommodating long sequences efficiently in autoregressive Transformers,\nespecially within an extended context window, poses significant challenges due\nto the quadratic computational complexity and substantial KV memory\nrequirements inherent in self-attention mechanisms. In this work, we introduce\nSPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome\nthese computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our\napproach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator,\nSPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby\nenabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers\nlinear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation.\nExperimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse\nattention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both\ntraining and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks.\nFurthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution\nfor effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-24T15:55:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

To address these problems, the ESimCSE\nunsupervised comparative learning and UDA semi-supervised comparative learning\nmodels are combined through the use of joint training techniques in the\nmodels.The ESimCSE model efficiently learns text vector representations using\nunlabeled data to achieve better classification results, while UDA is trained\nusing unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning methods to improve the\nprediction performance of the models and stability, and further improve the\ngeneralization ability of the model. In addition, adversarial training\ntechniques FGM and PGD are used in the model training process to improve the\nrobustness and reliability of the model.

Multi-head or Single-head? An Empirical Comparison for Transformer\n  Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"training stability improvements\"*\n\n*Liyuan Liu, Jialu Liu, Jiawei Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head attention plays a crucial role in the recent success of\nTransformer models, which leads to consistent performance improvements over\nconventional attention in various applications. The popular belief is that this\neffectiveness stems from the ability of jointly attending multiple positions.\nIn this paper, we first demonstrate that jointly attending multiple positions\nis not a unique feature of multi-head attention, as multi-layer single-head\nattention also attends multiple positions and is more effective. Then, we\nsuggest the main advantage of the multi-head attention is the training\nstability, since it has less number of layers than the single-head attention,\nwhen attending the same number of positions. For example, 24-layer 16-head\nTransformer (BERT-large) and 384-layer single-head Transformer has the same\ntotal attention head number and roughly the same model size, while the\nmulti-head one is significantly shallower. Meanwhile, we show that, with recent\nadvances in deep learning, we can successfully stabilize the training of the\n384-layer Transformer. As the training difficulty is no longer a bottleneck,\nsubstantially deeper single-head Transformer achieves consistent performance\nimprovements without tuning hyper-parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-17T16:53:22Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-17T16:53:22Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-Component Optimization and Efficient Deployment of Neural-Networks on Resource-Constrained IoT Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Rajiv Ranjan, Albert Zomaya, Schahram Dustdar, Muhammad Intizar Ali, John G. Breslin, Pankesh Patel, Dineshkumar Sundaram, Bharath Sudharsan*\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of IoT devices like smartwatches, smart plugs, HVAC controllers, etc., are powered by hardware with a constrained specification (low memory, clock speed and processor) which is insufficient to accommodate and execute large, high-quality models. On such resource-constrained devices, manufacturers still manage to provide attractive functionalities (to boost sales) by following the traditional approach of programming IoT devices/products to collect and transmit data (image, audio, sensor readings, etc.) to their cloud-based ML analytics platforms. For decades, this online approach has been facing issues such as compromised data streams, non-real-time analytics due to latency, bandwidth constraints, costly subscriptions, recent privacy issues raised by users and the GDPR guidelines, etc. In this paper, to enable ultra-fast and accurate AI-based offline analytics on resource-constrained IoT devices, we present an end-to-end multi-component model optimization sequence and open-source its implementation. Researchers and developers can use our optimization sequence to optimize high memory, computation demanding models in multiple aspects in order to produce small size, low latency, low-power consuming models that can comfortably fit and execute on resource-constrained hardware. The experimental results show that our optimization components can produce models that are; (i) 12.06 x times compressed; (ii) 0.13% to 0.27% more accurate; (iii) Orders of magnitude faster unit inference at 0.06 ms.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware optimization neural networks\"*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficient Memory Management for Large Language Model Serving with PagedAttention\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory management language models\"*\n\n*Ion Stoica, Hao Zhang, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Cody Hao Yu, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng, Siyuan Zhuang, Zhuohan Li, Woosuk Kwon*\n\n**Abstract:** High throughput serving of large language models (LLMs) requires batching sufficiently many requests at a time. However, existing systems struggle because the key-value cache (KV cache) memory for each request is huge and grows and shrinks dynamically. When managed inefficiently, this memory can be significantly wasted by fragmentation and redundant duplication, limiting the batch size. To address this problem, we propose PagedAttention, an attention algorithm inspired by the classical virtual memory and paging techniques in operating systems. On top of it, we build vLLM, an LLM serving system that achieves (1) near-zero waste in KV cache memory and (2) flexible sharing of KV cache within and across requests to further reduce memory usage. Our evaluations show that vLLM improves the throughput of popular LLMs by 2-4$\\times$ with the same level of latency compared to the state-of-the-art systems, such as FasterTransformer and Orca. The improvement is more pronounced with longer sequences, larger models, and more complex decoding algorithms. vLLM's source code is publicly available at https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-12\n\n\n\n#### 4.

However, existing LLMs lack a dedicated memory unit, limiting their ability to explicitly store and retrieve knowledge for various tasks. In this paper, we propose RET-LLM a novel framework that equips LLMs with a general write-read memory unit, allowing them to extract, store, and recall knowledge from the text as needed for task performance. Inspired by Davidsonian semantics theory, we extract and save knowledge in the form of triplets. The memory unit is designed to be scalable, aggregatable, updatable, and interpretable. Through qualitative evaluations, we demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework over baseline approaches in question answering tasks. Moreover, our framework exhibits robust performance in handling temporal-based question answering tasks, showcasing its ability to effectively manage time-dependent information.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Chi, Lichan Hong, Xinyang Yi, Li Wei, Justin Gilmer, Maheswaran Sathiamoorthy, Daryl Chang, Yoel Drori, Jiaxi Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recommender systems play an important role in many content platforms. While most recommendation research is dedicated to designing better models to improve user experience, we found that research on stabilizing the training for such models is severely under-explored. As recommendation models become larger and more sophisticated, they are more susceptible to training instability issues, i.e., loss divergence, which can make the model unusable, waste significant resources and block model developments. In this paper, we share our findings and best practices we learned for improving the training stability of a real-world multitask ranking model for YouTube recommendations. We show some properties of the model that lead to unstable training and conjecture on the causes. Furthermore, based on our observations of training dynamics near the point of training instability, we hypothesize why existing solutions would fail, and propose a new algorithm to mitigate the limitations of existing solutions. Our experiments on YouTube production dataset show the proposed algorithm can significantly improve training stability while not compromising convergence, comparing with several commonly used baseline methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-17\n\n\n\n#### 6.

In this view, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) techniques have been widely employed and growing interest to the researchers day by day. ANN training aims to find the proper setting of parameters such as weights ($\\textbf{W}$) and biases ($b$) to properly classify the given data samples. The training process is formulated in an error minimization problem which consists of many local optima in the search landscape. In this paper, an enhanced Particle Swarm Optimization is proposed to minimize the error function for classifying real-life data sets. A stability analysis is performed to establish the efficiency of the proposed method for improving classification accuracy. The performance measurement such as confusion matrix, $F$-measure and convergence graph indicates the significant improvement in the classification accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on hardware optimization, memory management, training stability, and efficient implementations, here are some key points and references that can be particularly useful:\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for Neural Networks\n\n- **Specialized Hardware**: Utilizing GPUs, TPUs, NPUs, and FPGAs can significantly enhance the performance of neural networks.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 5.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"state space models attention hybrid\", \"SSM transformer integration\", \"efficient long sequence modeling\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Recent advancements in SR have demonstrated the effectiveness of pre-trained transformer-based models in generating equations as sequences, leveraging large-scale pre-training on synthetic datasets and offering notable advantages in terms of inference time over classical Genetic Programming (GP) methods. However, these models primarily rely on supervised pre-training goals borrowed from text generation and overlook equation discovery objectives like accuracy and complexity. To address this, we propose TPSR, a Transformer-based Planning strategy for Symbolic Regression that incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search into the transformer decoding process. Unlike conventional decoding strategies, TPSR enables the integration of non-differentiable feedback, such as fitting accuracy and complexity, as external sources of knowledge into the transformer-based equation generation process.

Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work.

Advanced SSMs like S5 and S6 (Mamba) in addressing non-uniform sampling, their recursive structures impede efficient SSM computation via convolution. To overcome compatibility limitations in parallel convolutional computation, this paper proposes a novel non-recursive non-uniform sample processing strategy. Theoretical analysis of SSMs through the lens of Event-Triggered Control (ETC) theory reveals the Non-Stable State (NSS) problem, where deviations from sampling point requirements lead to error transmission and accumulation, causing the divergence of the SSM's hidden state. Our analysis further reveals that adjustments of input sequences with early memories can mitigate the NSS problem, achieving Sampling Step Adaptation (SSA). Building on this insight, we introduce a simple yet effective plug-and-play mechanism, State Memory Replay (SMR), which utilizes learnable memories to adjust the current state with multi-step information for generalization at sampling points different from those in the training data. This enables SSMs to stably model varying sampling points. Experiments on long-range modeling tasks in autoregressive language modeling and Long Range Arena demonstrate the general effectiveness of the SMR mechanism for a series of SSM models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Recently, various efficient attention architectures have been proposed to improve transformer's efficiency while largely preserving its efficacy, especially in modeling long sequences. A widely-used benchmark to test these efficient methods' capability on long-range modeling is Long Range Arena (LRA). However, LRA only focuses on the standard bidirectional (or noncausal) self attention, and completely ignores cross attentions and unidirectional (or causal) attentions, which are equally important to downstream applications. In this paper, we propose Comprehensive Attention Benchmark (CAB) under a fine-grained attention taxonomy with four distinguishable attention patterns, namely, noncausal self, causal self, noncausal cross, and causal cross attentions. CAB collects seven real-world tasks from different research areas to evaluate efficient attentions under the four attention patterns. Among these tasks, CAB validates efficient attentions in eight backbone networks to show their generalization across neural architectures. We conduct exhaustive experiments to benchmark the performances of nine widely-used efficient attention architectures designed with different philosophies on CAB. Extensive experimental results also shed light on the fundamental problems of efficient attentions, such as efficiency length against vanilla attention, performance consistency across attention patterns, the benefit of attention mechanisms, and interpolation/extrapolation on long-context language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"state space models attention hybrid\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational\nnetwork architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance\nhas yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a\nnovel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in\nSSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers,\nDenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense\nconnections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability\nand inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to\nvarious SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

In this work, we focus on cases where generation is conditioned on\nboth a short query and a long context, such as abstractive question answering\nor document-level translation. We modify the standard sequence-to-sequence\napproach to make better use of both the query and the context by expanding the\nconditioning mechanism to intertwine query and context attention. We also\nintroduce a simple and efficient data augmentation method for the proposed\nmodel.

Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient long sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Simiao Zuo, Xiaodong Liu, Jian Jiao, Denis Charles, Eren Manavoglu, Tuo Zhao, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural\nlanguage processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the\nattention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are\nexisting attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they\nhave limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to\nTransformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences,\nbut they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information.

An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"state space models attention hybrid\"*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jan Kautz, Jared Casper, Vartika Singh, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Deepak Narayanan, Sudhakar Singh, Ali Hatamizadeh, Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Vijay Korthikanti, Brandon Norick, Duncan Riach, Wonmin Byeon, Roger Waleffe*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM transformer integration\"*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mamba-FETrack: Frame-Event Tracking via State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM transformer integration\"*\n\n*Bo Jiang, Xiao Wang, Zhe Wu, Shuai Wang, Shiao Wang, Ju Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** RGB-Event based tracking is an emerging research topic, focusing on how to effectively integrate heterogeneous multi-modal data (synchronized exposure video frames and asynchronous pulse Event stream). Existing works typically employ Transformer based networks to handle these modalities and achieve decent accuracy through input-level or feature-level fusion on multiple datasets. However, these trackers require significant memory consumption and computational complexity due to the use of self-attention mechanism. This paper proposes a novel RGB-Event tracking framework, Mamba-FETrack, based on the State Space Model (SSM) to achieve high-performance tracking while effectively reducing computational costs and realizing more efficient tracking. Specifically, we adopt two modality-specific Mamba backbone networks to extract the features of RGB frames and Event streams. Then, we also propose to boost the interactive learning between the RGB and Event features using the Mamba network. The fused features will be fed into the tracking head for target object localization. Extensive experiments on FELT and FE108 datasets fully validated the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed tracker. Specifically, our Mamba-based tracker achieves 43.5/55.6 on the SR/PR metric, while the ViT-S based tracker (OSTrack) obtains 40.0/50.9. The GPU memory cost of ours and ViT-S based tracker is 13.98GB and 15.44GB, which decreased about $9.5\\%$. The FLOPs and parameters of ours/ViT-S based OSTrack are 59GB/1076GB and 7MB/60MB, which decreased about $94.5\\%$ and $88.3\\%$, respectively. We hope this work can bring some new insights to the tracking field and greatly promote the application of the Mamba architecture in tracking.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient long sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dual-path RNN: efficient long sequence modeling for time-domain single-channel speech separation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient long sequence modeling\"*\n\n*Zhuo Chen, Yi Luo, Takuya Yoshioka*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies in deep learning-based speech separation have proven the superiority of time-domain approaches to conventional time-frequency-based methods. Unlike the time-frequency domain approaches, the time-domain separation systems often receive input sequences consisting of a huge number of time steps, which introduces challenges for modeling extremely long sequences. Conventional recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are not effective for modeling such long sequences due to optimization difficulties, while one-dimensional convolutional neural networks (1-D CNNs) cannot perform utterance-level sequence modeling when its receptive field is smaller than the sequence length. In this paper, we propose dual-path recurrent neural network (DPRNN), a simple yet effective method for organizing RNN layers in a deep structure to model extremely long sequences. DPRNN splits the long sequential input into smaller chunks and applies intra- and inter-chunk operations iteratively, where the input length can be made proportional to the square root of the original sequence length in each operation. Experiments show that by replacing 1-D CNN with DPRNN and apply sample-level modeling in the time-domain audio separation network (TasNet), a new state-of-the-art performance on WSJ0-2mix is achieved with a 20 times smaller model than the previous best system.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state-space models (SSMs) and hybrid architectures, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of State-Space Models with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper introducing **Taipan** presents a hybrid architecture that combines Mamba-2 (a state-space model) with Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This integration allows Taipan to balance the efficiency of SSMs with the long-range dependency handling of Transformers, addressing the limitations of SSMs in tasks requiring in-context retrieval and complex long-range dependencies.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of SSMs in Neural Networks\n\n- **Mamba-2** is highlighted as an efficient SSM that generalizes linear attention using structured state-space models. It maintains constant memory usage during inference, which is a significant advantage over traditional Transformers. However, it still faces challenges in tasks requiring precise memory recall, which is mitigated by the addition of SALs in Taipan.\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining Different Sequence Modeling Approaches\n\n- **Taipan** is a prime example of a hybrid architecture that integrates Mamba-2 with SALs. This combination allows for efficient processing of long sequences while capturing important long-range dependencies. The SALs identify tokens requiring long-range interactions, remove less important features, and augment their representations using attention, thus enhancing the overall performance.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Long Sequence Processing\n\n- **Taipan** and **Mamba-2** are designed to handle long sequences efficiently. Taipan uses a sparser attention weight map compared to full attention or standard windowed attention, which enhances computational efficiency. This allows Taipan to process sequences of up to 1 million tokens while maintaining efficiency.\n\n## Linear Complexity Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The **Mamba-2** model is based on a recurrent form that can be equivalently expressed as a matrix multiplication, which generalizes linear attention. This formulation keeps the computational complexity linear, making it more efficient than quadratic complexity of traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n## Implementation Details and Computational Complexity Analysis\n\n- **Taipan** introduces an attention budget constraint to balance efficiency and expressiveness. The model removes positional embeddings from the attention module to improve extrapolation capabilities and generalization of temporal relationships. The computational complexity is managed by using a sliding window attention mechanism, which allows for a longer sliding window to capture longer-range dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n- The use of **SSMs** like Mamba-2 ensures constant memory usage during inference, which is a significant improvement over Transformers. The hybrid architecture of **Taipan** further optimizes memory usage by using selective attention and sliding window attention, reducing the memory requirements for processing long sequences.\n\n## Training Stability Considerations\n\n- While the sources do not delve deeply into training stability, the integration of SSMs with attention mechanisms in **Taipan** suggests that careful balancing of the SSM and attention components is necessary. This involves managing the gradient flow through the combined architecture and initializing SSM parameters effectively to ensure stable training.\n\n## Performance Comparisons\n\n- **Taipan** demonstrates superior performance across various scales and tasks compared to other models. It outperforms in tasks requiring long-range dependencies and in-context retrieval, offering a promising solution for efficient long-context language modeling.\n\nIn summary, the **Taipan** architecture and the underlying **Mamba-2** model provide valuable insights into how to integrate SSMs with attention mechanisms efficiently, manage computational complexity, and ensure memory efficiency. These findings align well with the researcher's goals of improving autoregressive language model design by leveraging hybrid architectures and state-space models.\n",

SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.66)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality.

We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

These models are large-scale learning models that are initially pretrained on extensive datasets, and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. The term foundation models highlights these models' capability to learn and effectively generalize across a wide array of modalities, encompassing language, audio, images, video, genomics, and more. At their core, the predominant architecture for foundation models is the Transformer [1]. This architecture, based on the attention mechanism, allows to efficiently process information and model global dependencies in complex data; but it suffers from two main limitations. One is computational complexity: it requires the complete sequence to be fed into the model every time an output is generated, which results in poor scalability with the time horizon window ${ }^{1}$ and therefore poor performance in long context tasks [2]. The other limitation is explainability: despite its simple mathematical representation, it is currently not possible to interpret or understand the choice of outputs made by the Transformer [3]. Efforts to address the scalability challenges of Transformers have led to various architectural variants that still leverage the merits of the\n\n[^0]attention mechanism. Examples of such variants are the Longformer [4], BigBird [5], the Reformer [6], the Performer [7], and approaches leveraging Axial Attention [8]. However, despite extensive research on these fronts, the proposed solutions often degrade the inherent merits of the architecture or fail to perform well in practice [2]. A recent and promising research avenue proposes to fully replace the attention mechanism with a different representation based on State Space Models (SSM). The advantage of the SSM representation lies in its recurrent nature, where only the latest input has to be passed to the model since the state is able to capture information about past inputs. Moreover, due to their mathematical structure, they are amenable to computationally efficient training and inferencein contrast to their predecessors, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) [9]. This new family of SSM-based architectures has been shown to beat Transformers in long-context tasks such as the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark [2], and recent proposals such as Mamba [10] exhibit performance and computational efficiency superior to state-of-the-art Transformers on long-context tasks. These results highlight the potential of SSMs to overcome many of the current limitations of Transformers. Although SSMs show great promise to serve as foundation models, most of the existing literature on SSMs focuses on providing performant architectures and efficient implementations. Despite the clear connection with control theory, in particular linear systems theory, to date a principled understanding of these models is lacking, and most design choices are motivated from an empirical performance rather than a systematic system theoretical viewpoint. There is large potential in leveraging existing system theoretic results and analysis to complement current implementations and enhance explainability, design and performance. Towards this goal, the aim of this paper is to provide an overview of state-of-the-art SSMs from a control theoretical perspective. In Section $\\Pi$, we provide an overview of the essential components and considerations in SSMs. In Section III we review the most relevant SSM proposals to date. Since these models were primarily motivated by their ability to handle long contexts, we present the first performance comparison to date on the LRA benchmark in Section IV. Lastly, we end in Section V with concluding remarks and open research questions that could help advance SSMs and cross-pollinate the fields of foundation models and systems and control theory. ## II. State Space Models\n\nWe first present a generic language modelling task to define the learning goal of a foundation model. Then, we give an overview of the state space model architecture, mathematical structure, and computational considerations that guide the SSMs introduced in the literature. ## A. Learning setup\n\nA foundation model, such as those used in language modeling, can be seen as a map between input and output signals, i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=f(u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T) ; \\theta)\n$$\n\nwhere at each time $k$, the output $y(k)$ is produced after evaluating an input signal of length $k-T$, i.e., $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-$ $T)$, and a set of parameters $\\theta$. The parameters $\\theta$ are task dependent, and can be fine-tuned accordingly. Since the search space of general $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is too broad, different parameterizations of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can be used to render the problem tractable. For instance, the model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ can consist of multiple stacked models like e.g. the Transformer or more recently SSMs. The architectural choice of $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is a fundamental factor in determining the success of the model at effectively learning structure from data. The goal of a foundation model used as large language model is to learn a compressed representation of structure present in language in order to perform tasks like machine translation or human-level conversations (e.g. ChatGPT). To learn such a representation the parameterized model $f(\\cdot ; \\theta)$ is presented with input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k)) \\forall k$, where $\\theta$ represents the parameters. The parameters $\\theta$ are then iteratively updated to minimize a loss function $\\mathscr{L}(\\cdot)$, i.e., iteratively solving the following optimization problem\n\n$$\n\\min _{\\theta} \\mathscr{L}(y-f(u ; \\theta))\n$$\n\nFor a language model the inputs $u$ are tokenized ${ }^{2}$ sentences and the outputs $y$ are a shifted version of the same inputs, i.e., an auto-regressive setup. ## B. Parametrization\n\nLet us consider the following continuous-time linear system with dynamics\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\dot{x}(t)=A x(t)+B u(t) \\\\\n& y(t)=C x(t)+D u(t)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $x \\in \\mathbb{C}^{p}$ represents the complex-valued state, $u, y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{q}$ are the input and the output, respectively, and $t$ denotes the continuous-time index. We note that the input fed into the system denoted as $u$ is not a control input; it is seen as an exogenous input exciting the system (3). This choice of notation is made to maintain consistency with the corresponding literature. $A, B, C, D$ are complex-valued matrices of appropriate dimensions and in representation (3), these matrices\n\n[^1]are assumed to be time-invariant. When considering their time-varying version, a time sub-index would be appended, i.e., $A_{t}, B_{t}, C_{t}, D_{t}$. In the SSM literature, system (3) is used as a black-box representation in a foundation model. Here, the exogenous input $u(t)$ represents a signal or input token fed into the model at a given time $t$. The state $x(t)$ represents the hidden state that stores the relevant information about the current and previous inputs up to time $t$, and $y(t)$ is the output of the model at time $t$. In a learning setup, the matrices $A, B, C, D$ are parameters, which are commonly learned via stochastic gradient descent. Since computational efficiency and initialization are essential aspects in this framework, the dynamic matrix $A$ is often assumed to have a particular structure. As such, SSMs are often referred to as Structured SSMs. Assumption 2.1: The dynamic matrix in dynamics (3) has a diagonal structure, i.e., $A=\\operatorname{diag}\\left(\\lambda_{1}, \\ldots, \\lambda_{p}\\right)$ with $\\lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{C} \\forall i$. Although initial proposals [11], [12] deviate slightly from Assumption 2.1, most of the Structured SSMs literature assumes a diagonal $A$ matrix. Specific choices will be discussed in Section III\n\n## C. Discretization\n\nIn order to implement a SSM, a discrete-time version of system (3) is used. Hence, the implementation of system (3) in discrete-time is\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx(k+1) & =\\bar{A} x(k)+\\bar{B} u(k) \\\\\ny(k) & =\\bar{C} x(k)+\\bar{D} u(k)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{A}, \\bar{B}, \\bar{C}, \\bar{D}$ are the discrete-time dynamic matrices discretized with time-step $\\Delta \\in \\mathbb{R}$, possibly with complexvalued components, and $k$ denotes the discrete-time index. The choice of discretization scheme chosen varies widely among the proposed models in the SSM literature, and an overview is presented in Section III\nWe note that it is also possible to directly start from a discrete-time model as in equation (4), oblivious to its continuous-time representation (3). However, in most of the SSM literature, a continuous-time view of the dynamics is preferred in order to better motivate the choice of initialization for the dynamical matrices[13]. ## D. Structure and Initialization\n\nSince the dynamics (3) are being learned via gradient descent, initialization of the parameters was found to be of crucial importance. In particular, the initial values of matrix $A$ have a significant impact on the performance after training: on a simple classification task, performance increases from $67 \\%$ when $A$ is randomly initialized, to $80 \\%$ when $A$ is initialized using a principled strategy [12, Section 4.4]. Different strategies and parametrizations have been proposed in order to achieve a successful initialization, i.e. an initialization that results in the state $x(k)$ being able to capture the recent history of the inputs $u(k), \\ldots, u(k-T)$ for some time horizon $T$. This property is referred to as memory in the standard SSM literature. As is well-known in control\ntheory, the memory of system (4) is directly linked to the eigenvalues of matrix $A$. Lemma 2.2: (Informal) A dynamical system with dynamics (4) has long-range memory, i.e., captures information from past inputs, if the eigenvalues of $A$ are inside the unit circle and very close to the unit circumference, i.e. $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\leq 1$ and $|\\operatorname{eig}(A)| \\approx 1 \\forall \\operatorname{eig}(A)$. Hence, the various initialization schemes presented in the SSM literature aim to ensure that the modulo of the eigenvalues of the learned $A$ matrix is approximately equal to (but not bigger than) 1 . For the initialization of the other matrices, i.e., $B, C$, and $D$, standard initialization methods are used, e.g., Glorot [14] or LeCun [15], which essentially draw the initial values from a transformed uniform or normal distribution. Therefore, we omit the initialization details of $B, C$, and $D$ in the following and refer the reader to the original papers [14], [15]. ## E. Implementation\n\nOne of the major challenges addressed in the SSM literature is how to efficiently learn (training time) and deploy (inference time) the recurrence (4). At inference time, a causal representation is needed since the model does not have access to excitation inputs beyond the current time step. For this reason, the recurrent representation (4) is directly used starting with an initial excitation $u(1)$ and zero initial state $x(1)=0$. In order to speed up this process, parallel scans algorithms [16] are used that efficiently compute the recurrence by computing each output component in parallel and caching intermediate results. During training, it is possible (and desirable) to use a noncausal representation since input-output pairs $(u(k), y(k))$ are available for all $k$. Different techniques have been proposed in the literature. Some of the architectures can take advantage of parallel scan algorithms and use the recurrent representation from equation (4). Some other architectures rely on the convolutional representation of system (4), i.e.,\n\n$$\ny(k)=\\sum_{\\tau=0}^{k} \\bar{C} \\bar{A}^{k-\\tau} \\bar{B} u(\\tau)\n$$\n\nThis convolutional representation allows for faster learning because the complete input sequence $u(k) \\forall k$ can be passed through the model in one step. In terms of learning algorithms, SSM models are commonly trained using a standard stochastic gradient descent variation, i.e. Adam [17], and backpropagation [9]. Additionally, they can utilize the same heuristic methods to improve training as other deep-learning models, e.g., dropout or normalization [9]. ## F. Scaffolding and Layers\n\nAlthough learning the dynamics in equation (3) is a major focus of SSMs, these dynamics are not simply implemented in isolation. In fact, pre-processing of the input $u$ and postprocessing of the output $y$ is necessary to ensure good performance. In this paper, we refer to the algebraic operations of pre- and post-processing as the scaffolding surrounding\nA\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_0018655aa9d43ff9f8d3g-3.jpg?height=776&width=874&top_left_y=211&top_left_x=1078)\n\nFig. 1: A. General scaffolding of a SSM. The dynamical model (4) is represented in green. The input to the SSM is pre-processed and forked off in a skip connection (lower signal). The nature of the pre-processing map (linear or nonlinear) depends on the specific scaffolding. The output of the recursion is then post-processed with a nonlinear gate. B. Overall architecture of a SSM. Each of the SSMs including its scaffolding (Fig. 1.A.) is structured in a layered fashion, where the output from one layer is the input to the next. the SSM computation in dynamics (4). A general overview of the architecture used in SSMs is provided in Figure 1. A collection of different scaffolding choices have been proposed in the literature, ranging from standard multilayer perceptron (MLP) choices to gating operations, as defined in Definition 2.3. In general, a linear or nonlinear map is performed on the input $\\bar{u}$ before it is fed into system (4). Once the output $y$ has been computed, a gating operation is generally performed to control the flow of information from the input $\\tilde{u}$ to the output $\\tilde{y}$. Intuitively, the gate $g(\\tilde{y}, \\tilde{u})$ controls which outputs $\\tilde{y}$ are set to zero based on the inputs $\\tilde{u}$ via the softmax operation. Definition 2.3: Given two vectors $x_{1}, x_{2} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p}$, a gating operation is defined as $g\\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\\right):=x_{1} \\odot \\sigma\\left(W x_{2}\\right)$, where $W \\in \\mathbb{R}^{p \\times p}$, $\\odot$ is the element-wise multiplication, and $\\sigma$ is the softmax operation ${ }^{3}$\n\nAs is common practice in deep learning, several layers of SSMs (dynamics (3) and accompanying scaffolding) are stacked together, where each of them processes the output of the previous layer as its input, which is then fed into the next layer. This is possible since input $y$ and output $u$ are of the same dimension $\\mathbb{R}^{q}$. For example on smaller tasks like e.g. the LRA benchmark [2], a SSM is composed of 6 structurally-identical layers (with different dynamic matri-\n\n[^2]ces), and the size of the systems ranges in $p \\in[64,512], q \\in$ [32, 1024]. For language modelling the number of layers and system size can be significantly larger.\n```\n\n#### 4. Understanding the differences in Foundation Models: Attention, State Space Models, and Recurrent Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.54)\n\n*Jerome Sieber, Carmen Amo Alonso, A. Didier, M.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/29 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\nHere we discuss the most prominent one. S6. The first selective SSM parametrization (S6) was introduced together with the Mamba architecture Gu and Dao, 2023]. The S6 block parametrizes the recurrence as\n\n$$\nA_{i}=e^{-\\Delta_{i} A}, \\quad B_{i}=\\Delta_{i} W_{B} u_{i}, \\quad C_{i}=W_{C} u_{i}, \\quad D_{i}=W_{D} u_{i}\n$$\n\nwith $\\Delta_{i}=\\operatorname{softplus}\\left(W_{\\Delta}\\left(W_{u} u_{i}\\right)+b_{\\Delta}\\right)$ for every $i, W_{\\Delta}, W_{u}, W_{B}, W_{C}, W_{D}, A$ are learnt matrices of appropriate dimensions, and $b_{\\Delta}$ is a learnt bias. While SSM models allow for complex-valued matrices $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$, here we restrict ourselves to real-valued matrices as in Gu and Dao, 2023]. ### 2.3 Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nSimilar to SSMs, RNNs also parameterize the input-output relationship via a recurrent computation, commonly given by the long short-term memory (LSTM) [Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997], at each time step $i$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nx_{i} & =f_{i} \\odot x_{i-1}+i_{i} \\odot \\bar{u}_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =o_{i} \\odot \\tanh \\left(x_{i}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\bar{u}_{i}$ represents the pre-processed raw input $u_{i}$, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{i}=\\tanh \\left(W_{u} u_{i}+U_{u} y_{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nand $f_{i}, i_{i}$, and $o_{i}$ are the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate, respectively,\n\n$$\nf_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{f} u_{i}+U_{f} y_{i-1}\\right), \\quad i_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{i} u_{i}+U_{i} y_{i-1}\\right), \\quad o_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{o} u_{i}+U_{o} y_{i-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $W_{f}, W_{i}, W_{o}$ and $U_{f}, U_{i}, U_{o}$ are the learnt gate parameters. In this paper, we focus on two variants: quasi LSTMs (qLSTM) [Stani\u0107 et al. 2023], which removes the output dependence of the gates, and RG-LRU [De et al. 2024], which attempts to integrate ideas from SSMs into RNNs. qLSTM. The qLSTM model is parameterized by recurrence (5) with pre-processed input $\\bar{u}_{i}$ and gates $f_{i}, i_{i}, o_{i}$ :\n\n$$\n\\bar{u}_{i}=\\tanh \\left(W_{u} u_{i}\\right), \\quad f_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{f} u_{i}\\right), \\quad i_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{i} u_{i}\\right), \\quad o_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{o} u_{i}\\right)\n$$\n\nRG-LRU. The RG-LRU model presents a hybrid between a qLSTM and a SSM. The recurrence is given as\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& x_{i}=a_{i} \\odot x_{i-1}+\\sqrt{1-a_{i}^{2}} \\odot\\left(i_{i} \\odot u_{i}\\right) \\\\\n& y_{i}=x_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith the following gates and no pre-processing of $u_{i}$ :\n\n$$\nr_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{a} u_{i}\\right), \\quad i_{i}=\\sigma\\left(W_{u} u_{i}\\right), \\quad a_{i}=e^{-c r_{i} \\odot \\operatorname{softplus}(\\Lambda)}\n$$\n\n## 3 Dynamical Systems Framework for Architecture Comparison\n\nIn this section, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF) that allows in-depth analysis of the architectural features of attention, SSMs, and RNNs from a dynamical systems perspective. We use this to rewrite the parametrizations in a common framework and provide detailed comparisons. ### 3.1 Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF)\n\nThe DSF relies on a dynamical systems representation of the architectures. As is standard in RNN and SSM literature, we choose a recurrent state space representation. In particular, a linear structured time-varying (LTV) dynamical system is defined by the recurrence\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_{i} & =\\Lambda_{i} h_{i-1}+B_{i} u_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =C_{i} h_{i}+D_{i} u_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N}$ is the hidden state initialized with $h_{-1}=0, \\Lambda_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is the diagonal state transition matrix, $B_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d}$ and $C_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times N}$ are the input and output matrices, respectively, and $D_{i} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d \\times d}$ is a scaled skip connection. Dynamical system (11) can alternatively be written in its convolutional representation, i.e., $\\mathbf{y}=\\boldsymbol{\\Phi u}$, where the convolutional kernel $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}$ is defined as\n\n$$\n\\boldsymbol{\\Phi}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nC_{0} B_{0}+D_{0} & & & \\\\\nC_{1} \\Lambda_{1} B_{0} & C_{1} B_{1}+D_{1} & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\nC_{L} \\prod_{k=1}^{L} \\Lambda_{k} B_{0} & \\ldots & C_{L} \\Lambda_{L} B_{L-1} & C_{L} B_{L}+D_{L}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nNote that the convolution kernel $\\boldsymbol{\\Phi} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times L}$ is of the same dimension as the attention matrix $\\zeta\\left(\\mathbf{q} \\mathbf{k}^{\\top}\\right)$ and that these matrices are equivalent, up to the scaling factor $W_{V}$ used in self-attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Compared to previously-dominant recurrent architectures [RNNs 17, 29], transformers offered a key advantage: parallelized training by avoiding recurrence. However, building on a long history of continuous dynamical models [e.g. 34, 35] and early work on faster RNNs [8, 41], a recent line of work has developed state space models (SSMs) rivaling the performance of transformers [e.g. 24, 23, 67, 14, 72, 56]. These SSMs are recurrent models that-while formulated in terms of iterative state updates-allow efficient parallelization. The impressive empirical performance of such SSMs raises the question of whether they might have capabilities that the transformer architecture might lack in principle. Simultaneously, to understand whether SSMs may plausibly overtake the dominant role of transformers, it is an important question whether SSMs may lack abilities present in transformers. A better understanding of these questions may also point the way to future architectures that unite the strengths of both architectures. One common approach to understanding the capabilities of computational architectures is through their expressive capacity in simulating automata and modeling language classes; indeed, a sizeable literature has studied transformers [e.g. 54, 25, 6, 73, 44, 45, 15, 66, 10, 59, 53] and RNNs [e.g. 62, 31, 32, 70, 28] through this lens. As the difficulty of many computational problems is wellunderstood in terms of such language classes, results about expressive capacity directly yield results about the ability to model specific computational problems. While a substantial number of results have been obtained for transformers and traditional RNNs, understanding remains largely open for SSMs. In an initial step, Merrill et al. [49] showed that all problems computable by SSMs are contained in $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$, a circuit complexity class that is known to\nalso cover transformers [48,65]. Under standard conjectures, this suggests that certain types of state tracking are hard for both models. Jelassi et al. [33] provided evidence for differences between the architectures, showing that transformers are better than SSMs at the specific problem of copying strings - a problem well within $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. However, beyond these results, broader detailed understanding of the power of SSMs and how they compare to RNNs and transformers remains open. Our contribution in this paper is to provide rigorous understanding of SSMs' abilities in different classes of languages. We show that transformers and SSMs cover overlapping but distinct fragments of $\\mathrm{TC}^{0}$. For instance, SSMs can model bounded hierarchical structure in ways similar to transformers and traditional RNNs, even without embedding a stack-like structure (Theorem 6). For regular languages involving modular counting, such as the PARITY function (Theorem 2), we identify a design choice that makes extant SSMs struggle in ways similar to transformers. In other cases, we show that SSMs resolve a failure case of transformers: they effortlessly model Flip Flop state tracking (Theorem 1). We discuss take-aways for SSM and LLM research in Section 5; among others, our results suggest future LM architectures might need to combine both attention and state spaces. ## 2 Background: State Space Models\n\nSSM Layers We define a single layer of a state space model as a map, at input length $T$,\n\n$$\n\\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times d} \\quad\\left(x_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T} \\mapsto\\left(z_{t}\\right)_{t=1, \\ldots, T}\n$$\n\ngiven by the recurrence\n\n$$\nh_{t}=A\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\circ h_{t-1}+B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\quad z_{t}=\\phi\\left(h_{t}, x_{t}\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\circ$ denotes elementwise product, and, for each $x_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{cl}\nh_{0} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} & B\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (increment) } \\\\\nA\\left(x_{t}\\right) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d}(\\text { gate }) & \\phi: \\mathbb{R}^{2 d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\text { (transform) }\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nWe allow $A, B$ to be arbitrary smooth maps.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 15 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"training optimization hybrid SSM attention\", \"memory efficient state space models\", \"SSM attention performance comparison\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 7 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn? A Comparative Study on In-Context Learning Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: \"training optimization hybrid SSM attention\"*\n\n*Jongho Park, Jaeseung Park, Zheyang Xiong, Nayoung Lee, Jaewoong Cho, Samet Oymak, Kangwook Lee, Dimitris Papailiopoulos*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hybrid model is introduced, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently, and suggests that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs), such as Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023), have been proposed as alternatives to Transformer networks in language modeling, by incorporating gating, convolutions, and input-dependent token selection to mitigate the quadratic cost of multi-head attention. Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 43  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. State-space Models with Layer-wise Nonlinearity are Universal Approximators with Exponential Decaying Memory\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Shida Wang, Beichen Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models have gained popularity in sequence modelling due to their simple and efficient network structures. However, the absence of nonlinear activation along the temporal direction limits the model's capacity. In this paper, we prove that stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation is sufficient to approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Our findings demonstrate that the addition of layer-wise nonlinear activation enhances the model's capacity to learn complex sequence patterns. Meanwhile, it can be seen both theoretically and empirically that the state-space models do not fundamentally resolve the issue of exponential decaying memory.

Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

We achieve this using properties of the proposed frequency domain transfer function parametrization, which enables direct computation of its corresponding convolutional kernel's spectrum via a single Fast Fourier Transform. Our experimental results across multiple sequence lengths and state sizes illustrates, on average, a 35% training speed improvement over S4 layers -- parametrized in time-domain -- on the Long Range Arena benchmark, while delivering state-of-the-art downstream performances over other attention-free approaches. Moreover, we report improved perplexity in language modeling over a long convolutional Hyena baseline, by simply introducing our transfer function parametrization.

Efficient Transformer Knowledge Distillation: A Performance Review\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention performance comparison\"*\n\n*Nathan Brown, Ashton Williamson, Tahj Anderson, Logan Lawrence*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, and performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Abstract:** As pretrained transformer language models continue to achieve state-of-the-art performance, the Natural Language Processing community has pushed for advances in model compression and efficient attention mechanisms to address high computational requirements and limited input sequence length. Despite these separate efforts, no investigation has been done into the intersection of these two fields. In this work, we provide an evaluation of model compression via knowledge distillation on efficient attention transformers. We provide cost-performance trade-offs for the compression of state-of-the-art efficient attention architectures and the gains made in performance in comparison to their full attention counterparts. Furthermore, we introduce a new long-context Named Entity Recognition dataset, GONERD, to train and test the performance of NER models on long sequences. We find that distilled efficient attention transformers can preserve a significant amount of original model performance, preserving up to 98.6% across short-context tasks (GLUE, SQUAD, CoNLL-2003), up to 94.6% across long-context Question-and-Answering tasks (HotpotQA, TriviaQA), and up to 98.8% on long-context Named Entity Recognition (GONERD), while decreasing inference times by up to 57.8%. We find that, for most models on most tasks, performing knowledge distillation is an effective method to yield high-performing efficient attention models with low costs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Self-Attention Graph Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention performance comparison\"*\n\n*Junhyun Lee, Inyeop Lee, Jaewoo Kang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a graph pooling method based on self-attention using graph convolution, which achieves superior graph classification performance on the benchmark datasets using a reasonable number of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Advanced methods of applying deep learning to structured data such as graphs have been proposed in recent years. In particular, studies have focused on generalizing convolutional neural networks to graph data, which includes redefining the convolution and the downsampling (pooling) operations for graphs. The method of generalizing the convolution operation to graphs has been proven to improve performance and is widely used. However, the method of applying downsampling to graphs is still difficult to perform and has room for improvement. In this paper, we propose a graph pooling method based on self-attention. Self-attention using graph convolution allows our pooling method to consider both node features and graph topology. To ensure a fair comparison, the same training procedures and model architectures were used for the existing pooling methods and our method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior graph classification performance on the benchmark datasets using a reasonable number of parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1003  (*Influential: 151*)\n\n#### 7. Never Train from Scratch: Fair Comparison of Long-Sequence Models Requires Data-Driven Priors\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention performance comparison\"*\n\n*Ido Amos, Jonathan Berant, Ankit Gupta*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work finds vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and improves the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points.\n\n**Abstract:** Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using $\\textit{only the downstream task data}$, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"training optimization hybrid SSM attention\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuohang Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, ChengXiang Zhai*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent hybrid models combining Linear State Space Models (SSMs) with\nself-attention mechanisms have demonstrated impressive results across a range\nof sequence modeling tasks. However, current approaches apply attention modules\nstatically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to\nsub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. To address this limitation, we\nintroduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural\nnetworks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements\nin a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated\nsub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption of neural networks\nat both training and inference stages. To validate the effectiveness of SMA on\nsequence modeling, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which\nemploys SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the\nstate representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only\nconduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear\ninference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide\nsubstantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based\nmodels. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including long sequence\nmodeling, speech classification and language modeling, SeqBoat brings new\nstate-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity, and\nreveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse\nactivation patterns.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"training optimization hybrid SSM attention\"*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, Khaled K. Saab, Armin W. Thomas, Atri Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence\nmodeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language\nmodeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead\nof quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware\nutilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity\ngap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the\nhardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language\nmodeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that\nexisting SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the\nsequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on\nlanguage modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed\nfor these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes\nwithin 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid\n125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers\nsurprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to\nimprove the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose\nFlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on\nsequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that\nexploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences.\nFlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows\nhybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers.\nUsing FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B\nparameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower\nperplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and\nfew-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28T17:56:03Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-29T03:18:40Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. MambaByte: Token-free Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Tushaar Gangavarapu, Jing Nathan Yan, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Token-free language models learn directly from raw bytes and remove the\ninductive bias of subword tokenization. Operating on bytes, however, results in\nsignificantly longer sequences. In this setting, standard autoregressive\nTransformers scale poorly as the effective memory required grows with sequence\nlength. The recent development of the Mamba state space model (SSM) offers an\nappealing alternative approach with a fixed-sized memory state and efficient\ndecoding. We propose MambaByte, a token-free adaptation of the Mamba SSM\ntrained autoregressively on byte sequences. In terms of modeling, we show\nMambaByte to be competitive with, and even to outperform, state-of-the-art\nsubword Transformers on language modeling tasks while maintaining the benefits\nof token-free language models, such as robustness to noise. In terms of\nefficiency, we develop an adaptation of speculative decoding with tokenized\ndrafting and byte-level verification. This results in a $2.6\\times$ inference\nspeedup to the standard MambaByte implementation, showing similar decoding\nefficiency as the subword Mamba. These findings establish the viability of SSMs\nin enabling token-free language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-24T18:53:53Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-09T20:18:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context\n  Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Yadong Lu, Yelong Shen, Chen Liang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a\nlong-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation\ncomplexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In\nthis work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise\ncombines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window\nAttention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent\nhidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories\nwith the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T\ntraining tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of\nbenchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently\nextrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show\nimproved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence\nmodel, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with\ngrouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x\nspeedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming.

We study three different, and completely\nparallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show\nthat our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language\nmodeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences.

MoViNets: Mobile Video Networks for Efficient Video Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Boqing Gong, Matthew Brown, Mingxing Tan, Li Zhang, Yandong Li, Liangzhe Yuan, Dan Kondratyuk*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Mobile Video Networks (MoViNets), a family of computation and memory efficient video networks that can operate on streaming video for online inference. 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are accurate at video recognition but require large computation and memory budgets and do not support online inference, making them difficult to work on mobile devices. We propose a three-step approach to improve computational efficiency while substantially reducing the peak memory usage of 3D CNNs. First, we design a video network search space and employ neural architecture search to generate efficient and diverse 3D CNN architectures. Second, we introduce the Stream Buffer technique that decouples memory from video clip duration, allowing 3D CNNs to embed arbitrary-length streaming video sequences for both training and inference with a small constant memory footprint. Third, we propose a simple ensembling technique to improve accuracy further without sacrificing efficiency. These three progressive techniques allow MoViNets to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and efficiency on the Kinetics, Moments in Time, and Charades video action recognition datasets. For instance, MoViNet-A5-Stream achieves the same accuracy as X3D-XL on Kinetics 600 while requiring 80% fewer FLOPs and 65% less memory.

Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: \"memory efficient state space models\"*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3.

This approach allows for the integration of pre-trained models, reducing the need for extensive pre-training from scratch.\n- **Learning Rate Schedules**: The Falcon Mamba model uses a warmup-stable-decay (WSD) learning rate schedule, which includes a high learning rate during the stable stage and a gradual decay. This schedule helps in quick adaptation to data distribution shifts and improves overall performance.\n- **Data Mixture and Curriculum Learning**: The training process for Falcon Mamba involves a curriculum learning approach with progressively increasing sequence lengths and carefully selected data mixtures. This helps in refining the model's knowledge and improving its performance on diverse tasks.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations and Optimizations\n\n- **Hybrid Architecture Design**: Models like Zamba and E-Tamba utilize a hybrid architecture that interleaves Mamba layers with attention layers. This design minimizes parameter costs and reduces memory usage significantly. For example, E-Tamba-1.1B achieves nearly 3X memory savings compared to pure Transformer models.\n- **Shared Attention Layers**: The Zamba architecture uses shared attention layers to optimize memory efficiency. This approach allows the model to maintain performance while reducing the overall parameter count.\n- **Quantization Techniques**: Research on quantization methods, such as those discussed in the OpenVINO blog, can be applied to hybrid models to further reduce memory usage. Techniques like mixed-precision quantization and adaptive post-training quantization can help in achieving efficient memory usage without significant performance degradation.\n\n## Performance Comparisons\n\n- **Hybrid vs Pure Models**: Hybrid models like Zamba and E-Tamba have shown competitive performance with pure Transformer models, especially in terms of memory efficiency and long-context processing. Zamba2-1.2B, for instance, achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with less than 2 billion parameters and is competitive with larger models.\n- **Long-Context Tasks**: Hybrid models excel in long-context tasks such as long-context copying and phone book retrieval. E-Tamba-1.1B demonstrates exceptional performance in these tasks, leveraging the strengths of both Transformers and Mamba models.\n\n## Parameter Sharing and Integration Strategies\n\n- **LoRA Projectors**: The Zamba2 architecture uses LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) projectors to allow shared transformer blocks to specialize slightly at each invocation. This approach adds depth-specialization with minimal increase in parameter count.\n- **Layer-Wise Importance Analysis**: E-Tamba uses layer-wise importance analysis to determine which layers to replace with Mamba layers, ensuring that critical layers are preserved while non-critical layers are optimized for memory efficiency.\n\n## Gradient Flow and Initialization Techniques\n\n- **Warmup-Stable-Decay Learning Rate Schedule**: As mentioned earlier, this schedule helps in stabilizing the training process and improving gradient flow. It allows for a high learning rate during the stable stage, facilitating quick adaptation to data distribution shifts.\n- **Mimetic Initialization**: Although not directly mentioned in the provided sources, mimetic initialization techniques can be beneficial for state-space models. These techniques help in initializing the model parameters in a way that facilitates better recall and stability during training.\n\n### Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combining SSMs with attention mechanisms can leverage the strengths of both, improving performance in long-context tasks and memory efficiency.\n- **Training Techniques**: Using layer transplantation, fine-tuning, and specific learning rate schedules can enhance training stability and efficiency.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Shared attention layers, quantization techniques, and careful parameter sharing are crucial for memory-efficient implementations.\n- **Performance**: Hybrid models can achieve competitive performance with pure models, especially in tasks requiring long-context processing.\n- **Integration Strategies**: Techniques like LoRA projectors and layer-wise importance analysis are essential for integrating SSM and attention components effectively.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and high-performing autoregressive language models that integrate the benefits of both SSMs and attention mechanisms.\n",

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/86 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nBeyond its intrinsic theoretical value, our framework opens up a broad set of directions for understanding and improving sequence models. Efficient Algorithms. First and most importantly, our framework exposes new efficient and easily-implementable algorithms for computing SSMs (Section 6). We introduce a new SSD algorithm, based on block decompositions of semiseparable matrices, that takes advantage of both the linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual form, obtaining optimal tradeoffs on all main efficiency axes (e.g. training and inference compute, memory usage, and ability to leverage matrix multiplication units on modern hardware). A dedicated implementation of SSD is $2-8 \\times$ faster than the optimized selective scan implementation of Mamba, while simultaneously allowing for much larger recurrent state sizes ( $8 \\times$ the size of Mamba or even higher, with minimal slowdown). SSD is highly competitive with optimized implementations of softmax attention (FlashAttention-2 (Dao 2024)), crossing over at sequence length 2 K and $6 \\times$ faster at sequence length 16 K . Architecture Design. One major obstacle to adopting new architectures such as SSMs is the ecosystem tailored to Transformers, such as hardware-efficient optimization and parallelism techniques for large-scale training. Our framework allows using established conventions and techniques for attention to build a vocabulary of architecture design choices for SSMs, and further improve them (Section 7). For example, we introduce the analog of heads from multi-head attention (MHA) to SSMs. We show that the Mamba architecture is a multi-input SSM (MIS) that turns out to be analogous to multi-value attention (MVA), and compare other variants of Mamba with different head structures. We also use these ideas to make slight modifications to the Mamba block, which allows tensor parallelism to be implemented (e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.28)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/74 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nHowever, their effectiveness is limited by how well this state has compressed the context. To understand this principle, we focus on two running examples of synthetic tasks (Figure 2). - The Selective Copying task modifies the popular Copying task (Arjovsky, Shah, and Bengio 2016) by varying the position of the tokens to memorize. It requires content-aware reasoning to be able to memorize the relevant tokens (colored) and filter out the irrelevant ones (white). - The Induction Heads task is a well-known mechanism hypothesized to explain the majority of in-context learning abilities of LLMs (Olsson et al. 2022). It requires context-aware reasoning to know when to produce the correct output in the appropriate context (black). These tasks reveal the failure mode of LTI models. From the recurrent view, their constant dynamics (e.g. the $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ transitions in (2)) cannot let them select the correct information from their context, or affect the hidden state passed along the sequence in an input-dependent way. From the convolutional view, it is known that global convolutions can solve the vanilla Copying task (Romero et al. 2021) because it only requires time-awareness, but that they have difficulty with the Selective Copying task because of lack of content-awareness (Figure 2). More concretely, the spacing between inputs-to-outputs is varying and cannot be modeled by static convolution kernels. In summary, the efficiency vs. effectiveness tradeoff of sequence models is characterized by how well they compress their state: efficient models must have a small state, while effective models must have a state that contains all necessary information from the context. In turn, we propose that a fundamental principle for building sequence models is selectivity: or the context-aware ability to focus on or filter out inputs into a sequential state. In particular, a selection mechanism controls how information propagates or interacts along the sequence dimension (see Section 3.5 for more discussion). ### 3.2 Improving SSMs with Selection\n\nOne method of incorporating a selection mechanism into models is by letting their parameters that affect interactions along the sequence (e.g. the recurrent dynamics of an RNN or the convolution kernel of a CNN ) be input-dependent. Algorithms 1 and 2 illustrates the main selection mechanism that we use. The main difference is simply making several parameters $\\Delta, B, C$ functions of the input, along with the associated changes to tensor shapes throughout. In particular, we highlight that these parameters now have a length dimension $L$, meaning that the model has changed from time-invariant to time-varying. (Note that shape annotations were described in Section 2.) This loses the equivalence to convolutions (3) with implications for its efficiency, discussed next. We specifically choose $s_{B}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{C}(x)=\\operatorname{Linear}_{N}(x), s_{\\Delta}(x)=\\operatorname{Broadcast}_{D}\\left(\\operatorname{Linear}_{1}(x)\\right)$, and $\\tau_{\\Delta}=$ softplus, where Linear $_{d}$ is a parameterized projection to dimension $d$. The choice of $s_{\\Delta}$ and $\\tau_{\\Delta}$ is due to a connection to RNN gating mechanisms explained in Section 3.5. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_9db7b10d0e19303048adg-06.jpg?height=421&width=1722&top_left_y=256&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 2: (Left) The standard version of the Copying task involves constant spacing between input and output elements and is easily solved by time-invariant models such as linear recurrences and global convolutions. (Right Top) The Selective Copying task has random spacing in between inputs and requires time-varying models that can selectively remember or ignore inputs depending on their content.

Here we aim to make selective SSMs efficient on modern hardware (GPUs) as well. The selection mechanism is quite natural, and earlier works attempted to incorporate special cases of selection, such as letting $\\Delta$ vary over time in recurrent $\\operatorname{SSMs}$ (Gu, Dao, et al. 2020). However, as previously mentioned a core limitation in the usage of SSMs is their computational efficiency, which was why S4 and all derivatives used LTI (non-selective) models, most commonly in the form of global convolutions. ### 3.3.1 Motivation of Prior Models\n\nWe first revisit this motivation and overview our approach to overcome limitations of prior methods. - At a high level, recurrent models such as SSMs always balance a tradeoff between expressivity and speed: as discussed in Section 3.1, models with larger hidden state dimension should be more effective but slower. Thus we want to maximize hidden state dimension without paying speed and memory costs. - Note that the recurrent mode is more flexible than the convolution mode, since the latter (3) is derived from expanding the former (2) $(\\mathrm{Gu}$, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022; Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). However, this would require computing and materializing the latent state $h$ with shape (B,L,D,N), which is much larger (by a factor of $N$, the SSM state dimension) than the input $x$ and output $y$ of shape ( $B, L, D)$. Thus the more efficient convolution mode was introduced which could bypass the state computation and materializes a convolution kernel (3a) of size only (B, L, D). - Prior LTI state space models leverage the dual recurrent-convolutional forms to increase the effective state dimension by a factor of $N(\\approx 10-100)$, much larger than traditional RNNs, without efficiency penalties. ### 3.3.2 Overview of Selective Scan: Hardware-Aware State Expansion\n\nThe selection mechanism is designed to overcome the limitations of LTI models; at the same time, we therefore need to revisit the computation problem of SSMs. We address this with three classical techniques: kernel fusion, parallel scan, and recomputation. We make two main observations:\n\n- The naive recurrent computation uses $O(B L D N)$ FLOPs while the convolutional computation uses $O(B L D \\log (L))$ FLOPs, and the former has a lower constant factor. Thus for long sequences and not-too-large state dimension $N$, the recurrent mode can actually use fewer FLOPs. - The two challenges are the sequential nature of recurrence, and the large memory usage. To address the latter, just like the convolutional mode, we can attempt to not actually materialize the full state $h$. The main idea is to leverage properties of modern accelerators (GPUs) to materialize the state $h$ only in more efficient levels of the memory hierarchy. In particular, most operations (except matrix multiplication) are bounded by memory bandwidth (Dao, Fu, Ermon, et al. 2022; Ivanov et al. 2021; Williams, Waterman, and Patterson 2009). This includes our scan operation, and we use kernel fusion to reduce the amount of memory IOs, leading to a significant speedup compared to a standard implementation. Concretely, instead of preparing the scan input $(\\bar{A}, \\bar{B})$ of size (B, L, D, N) in GPU HBM (high-bandwidth memory), we load the SSM parameters ( $\\triangle, A, B, C)$ directly from slow HBM to fast SRAM, perform the discretization and recurrence in SRAM, and then write the final outputs of size (B, L, D) back to HBM. To avoid the sequential recurrence, we observe that despite not being linear it can still be parallelized with a work-efficient parallel scan algorithm (Blelloch 1990; Martin and Cundy 2018; Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023). Finally, we must also avoid saving the intermediate states, which are necessary for backpropagation. We carefully apply the classic technique of recomputation to reduce the memory requirements: the intermediate states are not stored but recomputed in the backward pass when the inputs are loaded from HBM to SRAM. As a result, the fused selective scan layer has the same memory requirements as an optimized transformer implementation with FlashAttention. Details of the fused kernel and recomputation are in Appendix D. The full Selective SSM layer and algorithm is illustrated in Figure 1. ### 3.4 A Simplified SSM Architecture\n\nAs with structured SSMs, selective SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be flexibly incorporated into neural networks. The H3 architecture is the basis for the most well-known SSM architectures (Section 2), which are generally comprised of a block inspired by linear attention interleaved with an MLP (multi-layer perceptron) block. We simplify this architecture by combining these two components into one, which is stacked homogenously (Figure 3). This is inspired by the gated attention unit (GAU) (Hua et al. 2022), which did something similar for attention. This architecture involves expanding the model dimension $D$ by a controllable expansion factor $E$. For each block, most of the parameters $\\left(3 E D^{2}\\right)$ are in the linear projections ( $2 E D^{2}$ for input projections, $E D^{2}$ for output projection) while the inner SSM contributes less. The number of SSM parameters (projections for $\\Delta, B, C$, and the matrix $A$ ) are much smaller in comparison. We repeat this block, interleaved with standard normalization and residual connections, to form the Mamba architecture. We always fix to $E=2$ in our experiments and use two stacks of the block to match the $12 D^{2}$ parameters of a Transformer's interleaved MHA (multi-head attention) and MLP blocks.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"hybrid model optimization techniques\", \"SSM attention stability analysis\", \"hardware efficient implementation\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. NASViT: Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Vision Transformers with Gradient Conflict aware Supernet Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid model optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Chengyue Gong, Dilin Wang, Meng Li, Xinlei Chen, Zhicheng Yan, Yuandong Tian, Qiang Liu, Vikas Chandra*\n\n**TL;DR:** A discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.\n\n**Abstract:** Designing accurate and ef\ufb01cient vision transformers (ViTs) is an important but challenging task. Supernet-based one-shot neural architecture search (NAS) enables fast architecture optimization and has achieved state-of-the-art results on convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, directly applying the supernet-based NAS to optimize ViTs leads to poor performance - even worse compared to training single ViTs. In this work, we observe that the poor performance is due to a gradient con\ufb02ict issue: the gradients of different sub-networks con\ufb02ict with that of the supernet more severely in ViTs than CNNs, which leads to early saturation in training and inferior convergence. To alleviate this issue, we propose a series of techniques, including a gradient projection algorithm, a switchable layer scaling design, and a simpli\ufb01ed data augmentation and regularization training recipe. The proposed techniques signi\ufb01cantly improve the convergence and the performance of all sub-networks. Our discovered hybrid ViT model family, dubbed NASViT, achieves top-1 accuracy from 78.2% to 81.8% on ImageNet from 200M to 800M FLOPs, and outperforms all the prior art CNNs and ViTs, including AlphaNet and LeViT.

Design-Bench: Benchmarks for Data-Driven Offline Model-Based Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid model optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Brandon Trabucco, Xinyang Geng, Aviral Kumar, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents Design-Bench, a benchmark for offline MBO with a unified evaluation protocol and reference implementations of recent methods, which includes a suite of diverse and realistic tasks derived from real-world optimization problems in biology, materials science, and robotics that present distinct challenges forOffline MBO.\n\n**Abstract:** Black-box model-based optimization (MBO) problems, where the goal is to find a design input that maximizes an unknown objective function, are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, such as the design of proteins, DNA sequences, aircraft, and robots. Solving model-based optimization problems typically requires actively querying the unknown objective function on design proposals, which means physically building the candidate molecule, aircraft, or robot, testing it, and storing the result. This process can be expensive and time consuming, and one might instead prefer to optimize for the best design using only the data one already has. This setting -- called offline MBO -- poses substantial and different algorithmic challenges than more commonly studied online techniques. A number of recent works have demonstrated success with offline MBO for high-dimensional optimization problems using high-capacity deep neural networks. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this emerging field is making progress difficult to track. To address this, we present Design-Bench, a benchmark for offline MBO with a unified evaluation protocol and reference implementations of recent methods. Our benchmark includes a suite of diverse and realistic tasks derived from real-world optimization problems in biology, materials science, and robotics that present distinct challenges for offline MBO.

DeepZero: Scaling up Zeroth-Order Optimization for Deep Model Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid model optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Aochuan Chen, Yimeng Zhang, Jinghan Jia, James Diffenderfer, Jiancheng Liu, Konstantinos Parasyris, Yihua Zhang, Zheng Zhang, B. Kailkhura, Sijia Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** DeepZero is developed, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations, and a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE.\n\n**Abstract:** Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has become a popular technique for solving machine learning (ML) problems when first-order (FO) information is difficult or impossible to obtain. However, the scalability of ZO optimization remains an open problem: Its use has primarily been limited to relatively small-scale ML problems, such as sample-wise adversarial attack generation. To our best knowledge, no prior work has demonstrated the effectiveness of ZO optimization in training deep neural networks (DNNs) without a significant decrease in performance. To overcome this roadblock, we develop DeepZero, a principled ZO deep learning (DL) framework that can scale ZO optimization to DNN training from scratch through three primary innovations. First, we demonstrate the advantages of coordinate-wise gradient estimation (CGE) over randomized vector-wise gradient estimation in training accuracy and computational efficiency. Second, we propose a sparsity-induced ZO training protocol that extends the model pruning methodology using only finite differences to explore and exploit the sparse DL prior in CGE. Third, we develop the methods of feature reuse and forward parallelization to advance the practical implementations of ZO training. Our extensive experiments show that DeepZero achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy on ResNet-20 trained on CIFAR-10, approaching FO training performance for the first time. Furthermore, we show the practical utility of DeepZero in applications of certified adversarial defense and DL-based partial differential equation error correction, achieving 10-20% improvement over SOTA. We believe our results will inspire future research on scalable ZO optimization and contribute to advancing DL with black box.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention stability analysis\"*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5.

However, existing theoretical studies on how this phenomenon arises are limited to the dynamics of a single layer of attention trained on linear regression tasks. In this paper, we study the optimization of a Transformer consisting of a fully connected layer followed by a linear attention layer. The MLP acts as a common nonlinear representation or feature map, greatly enhancing the power of in-context learning. We prove in the mean-field and two-timescale limit that the infinite-dimensional loss landscape for the distribution of parameters, while highly nonconvex, becomes quite benign. We also analyze the second-order stability of mean-field dynamics and show that Wasserstein gradient flow almost always avoids saddle points. Furthermore, we establish novel methods for obtaining concrete improvement rates both away from and near critical points. This represents the first saddle point analysis of mean-field dynamics in general and the techniques are of independent interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Synergizing Unsupervised and Supervised Learning: A Hybrid Approach for\n  Accurate Natural Language Task Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hybrid model optimization techniques\"*\n\n*Wrick Talukdar, Anjanava Biswas*\n\n**Abstract:** While supervised learning models have shown remarkable performance in various\nnatural language processing (NLP) tasks, their success heavily relies on the\navailability of large-scale labeled datasets, which can be costly and\ntime-consuming to obtain. Conversely, unsupervised learning techniques can\nleverage abundant unlabeled text data to learn rich representations, but they\ndo not directly optimize for specific NLP tasks. This paper presents a novel\nhybrid approach that synergizes unsupervised and supervised learning to improve\nthe accuracy of NLP task modeling. While supervised models excel at specific\ntasks, they rely on large labeled datasets. Unsupervised techniques can learn\nrich representations from abundant unlabeled text but don't directly optimize\nfor tasks. Our methodology integrates an unsupervised module that learns\nrepresentations from unlabeled corpora (e.g., language models, word embeddings)\nand a supervised module that leverages these representations to enhance\ntask-specific models. We evaluate our approach on text classification and named\nentity recognition (NER), demonstrating consistent performance gains over\nsupervised baselines. For text classification, contextual word embeddings from\na language model pretrain a recurrent or transformer-based classifier. For NER,\nword embeddings initialize a BiLSTM sequence labeler. By synergizing\ntechniques, our hybrid approach achieves SOTA results on benchmark datasets,\npaving the way for more data-efficient and robust NLP systems.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-03T08:31:35Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-03T08:31:35Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention stability analysis\"*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs\nlike the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities\nintroduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications.

Pretraining Without Attention\n\n*From Search Query: \"SSM attention stability analysis\"*\n\n*Junxiong Wang, Jing Nathan Yan, Albert Gu, Alexander M. Rush*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been essential to pretraining success in NLP. While other\narchitectures have been used, downstream accuracy is either significantly\nworse, or requires attention layers to match standard benchmarks such as GLUE.\nThis work explores pretraining without attention by using recent advances in\nsequence routing based on state-space models (SSMs). Our proposed model,\nBidirectional Gated SSM (BiGS), combines SSM layers with a multiplicative\ngating architecture that has been effective in simplified sequence modeling\narchitectures. The model learns static layers that do not consider pair-wise\ninteractions. Even so, BiGS is able to match BERT pretraining accuracy on GLUE\nand can be extended to long-form pretraining of 4096 tokens without\napproximation.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient implementation\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

An optimized neural architecture search (NAS) recipe is also introduced which improves MNv4 search effectiveness. The integration of UIB, Mobile MQA and the refined NAS recipe results in a new suite of MNv4 models that are mostly Pareto optimal across mobile CPUs, DSPs, GPUs, as well as specialized accelerators like Apple Neural Engine and Google Pixel EdgeTPU - a characteristic not found in any other models tested.

Hardware-efficient entangled measurements for variational quantum algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient implementation\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Variational algorithms have received significant attention in recent years due to their potential to solve practical problems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A fundamental step of these algorithms is the evaluation of the expected value of Hamiltonians, and hence efficient schemes to perform this task are required. The standard approach employs local measurements of Pauli operators and requires a large number of circuits. An alternative is to make use of entangled measurements, which might introduce additional gates between physically disconnected qubits that harm the performance. As a solution to this problem, we propose hardware-efficient entangled measurements (HEEM), that is, measurements that permit only entanglement between physically connected qubits. We show that this strategy enhances the evaluation of molecular Hamiltonians in NISQ devices by reducing the number of circuits required without increasing their depth. We provide quantitative metrics of how this approach offers better results than local measurements and arbitrarily entangled measurements. We estimate the ground-state energy of the H$_2$O molecule with classical simulators and quantum hardware using the variational quantum eigensolver with HEEM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. HELP: Hardware-Adaptive Efficient Latency Prediction for NAS via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"hardware efficient implementation\"*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Song Chong, Sewoong Lee, Hayeon Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

Using Mamba2 blocks instead of Mamba1, applying LoRA projectors to shared MLP and attention blocks, and incorporating rotary position embeddings enhance the model's performance and efficiency.\n- **Layer-wise Nonlinearity and Sparse Activation**: Stacking state-space models with layer-wise nonlinear activation can approximate any continuous sequence-to-sequence relationship. Additionally, sparse activation techniques, such as those used in the \"Sparse Modular Activation\" approach, can reduce computation and memory consumption without sacrificing performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Stability Analysis and Convergence Properties\n\n- **Selective State Space Algorithm Integration**: The paper \"More Efficient and Effective Architecture for Language Modeling Tasks\" discusses integrating selective state space algorithms with quadratic self-attention algorithms. This integration helps in actively learning and updating context information, which improves stability and convergence. Using SSD as an internal function to selectively update context and attention as an external function enhances the model's stability and performance.\n- **Balancing SSM and Attention Components**: Careful balancing between SSM and attention components is crucial. The Zamba architecture's use of a single shared attention block or alternating between two shared attention blocks shows that the right balance can improve stability and performance.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations and Parallelization Strategies\n\n- **Efficient Inference and Memory Management**: Hybrid models like Zamba2 and Falcon-Mamba utilize techniques such as sequential prefill processing to mitigate memory scaling issues. This approach allows SSMs to process arbitrarily long prompts efficiently, reducing memory consumption compared to parallel prefill methods.\n- **Optimized Kernels and Hardware Utilization**: Using optimized Mamba kernels significantly reduces latency and memory usage. Running models on GPUs with specific configurations (e.g., `use_mamba_kernels=False` for CPU) can also optimize hardware utilization.\n\n## Memory Management Techniques\n\n- **State-Free Inference and Modular Activation**: State-free inference approaches and modular activation techniques can reduce memory overhead. The \"Sparse Modular Activation\" method allows elements to skip non-activated sub-modules, reducing memory consumption during both training and inference[Analysis Note].\n- **Constant State Size in SSMs**: Using SSMs like SSD, which have a constant state size, helps in managing memory efficiently, especially for long sequences. This is because SSMs do not require the storage of key-value caches like transformers do.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Different Integration Approaches\n\n- **Hybrid Architecture Performance**: Hybrid models like Zamba2 and Cheems show state-of-the-art performance among models of similar or larger sizes. These models achieve low perplexity, high accuracy in downstream tasks, and efficient inference with a smaller memory footprint.\n- **Comparative Evaluations**: Benchmarks comparing hybrid models (e.g., Zamba, Falcon-Mamba) with pure Transformer and SSM models highlight the advantages of hybrid architectures in terms of performance, latency, and memory efficiency. These evaluations demonstrate the versatility and performance of hybrid models across various tasks.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Cross-Domain Mixture of Experts**: The sparse activation mixture of experts architecture can train larger models in fewer steps with limited computational resources. This approach ensures that experts obtain non-overlapping knowledge, reducing redundancy and improving performance in fine-tuning and few-shot learning tasks.\n- **Rotation Position Encoding**: Using rotation position encoding matrices in hybrid architectures has been shown to be effective in enhancing performance. This encoding method is particularly beneficial when mixing selective state space algorithms with quadratic self-attention algorithms.\n\nBy integrating these techniques and insights, researchers can develop more efficient, stable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of both SSM and attention mechanisms.\n",

While FastTTTLinear attempts to address computational inefficiencies by using Gated Linear Attention and concepts from the RWKV architecture, it still faces limitations in capturing long-term dependencies effectively. State-space models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling long sequences with linear computational complexity. By integrating SSMs into FastTTTLinear, we aim to enhance its ability to model long-range dependencies efficiently and improve expressiveness without significantly increasing computational overhead.\n\n## Related Work\n\n### State-Space Models (SSMs)\n\n- **S4 (Structured State Space for Sequence Modeling)**: Introduced by Gu et al. (2021), S4 efficiently models long sequences by leveraging state-space representations with linear computational complexity.\n- **SPADE (State-space Augmented Transformer)**: Proposed by Zuo et al. (2022), SPADE integrates an SSM layer into the Transformer architecture to capture global information, complementing local attention mechanisms.\n- **LOCOST**: Presented by Le Bronnec et al. (2024), LOCOST uses an encoder based entirely on state-space models for long-document summarization, handling sequences up to 600K tokens efficiently.\n\n### FastTTTLinear\n\n- FastTTTLinear enhances the TTTLinear GAU by integrating Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and concepts from the RWKV architecture.\n- It focuses on computational efficiency and scalability but still relies on attention mechanisms that may not fully capture long-range dependencies.\n\n### Influence on Design Choices\n\n- **Integration of SSMs**: Inspired by SPADE and LOCOST, integrating an SSM layer into FastTTTLinear can improve long-sequence modeling.\n- **Hybrid Architecture**: Combining the strengths of SSMs and attention mechanisms can capture both global and local dependencies effectively.\n\n## Problem Analysis\n\n### Challenges\n\n1. **Modeling Long-Range Dependencies**: Capturing dependencies over long sequences is critical for tasks requiring context comprehension across thousands of tokens.\n2. **Computational Efficiency**: Enhancing expressiveness should not come at the cost of increased computational overhead.\n3. **Compatibility**: The integration must maintain compatibility with the autoregressive Transformer architecture and preserve parallelizability during training.\n\n### Key Concept\n\nIntegrate a state-space model (SSM) layer into FastTTTLinear to capture global, long-range dependencies efficiently. The SSM layer leverages the continuous-time dynamics of SSMs to model sequences with linear computational complexity, complementing the local modeling capabilities of the existing attention mechanism.\n\n### Theoretical Justification\n\n- **Linear Computational Complexity**: SSMs compute sequences with complexity \\( O(L) \\), where \\( L \\) is the sequence length.\n- **Expressiveness**: SSMs can capture long-range dependencies through the state dynamics governed by continuous-time equations.\n- **Complementarity**: By integrating an SSM layer, the model benefits from both efficient long-range modeling and the local expressiveness provided by attention mechanisms.\n\n### Trade-offs Addressed\n\n- **Computational Overhead**: The SSM layer introduces minimal overhead due to its linear complexity.\n- **Model Complexity**: The integration is designed to be modular, adding complexity only to the modified GAU without affecting the overall architecture.\n\n## Design Plan\n\n### Selected GAU to Modify\n\n```selection FastTTTLinear```\n\n### Modification Overview\n\nModify the **FastTTTLinear** GAU by integrating an SSM layer that captures global dependencies. The modified GAU, **SSMFastTTTLinear**, combines the strengths of Gated Linear Attention (GLA) and state-space modeling to efficiently handle long sequences.\n\n### Detailed Modifications\n\n#### 1. Integrate State-Space Model (SSM) Layer\n\n- **SSM Layer Placement**: Insert the SSM layer in parallel with the existing attention mechanism within FastTTTLinear.\n- **Purpose**: The SSM layer captures long-range dependencies, providing context-aware representations that complement the local attention outputs.\n\n#### 2.

State-Space Model Formulation\n\n- **State Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\frac{d\\mathbf{h}(t)}{dt} = \\mathbf{A}\\mathbf{h}(t) + \\mathbf{B}\\mathbf{x}(t)\n  \\]\n- **Output Equation**:\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{y}(t) = \\mathbf{C}\\mathbf{h}(t) + \\mathbf{D}\\mathbf{x}(t)\n  \\]\n- **Discretization**: Use bilinear (Tustin) transformation or other suitable methods to discretize the continuous equations for implementation.\n\n#### 4. Parameterization\n\n- **Structured Matrices**: Use diagonal plus low-rank parameterization for matrices \\(\\mathbf{A}\\), \\(\\mathbf{B}\\), \\(\\mathbf{C}\\), and \\(\\mathbf{D}\\) to maintain efficiency.\n- **Learnable Parameters**: The parameters of the SSM are learned jointly with the rest of the model.\n\n#### 5. Fusion and Normalization\n\n- **Normalization**: Apply LayerNorm or RMSNorm after the fusion to ensure stable training.\n- **Activation Function**: Use appropriate activation functions (e.g., SiLU) to introduce non-linearity.\n\n### Mathematical Formulations\n\n**State-Space Computations:**\n\n- Discretize the state-space equations over the sequence length \\( L \\):\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{h}_{k} = \\mathbf{A}_{d}\\mathbf{h}_{k-1} + \\mathbf{B}_{d}\\mathbf{x}_{k}\n  \\]\n  \n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{y}_{k} = \\mathbf{C}_{d}\\mathbf{h}_{k} + \\mathbf{D}_{d}\\mathbf{x}_{k}\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( \\mathbf{A}_{d} \\), \\( \\mathbf{B}_{d} \\), \\( \\mathbf{C}_{d} \\), and \\( \\mathbf{D}_{d} \\) are the discretized matrices.\n\n**Integration with Attention:**\n\n- **Attention Output**: \\( \\mathbf{a}_{k} \\) from the existing attention mechanism.\n- **Combined Output**:\n\n  \\[\n  \\mathbf{z}_{k} = \\mathbf{W}_{o} [\\mathbf{a}_{k}; \\mathbf{y}_{k}]\n  \\]\n\n  where \\( \\mathbf{W}_{o} \\) is a learnable projection matrix.\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-code for Modified GAU\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nfrom model_discovery.model.utils.modules import GAUBase\n\nclass SSMFastTTTLinear(GAUBase):\n    \"\"\"\n    SSMFastTTTLinear integrates a state-space model (SSM) layer into FastTTTLinear\n    to enhance long-sequence modeling capabilities.\n    \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, num_attention_heads=4, ssm_dim=None, **kwargs):\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        \n        #
