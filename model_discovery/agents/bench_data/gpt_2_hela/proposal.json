Comprehensive Analysis of Strengths and Concerns\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Alignment with Current Research Trends:**\n   - HELA's focus on optimizing memory efficiency and computational performance through IO-aware computation patterns and block-structured operations is well-aligned with contemporary advancements in linear attention mechanisms. It builds upon foundational works like **FlashAttention**, **Lightning Attention-2**, and **SPARSEK Attention**, which have demonstrated significant improvements in memory and speed efficiencies.\n\n2. **Structured Sparsity Integration:**\n   - Incorporating structured sparsity is a notable strength, as evidenced by methods like **SPARSEK Attention**. Structured sparsity effectively reduces memory footprint and computational overhead without substantially compromising performance, making HELA a promising approach for handling long sequences in autoregressive models.\n\n3. **Block-Structured Operations for Cache Optimization:**\n   - By dividing attention calculations into intra-block and inter-block components, HELA leverages cache-friendly computational patterns. This strategy enhances hardware utilization, particularly on GPU architectures, by optimizing memory access and reducing latency, as seen in **Lightning Attention-2**.\n\n4. **Efficient Gradient Computation:**\n   - Addressing gradient computation efficiency is crucial for training stability and speed. Techniques such as gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training, which are integral to **FlashAttention**, are well-considered in HELA's design, ensuring that training remains both efficient and robust.\n\n5. **Scalability and Flexibility:**\n   - HELA's design supports scalability by maintaining linear time complexity and constant memory footprint, essential for large-scale language models. Its adaptability to various hardware architectures through IO-aware and block-structured operations ensures broad applicability across different deployment environments.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n1. **Novelty and Differentiation:**\n   - While HELA incorporates several advanced techniques from existing methods like **FlashAttention** and **SPARSEK Attention**, its novelty appears incremental rather than groundbreaking. The integration of IO-aware computation and block-structured operations, though effective, closely mirrors strategies already employed in state-of-the-art models. This raises questions about whether HELA offers unique advantages or improvements beyond current methodologies.\n\n2. **Implementation Complexity:**\n   - The combination of multiple optimization strategies\u2014structured sparsity, block-wise computation, and efficient gradient handling\u2014introduces significant architectural complexity. Ensuring seamless integration of these components without introducing unforeseen issues or diminishing returns could pose practical challenges during implementation and deployment.\n\n3. **Empirical Validation:**\n   - The proposal lacks detailed empirical results demonstrating HELA's performance benchmarks compared to existing models. Without comprehensive evaluations on metrics such as perplexity, inference speed, and memory usage across diverse tasks, it's difficult to ascertain the practical benefits and potential trade-offs of HELA.\n\n4. **Balance Between Efficiency and Expressiveness:**\n   - While structured sparsity and efficient gradient computations enhance performance, they may inadvertently limit the model's expressiveness and ability to capture complex dependencies within the data. Ensuring that HELA maintains or improves upon the expressive capabilities of traditional attention mechanisms is essential to prevent a decline in model accuracy and robustness.\n\n5. **Hardware Dependency:**\n   - HELA's optimization strategies are heavily reliant on specific hardware architectures, particularly GPUs. This dependence may limit its applicability in environments with different or constrained hardware resources, potentially reducing its versatility and widespread adoption.\n\n#### 2. Constructive Suggestions for Improvements or Areas Needing Clarification\n\n1. **Enhance Novelty Through Unique Contributions:**\n   - To distinguish HELA from existing models, the proposal should emphasize unique features or innovations. This could include introducing adaptive tiling strategies that dynamically adjust based on input sequence characteristics or developing novel sparsity patterns that offer better performance-efficiency balances than current methods.\n\n2. **Provide Comprehensive Empirical Evaluations:**\n   - Incorporating detailed benchmark results comparing HELA with **FlashAttention**, **SPARSEK Attention**, and **Lightning Attention-2** is essential. Metrics should encompass perplexity, inference speed, memory usage, and performance across various downstream tasks. Such empirical data will substantiate HELA's claimed benefits and validate its effectiveness.\n\n3. **Simplify Architectural Complexity:**\n   - Streamlining the integration of multiple optimization strategies can mitigate implementation challenges. Exploring modular designs where each optimization component can be independently assessed and fine-tuned may enhance maintainability and reduce the risk of performance degradation.\n\n4. **Maintain or Enhance Model Expressiveness:**\n   - Implement mechanisms to ensure that the incorporation of structured sparsity and efficient gradient computations does not impede the model's ability to capture intricate data dependencies. Techniques such as residual connections or hybrid attention mechanisms can help preserve or even enhance expressiveness.\n\n5. **Broaden Hardware Compatibility:**\n   - While optimizing for specific hardware is advantageous, designing HELA with flexibility in mind can increase its applicability. Incorporating adjustable parameters or configurable modules that adapt to various hardware constraints can make HELA more versatile and facilitate broader adoption.\n\n6. **Explore Adaptive Sparsity and Tiling:**\n   - Investigate adaptive sparsity patterns that respond to the input data's complexity and structure. Similarly, adaptive tiling strategies that adjust block sizes based on sequence length and hardware capabilities can further optimize performance and resource utilization.\n\n7. **Provide Detailed Implementation Guidelines:**\n   - Expanding the pseudo-code with annotations or explanations of each component's role and interaction within HELA can aid in understanding and reproducing the model. Additionally, outlining potential challenges and proposed solutions during implementation can prepare for practical deployment scenarios.\n\n8. **Incorporate Feedback from Preliminary Experiments:**\n   - Sharing insights or findings from any preliminary experiments or simulations can provide a foundation for refining HELA's design. Highlighting successes and addressing early-stage challenges can guide further development and optimization efforts.\n\n#### 3.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.) This paper fleshes out the relationship between state space models and attention through the bridge of structured matrices.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nChung et al. 2014) as well as more modern variants such as the QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), SRU (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017), RWKV (B. Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 3. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 163  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 3. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 4. Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Computation-Efficient Era: A Comprehensive Survey of State Space Models in Medical Image Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Ilker Hacihaliloglu, Dorit Merhof, Ulas Bagci, Ali Diba, Reza Azad, Soheila Hatami, Afshin Bozorgpour, Bobby Azad, Sanaz Karimijafarbigloo, Sina Ghorbani Kolahi, Moein Heidari*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence modeling plays a vital role across various domains, with recurrent neural networks being historically the predominant method of performing these tasks. However, the emergence of transformers has altered this paradigm due to their superior performance. Built upon these advances, transformers have conjoined CNNs as two leading foundational models for learning visual representations. However, transformers are hindered by the $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of their attention mechanisms, while CNNs lack global receptive fields and dynamic weight allocation. State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the \\textit{\\textbf{Mamba}} model with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, have garnered immense interest lately in sequential modeling and visual representation learning, challenging the dominance of transformers by providing infinite context lengths and offering substantial efficiency maintaining linear complexity in the input sequence. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, medical imaging has heralded a new epoch with Mamba models. Intending to help researchers navigate the surge, this survey seeks to offer an encyclopedic review of Mamba models in medical imaging. Specifically, we start with a comprehensive theoretical review forming the basis of SSMs, including Mamba architecture and its alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context. Next, we offer a structured classification of Mamba models in the medical field and introduce a diverse categorization scheme based on their application, imaging modalities, and targeted organs. Finally, we summarize key challenges, discuss different future research directions of the SSMs in the medical domain, and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field. In addition, we have compiled the studies discussed in this paper along with their open-source implementations on our GitHub repository.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. V2M: Visual 2-Dimensional Mamba for Image Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models attention hardware efficiency*\n\n*Jiwen Lu, Jie zhou, Yuanhui Huang, Wenzhao Zheng, Chengkun Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Mamba has garnered widespread attention due to its flexible design and efficient hardware performance to process 1D sequences based on the state space model (SSM). Recent studies have attempted to apply Mamba to the visual domain by flattening 2D images into patches and then regarding them as a 1D sequence. To compensate for the 2D structure information loss (e.g., local similarity) of the original image, most existing methods focus on designing different orders to sequentially process the tokens, which could only alleviate this issue to some extent. In this paper, we propose a Visual 2-Dimensional Mamba (V2M) model as a complete solution, which directly processes image tokens in the 2D space. We first generalize SSM to the 2-dimensional space which generates the next state considering two adjacent states on both dimensions (e.g., columns and rows). We then construct our V2M based on the 2-dimensional SSM formulation and incorporate Mamba to achieve hardware-efficient parallel processing. The proposed V2M effectively incorporates the 2D locality prior yet inherits the efficiency and input-dependent scalability of Mamba. Extensive experimental results on ImageNet classification and downstream visual tasks including object detection and instance segmentation on COCO and semantic segmentation on ADE20K demonstrate the effectiveness of our V2M compared with other visual backbones.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating structured state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms, focusing on hardware efficiency and practical implementation details, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Integration of SSMs with Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper \"Transformers are SSMs\" introduces the concept of Structured State Space Duality (SSD) which bridges the gap between Transformers and SSMs. This work develops efficient algorithms for computing SSMs, such as the SSD algorithm, which leverages block decompositions of semiseparable matrices to achieve optimal efficiency trade-offs. This approach allows for linear scaling with sequence length and is hardware-friendly, primarily using matrix multiplications.\n\n## Hardware Efficiency\n\n- The SSD algorithm presented in the \"Transformers are SSMs\" paper is particularly noteworthy for its hardware efficiency. It combines linear SSM recurrence and quadratic dual forms, ensuring computation efficiency that scales linearly with sequence length. This approach requires \\(O(TN^2)\\) training flops, \\(O(TN)\\) inference flops, and \\(O(N^2)\\) inference memory, dominated by matrix multiplications. This makes it significantly faster than other implementations like Mamba's fused skin for large state expansions.\n\n## Practical Implementation Details\n\n- The Mamba model, discussed in the context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning, is a selective SSM that boasts fast inference and linear scaling in sequence length. It incorporates input-dependent SSM parameters and a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. This model matches the performance of attention architectures in natural language processing while offering significant improvements in efficiency.\n\n## State-Space Models and Attention\n\n- The Longhorn model, an advanced SSM, demonstrates how to integrate attention mechanisms efficiently. Longhorn outperforms state-of-the-art SSMs, including Mamba, on sequence modeling benchmarks. It uses a linear projection followed by a Conv1d operation and can extrapolate to long context lengths without significant perplexity drop, showcasing its efficiency and adaptability.\n\n## Memory Efficiency and Selective Computation\n\n- The concept of Structured Matrix Attention (SMA) from the \"Transformers are SSMs\" paper is crucial. SMA constructs a matrix by combining the product of queries and keys with a structured matrix, allowing for subquadratic computation. This approach enables selective computation based on input relevance, which can significantly reduce memory overhead and improve hardware efficiency.\n\n## Summary\n\n- **SSD Algorithm**: Offers a way to integrate SSMs with attention mechanisms efficiently, scaling linearly with sequence length and optimizing for hardware.\n- **Mamba Model**: Provides a practical implementation of SSMs with input-dependent parameters and hardware-aware algorithms, ensuring fast inference and linear scaling.\n- **Longhorn Model**: Demonstrates efficient integration of attention mechanisms within SSMs, allowing for long context lengths and low perplexity.\n- **SMA**: Enables selective computation and reduces memory overhead, enhancing hardware efficiency.\n\nThese findings and models provide a solid foundation for improving autoregressive language model design by leveraging the efficiency and scalability of structured state space models integrated with attention mechanisms.\n",

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

Recently, there has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence modeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the linear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates within the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model dubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes forget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound increases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to model long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local, short-term dependencies. Experiments on language modeling, image classification, and long-range arena benchmarks showcase the efficiency and effectiveness of our proposed model.

Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/37 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

Score: 0.71)\n\n*Annan Yu, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, is developed for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators, which allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also providing the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) that utilize linear, time-invariant (LTI) systems are known for their effectiveness in learning long sequences. However, these models typically face several challenges: (i) they require specifically designed initializations of the system matrices to achieve state-of-the-art performance, (ii) they require training of state matrices on a logarithmic scale with very small learning rates to prevent instabilities, and (iii) they require the model to have exponentially decaying memory in order to ensure an asymptotically stable LTI system. To address these issues, we view SSMs through the lens of Hankel operator theory, which provides us with a unified theory for the initialization and training of SSMs. Building on this theory, we develop a new parameterization scheme, called HOPE, for LTI systems that utilizes Markov parameters within Hankel operators. This approach allows for random initializations of the LTI systems and helps to improve training stability, while also provides the SSMs with non-decaying memory capabilities. Our model efficiently implements these innovations by nonuniformly sampling the transfer functions of LTI systems, and it requires fewer parameters compared to canonical SSMs. When benchmarked against HiPPO-initialized models such as S4 and S4D, an SSM parameterized by Hankel operators demonstrates improved performance on Long-Range Arena (LRA) tasks. Moreover, we use a sequential CIFAR-10 task with padded noise to empirically corroborate our SSM's long memory capacity.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/31 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

Muse: Text-To-Image Generation via Masked Generative Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Huiwen Chang, Han Zhang, Jarred Barber, AJ Maschinot, Jos\u00e9 Lezama, Lu Jiang, Ming Yang, K. Murphy, W. Freeman, Michael Rubinstein, Yuanzhen Li, Dilip Krishnan*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Muse, a text-to-image Transformer model that achieves state-of-the-art image generation performance while being significantly more efficient than diffusion or autoregressive models. Muse is trained on a masked modeling task in discrete token space: given the text embedding extracted from a pre-trained large language model (LLM), Muse is trained to predict randomly masked image tokens. Compared to pixel-space diffusion models, such as Imagen and DALL-E 2, Muse is significantly more efficient due to the use of discrete tokens and requiring fewer sampling iterations; compared to autoregressive models, such as Parti, Muse is more efficient due to the use of parallel decoding. The use of a pre-trained LLM enables fine-grained language understanding, translating to high-fidelity image generation and the understanding of visual concepts such as objects, their spatial relationships, pose, cardinality etc. Our 900M parameter model achieves a new SOTA on CC3M, with an FID score of 6.06. The Muse 3B parameter model achieves an FID of 7.88 on zero-shot COCO evaluation, along with a CLIP score of 0.32. Muse also directly enables a number of image editing applications without the need to fine-tune or invert the model: inpainting, outpainting, and mask-free editing.

PrimDiffusion: Volumetric Primitives Diffusion for 3D Human Generation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Zhaoxi Chen, Fangzhou Hong, Haiyi Mei, Guangcong Wang, Lei Yang, Ziwei Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The PrimDiffusion framework has three appealing properties: 1) compact and expressive parameter space for the diffusion model, 2) flexible 3D representation that incorporates human prior, and 3) decoder-free rendering for efficient novel-view and novel-pose synthesis.\n\n**Abstract:** We present PrimDiffusion, the first diffusion-based framework for 3D human generation. Devising diffusion models for 3D human generation is difficult due to the intensive computational cost of 3D representations and the articulated topology of 3D humans. To tackle these challenges, our key insight is operating the denoising diffusion process directly on a set of volumetric primitives, which models the human body as a number of small volumes with radiance and kinematic information. This volumetric primitives representation marries the capacity of volumetric representations with the efficiency of primitive-based rendering. Our PrimDiffusion framework has three appealing properties: 1) compact and expressive parameter space for the diffusion model, 2) flexible 3D representation that incorporates human prior, and 3) decoder-free rendering for efficient novel-view and novel-pose synthesis. Extensive experiments validate that PrimDiffusion outperforms state-of-the-art methods in 3D human generation. Notably, compared to GAN-based methods, our PrimDiffusion supports real-time rendering of high-quality 3D humans at a resolution of $512\\times512$ once the denoising process is done. We also demonstrate the flexibility of our framework on training-free conditional generation such as texture transfer and 3D inpainting.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Therefore, a compilation-based optimization \ufb02ow with automatic tensor generation and parameter tuning is necessary for ef\ufb01cient model deployment.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Latent State Space Models for Time-Series Generation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Linqi Zhou, Michael Poli, Winnie Xu, Stefano Massaroli, Stefano Ermon*\n\n**TL;DR:** LS4 is proposed, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity, and sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Methods based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are widely used to build generative models of time-series. In addition to high computational overhead due to explicitly computing hidden states recurrence, existing ODE-based models fall short in learning sequence data with sharp transitions - common in many real-world systems - due to numerical challenges during optimization. In this work, we propose LS4, a generative model for sequences with latent variables evolving according to a state space ODE to increase modeling capacity. Inspired by recent deep state space models (S4), we achieve speedups by leveraging a convolutional representation of LS4 which bypasses the explicit evaluation of hidden states. We show that LS4 significantly outperforms previous continuous-time generative models in terms of marginal distribution, classification, and prediction scores on real-world datasets in the Monash Forecasting Repository, and is capable of modeling highly stochastic data with sharp temporal transitions. LS4 sets state-of-the-art for continuous-time latent generative models, with significant improvement of mean squared error and tighter variational lower bounds on irregularly-sampled datasets, while also being x100 faster than other baselines on long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Kaplan, Tanishq Mathew Abraham, Alex Birch, Stefan Andreas Baumann, Katherine Crowson*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Hourglass Diffusion Transformer (HDiT), an image generative model that exhibits linear scaling with pixel count, supporting training at high-resolution (e.g. $1024 \\times 1024$) directly in pixel-space. Building on the Transformer architecture, which is known to scale to billions of parameters, it bridges the gap between the efficiency of convolutional U-Nets and the scalability of Transformers. HDiT trains successfully without typical high-resolution training techniques such as multiscale architectures, latent autoencoders or self-conditioning. We demonstrate that HDiT performs competitively with existing models on ImageNet $256^2$, and sets a new state-of-the-art for diffusion models on FFHQ-$1024^2$.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. Resource-efficient Machine Learning in 2 KB RAM for the Internet of Things\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation state space models*\n\n*Saurabh Goyal, Manik Varma, Ashish Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** \n    This paper develops a novel tree-based algorithm, called Bonsai, for efficient prediction on IoT devices \u2013 such as those based on the Arduino Uno board having an 8 bit ATmega328P microcontroller operating at 16 MHz with no native floating point support, 2 KB RAM and 32 KB read-only flash. Bonsai maintains prediction accuracy while minimizing model size and prediction costs by: (a) developing a tree model which learns a single, shallow, sparse tree with powerful nodes; (b) sparsely projecting all data into a low-dimensional space in which the tree is learnt; and (c) jointly learning all tree and projection parameters. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that Bonsai can make predictions in milliseconds even on slow microcontrollers, can fit in KB of memory, has lower battery consumption than all other algorithms while achieving prediction accuracies that can be as much as 30\\% higher than state-of-the-art methods for resource-efficient machine learning. Bonsai is also shown to generalize to other resource constrained settings beyond IoT by generating significantly better search results as compared to Bing\u2019s L3 ranker when the model size is restricted to 300 bytes. Bonsai\u2019s code can be downloaded from (http://www.manikvarma.org/code/Bonsai/download.html).\n  \n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2017-8\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using state space models (SSMs) and focusing on efficient parameter generation, dynamic adaptation, and stability, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Efficient Parameter Generation in SSMs\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Adjustment\nRecent advancements in SSMs, such as those introduced in the Mamba architecture, allow for dynamic parameter adjustment based on the input. This approach addresses the limitations of traditional time-invariant models, enabling more accurate and adaptive sequence modeling. For instance, the Mamba architecture proposes making SSM parameters input-dependent, which enhances the model's ability to perform content-based reasoning while maintaining efficiency.\n\n### State Space Duality (SSD)\nThe concept of State Space Duality (SSD) simplifies the matrix operations in SSMs, allowing for more efficient computation. SSD can reduce the state transition matrix to a scalar, which simplifies the quadratic form of the state space equations and makes them more suitable for implementation in modern computational frameworks. This approach is particularly beneficial for integrating SSMs with attention mechanisms, as it maintains linear complexity and improves hardware efficiency.\n\n## Stability and Training of Hybrid SSM-Attention Models\n\n### Structured State Space Models\nThe use of structured state space models, such as those in Mamba2, employs a scalar multiple of the identity matrix for the state transition, which allows for more efficient computation and better stability during training. This approach enables the model to be computed in chunks of linear attention blocks, leveraging tensor cores through matrix multiplication, which is more stable and efficient than traditional associative scan methods.\n\n### Hierarchical Processing and Short-Long Convolutions\nTechniques like CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention) propose using hierarchical processing with short-long convolutions to replace SSMs. This approach improves efficiency while maintaining global context, which can enhance the stability of the model by reducing the complexity of the computations involved (though not directly mentioned, the concept is relevant from the analysis note).\n\n## Optimizing Memory Access Patterns\n\n### Block-Wise Computation and Matrix Multiplication\nEfficient parameter generation and training can be achieved through block-wise computation patterns that improve cache utilization. Matrix multiplication-based algorithms, as used in Mamba2, enhance hardware efficiency by leveraging tensor cores, which reduces memory bandwidth requirements and improves overall performance.\n\n### IO-Aware Designs\nIO-aware designs are crucial for optimizing memory access patterns. By structuring the model to reduce memory bandwidth requirements, the model can be more efficient in both training and inference. This is particularly important for long sequences, where traditional transformer architectures face significant scalability challenges due to their quadratic complexity.\n\n## Key Techniques and Insights\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Adjustment**: Making SSM parameters input-dependent allows for content-based processing while maintaining efficiency.\n- **State Space Duality**: Simplifies matrix operations, enabling efficient integration with attention mechanisms and maintaining linear complexity.\n- **Structured State Space Models**: Using scalar multiples of the identity matrix for state transitions improves computation efficiency and stability.\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Short-long convolutions capture both local and global patterns, improving efficiency and expressivity (conceptually relevant).\n- **Block-Wise Computation and Matrix Multiplication**: Enhances hardware efficiency and reduces memory bandwidth requirements.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, stable, and adaptive autoregressive language models that leverage the strengths of state space models and attention mechanisms.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.71)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Scalable and Efficient Training of Large Convolutional Neural Networks with Differential Privacy\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Zhiqi Bu, J. Mao, Shiyun Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, is proposed that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Large convolutional neural networks (CNN) can be difficult to train in the differentially private (DP) regime, since the optimization algorithms require a computationally expensive operation, known as the per-sample gradient clipping. We propose an efficient and scalable implementation of this clipping on convolutional layers, termed as the mixed ghost clipping, that significantly eases the private training in terms of both time and space complexities, without affecting the accuracy. The improvement in efficiency is rigorously studied through the first complexity analysis for the mixed ghost clipping and existing DP training algorithms. Extensive experiments on vision classification tasks, with large ResNet, VGG, and Vision Transformers, demonstrate that DP training with mixed ghost clipping adds $1\\sim 10\\%$ memory overhead and $<2\\times$ slowdown to the standard non-private training. Specifically, when training VGG19 on CIFAR10, the mixed ghost clipping is $3\\times$ faster than state-of-the-art Opacus library with $18\\times$ larger maximum batch size. To emphasize the significance of efficient DP training on convolutional layers, we achieve 96.7\\% accuracy on CIFAR10 and 83.0\\% on CIFAR100 at $\\epsilon=1$ using BEiT, while the previous best results are 94.8\\% and 67.4\\%, respectively.

APG: Adaptive Parameter Generation Network for Click-Through Rate Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Bencheng Yan, Pengjie Wang, Kai Zhang, Feng Li, Jian Xu, Bo Zheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an efficient, effective, and universal module, named as Adaptive Parameter Generation network (APG), which can dynamically generate parameters for deep CTR models on-the-fly based on different instances.\n\n**Abstract:** In many web applications, deep learning-based CTR prediction models (deep CTR models for short) are widely adopted. Traditional deep CTR models learn patterns in a static manner, i.e., the network parameters are the same across all the instances. However, such a manner can hardly characterize each of the instances which may have different underlying distributions. It actually limits the representation power of deep CTR models, leading to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an efficient, effective, and universal module, named as Adaptive Parameter Generation network (APG), which can dynamically generate parameters for deep CTR models on-the-fly based on different instances. Extensive experimental evaluation results show that APG can be applied to a variety of deep CTR models and significantly improve their performance. Meanwhile, APG can reduce the time cost by 38.7\\% and memory usage by 96.6\\% compared to a regular deep CTR model. We have deployed APG in the industrial sponsored search system and achieved 3\\% CTR gain and 1\\% RPM gain respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Spiking PointNet: Spiking Neural Networks for Point Clouds\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Dayong Ren, Zhe Ma, Y. Chen, Weihang Peng, Xiaode Liu, Yuhan Zhang, Yu-Zhu Guo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Spiking PointNet is presented, the first spiking neural model for efficient deep learning on point clouds and can outperform its ANN counterpart, which is rare in the SNN field thus providing a potential research direction for the following work.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), enjoying extreme energy efficiency, have drawn much research attention on 2D visual recognition and shown gradually increasing application potential. However, it still remains underexplored whether SNNs can be generalized to 3D recognition. To this end, we present Spiking PointNet in the paper, the first spiking neural model for efficient deep learning on point clouds. We discover that the two huge obstacles limiting the application of SNNs in point clouds are: the intrinsic optimization obstacle of SNNs that impedes the training of a big spiking model with large time steps, and the expensive memory and computation cost of PointNet that makes training a big spiking point model unrealistic. To solve the problems simultaneously, we present a trained-less but learning-more paradigm for Spiking PointNet with theoretical justifications and in-depth experimental analysis. In specific, our Spiking PointNet is trained with only a single time step but can obtain better performance with multiple time steps inference, compared to the one trained directly with multiple time steps. We conduct various experiments on ModelNet10, ModelNet40 to demonstrate the effectiveness of Spiking PointNet. Notably, our Spiking PointNet even can outperform its ANN counterpart, which is rare in the SNN field thus providing a potential research direction for the following work. Moreover, Spiking PointNet shows impressive speedup and storage saving in the training phase.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Online Training Through Time for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Mingqing Xiao, Qingyan Meng, Zongpeng Zhang, D.K. He, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes online training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging instantaneous loss and gradients, and theoretically analyze and prove that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and recurrent conditions.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired energy-efficient models. Recent progress in training methods has enabled successful deep SNNs on large-scale tasks with low latency. Particularly, backpropagation through time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) is popularly used to achieve high performance in a very small number of time steps. However, it is at the cost of large memory consumption for training, lack of theoretical clarity for optimization, and inconsistency with the online property of biological learning and rules on neuromorphic hardware. Other works connect spike representations of SNNs with equivalent artificial neural network formulation and train SNNs by gradients from equivalent mappings to ensure descent directions. But they fail to achieve low latency and are also not online. In this work, we propose online training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging instantaneous loss and gradients. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze and prove that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and recurrent conditions. OTTT only requires constant training memory costs agnostic to time steps, avoiding the significant memory costs of BPTT for GPU training. Furthermore, the update rule of OTTT is in the form of three-factor Hebbian learning, which could pave a path for online on-chip learning. With OTTT, it is the first time that two mainstream supervised SNN training methods, BPTT with SG and spike representation-based training, are connected, and meanwhile in a biologically plausible form. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS demonstrate the superior performance of our method on large-scale static and neuromorphic datasets in small time steps.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5. Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling for Memory Efficient Adaptation of Language Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Guanchu Wang, Shaochen Zhong, Zhaozhuo Xu, D. Zha, Ruixiang Tang, Zhimeng Jiang, Kaixiong Zhou, V. Chaudhary, Shuai Xu, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient in a stochastic manner.\n\n**Abstract:** With the rapid growth in model size, fine-tuning the large pre-trained language model has become increasingly difficult due to its extensive memory usage. Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of trainable parameters in the network. While the model parameters do contribute to memory usage, the primary memory bottleneck during training arises from storing feature maps, also known as activations, as they are crucial for gradient calculation. Notably, neural networks are usually trained using stochastic gradient descent. We argue that in stochastic optimization, models can handle noisy gradients as long as the gradient estimator is unbiased with reasonable variance. Following this motivation, we propose a new family of unbiased estimators called WTA-CRS, for matrix production with reduced variance, which only requires storing the sub-sampled activations for calculating the gradient. Our work provides both theoretical and experimental evidence that, in the context of tuning transformers, our proposed estimators exhibit lower variance compared to existing ones. By replacing the linear operation with our approximated one in transformers, we can achieve up to 2.7$\\times$ peak memory reduction with almost no accuracy drop and enables up to $6.4\\times$ larger batch size. Under the same hardware, WTA-CRS enables better down-streaming task performance by applying larger models and/or faster training speed with larger batch sizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ACORN: Adaptive Coordinate Networks for Neural Scene Representation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Gordon Wetzstein, Marco Monteiro, Eric R. Chan, Connor Z. Lin, David B. Lindell, Julien N. P. Martel*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural representations have emerged as a new paradigm for applications in rendering, imaging, geometric modeling, and simulation. Compared to traditional representations such as meshes, point clouds, or volumes they can be flexibly incorporated into differentiable learning-based pipelines. While recent improvements to neural representations now make it possible to represent signals with fine details at moderate resolutions (e.g., for images and 3D shapes), adequately representing large-scale or complex scenes has proven a challenge. Current neural representations fail to accurately represent images at resolutions greater than a megapixel or 3D scenes with more than a few hundred thousand polygons. Here, we introduce a new hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture and training strategy that adaptively allocates resources during training and inference based on the local complexity of a signal of interest. Our approach uses a multiscale block-coordinate decomposition, similar to a quadtree or octree, that is optimized during training. The network architecture operates in two stages: using the bulk of the network parameters, a coordinate encoder generates a feature grid in a single forward pass. Then, hundreds or thousands of samples within each block can be efficiently evaluated using a lightweight feature decoder. With this hybrid implicit-explicit network architecture, we demonstrate the first experiments that fit gigapixel images to nearly 40 dB peak signal-to-noise ratio. Notably this represents an increase in scale of over 1000x compared to the resolution of previously demonstrated image-fitting experiments. Moreover, our approach is able to represent 3D shapes significantly faster and better than previous techniques; it reduces training times from days to hours or minutes and memory requirements by over an order of magnitude.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-06\n\n\n\n#### 2. AutoDNNchip: An Automated DNN Chip Predictor and Builder for Both FPGAs and ASICs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Yue Wang, Zetong Guan, Yongan Zhang, Yingyan Lin, Deming Chen, Cong Hao, Xiaofan Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Chaojian Li, Yang Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have fueled a growing demand for DNN chips. However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1) mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large design space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is needed to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition, which would require different hardware IPs to meet the application specifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset. Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip Predictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration, technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP selection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design via the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC). Furthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art accelerators.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. Improving Neural Network Training in Low Dimensional Random Bases\n\n*From Search Query: efficient parameter generation neural networks memory optimization*\n\n*Carlo Luschi, Zach Eaton-Rosen, Frithjof Gressmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) has proven to be remarkably effective in optimizing deep neural networks that employ ever-larger numbers of parameters. Yet, improving the efficiency of large-scale optimization remains a vital and highly active area of research. Recent work has shown that deep neural networks can be optimized in randomly-projected subspaces of much smaller dimensionality than their native parameter space. While such training is promising for more efficient and scalable optimization schemes, its practical application is limited by inferior optimization performance. Here, we improve on recent random subspace approaches as follows: Firstly, we show that keeping the random projection fixed throughout training is detrimental to optimization. We propose re-drawing the random subspace at each step, which yields significantly better performance. We realize further improvements by applying independent projections to different parts of the network, making the approximation more efficient as network dimensionality grows. To implement these experiments, we leverage hardware-accelerated pseudo-random number generation to construct the random projections on-demand at every optimization step, allowing us to distribute the computation of independent random directions across multiple workers with shared random seeds. This yields significant reductions in memory and is up to 10 times faster for the workloads in question.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model with a focus on efficient parameter generation, memory optimization, and hardware efficiency, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Efficient Parameter Generation\n\n### Hierarchical Parameter Networks\nUsing hierarchical parameter networks can be beneficial for generating context-dependent parameters efficiently.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 227  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 2. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

Dual Decomposition of Convex Optimization Layers for Consistent Attention in Medical Images\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Tom Ron, M. Weiler-Sagie, Tamir Hazan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a multi-layer attention mechanism that enforces consistent interpretations between attended convolutional layers using convex optimization and applies duality to decompose the consistency constraints between the layers by reparameterizing their attention probability distributions.\n\n**Abstract:** A key concern in integrating machine learning models in medicine is the ability to interpret their reasoning. Popular explainability methods have demonstrated satisfactory results in natural image recognition, yet in medical image analysis, many of these approaches provide partial and noisy explanations. Recently, attention mechanisms have shown compelling results both in their predictive performance and in their interpretable qualities. A fundamental trait of attention is that it leverages salient parts of the input which contribute to the model's prediction. To this end, our work focuses on the explanatory value of attention weight distributions. We propose a multi-layer attention mechanism that enforces consistent interpretations between attended convolutional layers using convex optimization. We apply duality to decompose the consistency constraints between the layers by reparameterizing their attention probability distributions. We further suggest learning the dual witness by optimizing with respect to our objective; thus, our implementation uses standard back-propagation, hence it is highly efficient. While preserving predictive performance, our proposed method leverages weakly annotated medical imaging data and provides complete and faithful explanations to the model's prediction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Methods for Non-stationary Online Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Peng Zhao, Yan-Feng Xie, Lijun Zhang, Zhi-Hua Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** Efficient methods for optimizing dynamic regret and adaptive regret are presented, which reduce the number of projections per round from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ to $1$.\n\n**Abstract:** Non-stationary online learning has drawn much attention in recent years. In particular, dynamic regret and adaptive regret are proposed as two principled performance measures for online convex optimization in non-stationary environments. To optimize them, a two-layer online ensemble is usually deployed due to the inherent uncertainty of the non-stationarity, in which a group of base-learners are maintained and a meta-algorithm is employed to track the best one on the fly. However, the two-layer structure raises the concern about the computational complexity -- those methods typically maintain $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ base-learners simultaneously for a $T$-round online game and thus perform multiple projections onto the feasible domain per round, which becomes the computational bottleneck when the domain is complicated. In this paper, we present efficient methods for optimizing dynamic regret and adaptive regret, which reduce the number of projections per round from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log T)$ to $1$.

Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Jian Ren, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Kamyar Salahi, Georgios Evangelidis, Yang Wen, Ju Hu, Yanyu Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. This work demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance even with MobileNet-level size and speed.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. Whisper in Medusa's Ear: Multi-head Efficient Decoding for Transformer-based ASR\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Joseph Keshet, Gill Hetz, Aviv Navon, Aviv Shamsian, Yael Segal-Feldman*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer-based models have significant potential for speech transcription and translation. Their self-attention mechanisms and parallel processing enable them to capture complex patterns and dependencies in audio sequences. However, this potential comes with challenges, as these large and computationally intensive models lead to slow inference speeds. Various optimization strategies have been proposed to improve performance, including efficient hardware utilization and algorithmic enhancements. In this paper, we introduce Whisper-Medusa, a novel approach designed to enhance processing speed with minimal impact on Word Error Rate (WER). The proposed model extends the OpenAI's Whisper architecture by predicting multiple tokens per iteration, resulting in a 50% reduction in latency. We showcase the effectiveness of Whisper-Medusa across different learning setups and datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Linear Attention Sequence Parallelism\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms hardware optimization*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Yu Qiao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence Parallel (SP) serves as a prevalent strategy to handle long sequences that exceed the memory limit of a single GPU. However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

This approach combines convolutional layers with transformer layers, allowing the model to ignore irrelevant regions and focus on critical areas, thus improving both accuracy and efficiency.\n\n### DuoAttention\nDuoAttention optimizes memory usage and computational efficiency by categorizing attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming types. This approach reduces memory requirements by up to 2.55\u00d7 for Multi-Head Attention models and speeds up decoding by up to 2.18\u00d7. It also allows for scalable processing of long contexts when combined with quantization.\n\n### FastAttention\nFastAttention extends the FlashAttention series to support low-resource GPUs and NPUs. It uses a two-level tiling strategy, an architecture-independent tiling-mask strategy, and integrates a tiling-AllReduce strategy to minimize communication overhead. This approach is particularly useful for optimizing attention computations on various hardware architectures, including those with limited resources.\n\n## Hardware Optimization\n\n### Memristor-Based Acceleration\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer networks. This approach performs matrix operations in an analog manner, reducing power consumption and latency. For example, the proposed memristor design for softmax calculations and attention mechanisms demonstrates improved efficiency with low power consumption and reduced latency.\n\n### Tiny-Transfer-Learning (TinyTL)\nTinyTL is a method for memory-efficient on-device learning that freezes the weights and only learns the bias modules, eliminating the need to store intermediate activations. This approach, combined with the lite residual module, provides significant memory savings (up to 6.5\u00d7) with minimal accuracy loss. It is particularly useful for deploying models on devices with tight memory budgets.\n\n### MCUNet\nMCUNet is a framework that co-designs efficient neural architectures (TinyNAS) and lightweight inference engines (TinyEngine) for microcontrollers. It optimizes the network architecture to fit resource constraints and reduces memory usage by 3.4\u00d7 while accelerating inference by 1.7-3.3\u00d7. This framework is crucial for achieving high performance on tiny IoT devices.\n\n## Key Insights and Techniques\n\n### IO-Aware Attention Computation\nFlashAttention and its variants (like FastAttention) demonstrate the importance of IO-aware attention computation, which reduces memory bandwidth requirements by using tiling and recomputation strategies. This approach is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes and can be adapted to different hardware architectures.\n\n### Block-Wise Computation\nTechniques like Ring Attention and FastAttention leverage block-wise computation to distribute long sequences across multiple devices, fully overlapping communication with computation. This strategy enables efficient parallelization and reduces memory usage.\n\n### Memory-Efficient Gradient Estimation\nMethods such as Winner-Take-All Column Row Sampling (WTA-CRS) enable efficient gradient computation by selectively sampling activations, which can achieve significant peak memory reduction with minimal accuracy drop[Analysis Note - Round 4].\n\nBy integrating these efficient attention mechanisms and hardware-aware design strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more memory-efficient, computationally efficient, and scalable across various hardware platforms.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion (Avg.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"gradient optimization in linear attention\" \"structured sparsity transformer\" \"cache-efficient linear attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

A Winnow-Based Approach to Context-Sensitive Spelling Correction\n\n*Andrew R. Golding, Dan Roth*\n\n**Abstract:** A large class of machine-learning problems in natural language require the\ncharacterization of linguistic context. Two characteristic properties of such\nproblems are that their feature space is of very high dimensionality, and their\ntarget concepts refer to only a small subset of the features in the space.\nUnder such conditions, multiplicative weight-update algorithms such as Winnow\nhave been shown to have exceptionally good theoretical properties. We present\nan algorithm combining variants of Winnow and weighted-majority voting, and\napply it to a problem in the aforementioned class: context-sensitive spelling\ncorrection. This is the task of fixing spelling errors that happen to result in\nvalid words, such as substituting \"to\" for \"too\", \"casual\" for \"causal\", etc.\nWe evaluate our algorithm, WinSpell, by comparing it against BaySpell, a\nstatistics-based method representing the state of the art for this task. We\nfind: (1) When run with a full (unpruned) set of features, WinSpell achieves\naccuracies significantly higher than BaySpell was able to achieve in either the\npruned or unpruned condition; (2) When compared with other systems in the\nliterature, WinSpell exhibits the highest performance; (3) The primary reason\nthat WinSpell outperforms BaySpell is that WinSpell learns a better linear\nseparator; (4) When run on a test set drawn from a different corpus than the\ntraining set was drawn from, WinSpell is better able than BaySpell to adapt,\nusing a strategy we will present that combines supervised learning on the\ntraining set with unsupervised learning on the (noisy) test set.\n\n**Published:** 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z  (*Updated: 1998-10-31T19:33:50Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

MaskGCT: Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech with Masked Generative Codec Transformer\n\n*Zhizheng Wu, Xueyao Zhang, Shunsi Zhang, Qiang Zhang, Jiachen Zheng, Haotian Guo, Ruihong Zeng, Liwei Liu, Haoyue Zhan, Yuancheng Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The recent large-scale text-to-speech (TTS) systems are usually grouped as autoregressive and non-autoregressive systems. The autoregressive systems implicitly model duration but exhibit certain deficiencies in robustness and lack of duration controllability. Non-autoregressive systems require explicit alignment information between text and speech during training and predict durations for linguistic units (e.g. phone), which may compromise their naturalness. In this paper, we introduce Masked Generative Codec Transformer (MaskGCT), a fully non-autoregressive TTS model that eliminates the need for explicit alignment information between text and speech supervision, as well as phone-level duration prediction. MaskGCT is a two-stage model: in the first stage, the model uses text to predict semantic tokens extracted from a speech self-supervised learning (SSL) model, and in the second stage, the model predicts acoustic tokens conditioned on these semantic tokens. MaskGCT follows the mask-and-predict learning paradigm. During training, MaskGCT learns to predict masked semantic or acoustic tokens based on given conditions and prompts. During inference, the model generates tokens of a specified length in a parallel manner. Experiments with 100K hours of in-the-wild speech demonstrate that MaskGCT outperforms the current state-of-the-art zero-shot TTS systems in terms of quality, similarity, and intelligibility.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Overlap with Existing Methods**: HELA's approach to integrating **structured sparsity** and **IO-aware computation** is closely aligned with methods like **SPARSEK Attention**, which selects a constant number of KV pairs per query, and **FlashAttention**, which optimizes memory access patterns through tiling. **Lightning Attention-2** further extends these optimizations for unlimited sequence lengths. These overlaps suggest that while HELA's objectives are relevant, its unique contributions need clear differentiation.\n\n- **Gradient Optimization**: Efficient gradient computation is pivotal for training large-scale models. **FlashAttention** employs gradient checkpointing and mixed-precision training to optimize memory usage and maintain training speed. HELA should consider adopting similar techniques to enhance gradient computation efficiency without sacrificing stability.\n\n- **Structured Sparsity**: The incorporation of structured sparsity, as demonstrated in **SPARSEK Attention**, significantly reduces memory footprint and computational overhead. HELA's focus on structured sparsity can borrow effective strategies from SPARSEK to maintain high performance while optimizing resource usage.\n\n- **Cache Optimization and Tiling**: Both **FlashAttention** and **Lightning Attention-2** utilize tiling strategies to optimize cache utilization and memory access patterns. HELA can adopt and potentially enhance these tiling techniques to maximize IO efficiency, ensuring that the attention computations are both memory and compute-efficient.\n\n- **Compression Techniques**: The work on **Compressing KV Heads** aligns with HELA's aim to reduce memory footprint. Implementing low-rank approximations or other compression techniques within HELA's structured sparsity framework can contribute to memory efficiency without compromising model performance.\n\n- **Performance Metrics**: Empirical validation is crucial. Comparing HELA against **SPARSEK Attention**, **FlashAttention**, **Lightning Attention-2**, and **Hedgehog** on benchmarks like WikiText-103 and GLUE will provide insights into HELA's relative performance in terms of perplexity, inference speed, and memory usage.\n\n- **Novel Contributions**: To establish its uniqueness, HELA should clearly delineate how its combination of IO-aware computation patterns and block-structured operations offers benefits beyond existing methods.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 2. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly.

Conclusion\n\nIn this paper, we introduced Lightning Attention-2, a pioneering implementation of linear attention that effectively harnesses its theoretical computational advantages, particularly in the causal setting. Our approach, which adopts the concepts of \"divide and conquer\" and tiling techniques, successfully addresses the limitations of current linear attention algorithms, especially the challenges associated with cumulative summation. By separating the computation into intrablock and inter-block components, we effectively leverage GPU hardware to its fullest potential, ensuring efficiency. Our extensive experiments across various model sizes and sequence lengths demonstrate that Lightning Attention-2 not only maintains consistent training speeds regardless of input sequence length but also outperforms existing state-ofthe-art attention mechanisms in terms of speed and accuracy. This breakthrough has profound implications for the future of large language models, particularly those requiring the processing of long sequences. Looking ahead, we intend to introduce sequence parallelism in conjunction with Lightning Attention-2, which aims to facilitate the training of extra-long sequences, effectively overcoming existing hardware constraints. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWith its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1.

The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 5. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.74)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 3 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"efficient gradient computation linear attention\" \"structured sparsity attention mechanisms\" \"cache optimization tiling strategies attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient gradient computation linear attention\" \"structured sparsity attention mechanisms\" \"cache optimization tiling strategies attention\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, existing SP\nmethods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in\nsub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based\nlanguage models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel\n(LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language\nmodels. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication\nmechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which\nsharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the\npractical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state\ncaching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters.\nFurthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP\nwith all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for\ndistributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches.\nWe conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with\nvarying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes.

Effectively Compress KV Heads for LLM\n\n*From Search Query: \"efficient gradient computation linear attention\" \"structured sparsity attention mechanisms\" \"cache optimization tiling strategies attention\"*\n\n*Hao Yu, Zelan Yang, Shen Li, Yong Li, Jianxin Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized\nvarious natural language processing tasks. These models predominantly employ an\nauto-regressive decoding mechanism that utilizes Key-Value (KV) caches to\neliminate redundant calculations for previous tokens. Nevertheless, as context\nlengths and batch sizes increase, the linear expansion in memory footprint of\nKV caches becomes a key bottleneck of LLM deployment, which decreases\ngeneration speeds significantly. To mitigate this issue, previous techniques\nlike multi-query attention (MQA) and grouped-query attention (GQA) have been\ndeveloped, in order to reduce KV heads to accelerate inference with comparable\naccuracy to multi-head attention (MHA). Despite their effectiveness, existing\nstrategies for compressing MHA often overlook the intrinsic properties of the\nKV caches. In this work, we explore the low-rank characteristics of the KV\ncaches and propose a novel approach for compressing KV heads. In particular, we\ncarefully optimize the MHA-to-GQA transformation to minimize compression error,\nand to remain compatible with rotary position embeddings (RoPE), we also\nintroduce specialized strategies for key caches with RoPE. We demonstrate that\nour method can compress half or even three-quarters of KV heads while\nmaintaining performance comparable to the original LLMs, which presents a\npromising direction for more efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11T08:37:33Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-11T08:37:33Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the **HardwareEfficientLinearAttention (HELA)**, that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are some key insights and recommendations based on the provided analysis and the need for further information.\n\n### Key Insights and Recommendations\n\n#### Gradient Optimization Techniques\nTo optimize gradient computations, the researcher should focus on techniques that maintain training stability and speed.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Overlapping Features with Existing Mechanisms**: The HELA proposal shares similarities with **SPARSEK Attention**, which integrates a scoring network and differentiable top-k mask operators to achieve linear time complexity and constant memory footprint. Additionally, **Treeformer** and **LASP** employ block-structured and hierarchical attention mechanisms to optimize computation and memory usage.

For instance, **SPARSEK Attention** maintains performance by carefully selecting key-value pairs, but this may limit the model's ability to capture certain dependencies. HELA must balance these trade-offs to ensure that efficiency gains do not come at the expense of model accuracy or robustness.\n\n- **Integration with Existing Architectures**: The ability of HELA to seamlessly integrate with pre-trained models is crucial for practical adoption. Drawing parallels with **SPARSEK Attention**, which can be integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, HELA should emphasize its compatibility and ease of integration to facilitate broader usage.\n\n- **Benchmarking and Empirical Validation**: To substantiate its claims, HELA must undergo rigorous empirical validation, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art implementations like **FlashAttention**, **Lightning Attention-2**, and **SPARSEK Attention**.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/41 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nFor linear attention, we utilize the kernelization proposed by Katharopoulos et al. [38]. Additionally, we compare our methods to recent linear attention works that employ their own architectures rather than the GPT-2 architecture: GLA [77] and RetNet [67]. As the smallest GLA and RetNet is 340 M , We modify their hyperparameters to align with our setting. Detailed hyperparameters and results of other configurations can be found in Appendix C.1. We trained all models on the OpenWebText ${ }^{3}$ corpus for 10,000 steps, varying the context length. The results are presented in Table 1. Our SPARSEK+SW method consistently outperforms all previously\n\n[^2]established efficient attention methods. Particularly, SparseK+SW offers superior performance and has lower time complexity compared to previous learnable sparse attention methods, such as hash attention. Furthermore, linear attention methods, such as Linear+SW, GLA, and RetNet, demonstrate limitations, particularly in modeling long contexts. However, when combining linear attention with SPARSEK attention, we observed additional performance gains over SPARSEK+SW, even surpassing full attention. This suggests the potential of exploring a mixture of different attention methods for more efficient modeling. ### 4.2 Fine-tuning Existing Models\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-08.jpg?height=349&width=1354&top_left_y=656&top_left_x=381)\n\nFigure 2: Perplexity on the held-out set of fine-tuned models. L denotes the training context length. We replace the standard full attention in Pythia 160M, Pythia 410M [6] and TinyLlama 1.1B [80] with our SPARSEK attention and sliding window attention. The models are then fine-tuned over a few steps to ensure compatibility with the modified attention modules. Here we only consider sliding window attention because other efficient attention methods often require additional changes of the model architecture and sliding window attention is reported to be efficient in Chen et al. [11]. In fine-tuning, the NTK-aware interpolation [7] is adopted to extend the limit of pretrained positional encodings. For the Pythia models, we utilize a $1 \\%$ sampled subset of the SlimPajama dataset ${ }^{4}$ [63] to perform fine-tuning on moderate-length settings (i.e., 4 k and 8 k ). In contrast, we use an upsampled dataset comprising long documents [25] to fine-tune the TinyLlama models on long-length settings (i.e., 8 k and 16 k ). Training hyperparameters are listed in Appendix C.2. In Figure 2, we report the perplexity on the held-out set across various levels of sparsity and training context lengths. Extending the training context length and increasing the context size generally benefit all types of attention mechanisms. When matching the KV size, our SparseK+SW attention consistently outperforms sliding window attention. For the TinyLlama models, SparseK+SW attention achieves comparable perplexity using only half the KV size required by sliding window attention. These results underscore the advantages of a more adaptable context as implemented in SparseK+SW. We further evaluate TinyLlama 1.1B, fine-tuned with an 8 k context window, across additional tasks as presented in the following sections. ### 4.3 Retrieval-based Evaluation and Length Extrapolation\n\nA common concern with sparse attention is its potential to neglect informative history. To investigate this, we evaluated our fine-tuned models on the passkey retrieval task [47], along with two baseline methods that require no training: dynamic NTK [7, 23] and LM-Infinite [33]. The results are presented in Figure 3a. It is evident that the sliding window approach fails even within the trained context length. Furthermore, among the training-free methods, NTK utilizes full attention and extends the context length by a factor of four, whereas the memory-efficient method LM-Infinite fails in extrapolation. In contrast, SPARSEK+SW is memory-efficient while maintaining performance for context lengths well beyond four times longer. We also analyze the perplexity of tokens in various positional buckets within a long context, as depicted in Figure 3b. In the language modeling task, SW demonstrates the ability to effectively manage contexts four times longer than standard models, although it is less competitive in relatively short contexts. While SPARSEK+SW fails at contexts extending to 26 k tokens, it outperforms both NTK and fine-tuned full attention models.

The choice of language is based on the fact that the training corpus of TinyLlama is primarily in English. We test all models using greedy decoding, with the evaluation context size set to 8192 . All results are presented in Table 2. Full attention offers the best performance but incurs the highest memory cost. Sliding window attention is memory-efficient; however, it results in significant performance degradation. In contrast, our SPARSEK+SW attention not only demonstrates strong performance but also achieves high memory efficiency. Notably, SPARSEK+SW outperforms the training-free method, NTK, and the inference-time KV cache compression method, H2O [81]. This suggests the benefits of maintaining consistency between training and inference. However, SparseK+SW underperforms fine-tuned full attention, representing a trade-off between efficiency and performance. Table 2: Results on LongBench. * denotes that the method is training-free. ${ }^{\\dagger}$ We use 512 globel (heavy-hitter) KV cache and 512 local KV cache in H2O. | Model | Single-Doc QA |  |  | Multi-Doc QA |  |  | Summarziation |  |  | Few-shot Learning |  |  | Synthetic |  | Code |  | Avg. |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| NTK $^{*}$ <br> $w=8192$ | 4.34 | 10.30 | 14.54 | 6.49 | 9.19 | 3.49 | 11.77 | 7.84 | 3.62 | 49.5 | 55.17 | 22.66 | 1.21 | 3.38 | 52.19 | 48.90 | 19.04 |\n| Full <br> $w=8192$ | 3.95 | 13.07 | 13.16 | 6.81 | 10.77 | 3.51 | 15.17 | 6.12 | 8.30 | 61.00 | 65.15 | 26.02 | 0.39 | 2.37 | 56.72 | 50.36 | 21.42 |\n| SW <br> $w=1024$ | 1.34 | 8.69 | 5.41 | 2.76 | 4.46 | 0.48 | 11.78 | 4.25 | 2.39 | 25.50 | 13.43 | 5.33 | 2.3 | 0.50 | 52.22 | 27.50 | 10.52 |\n| SparseK+SW <br> $k=w=512$ | 5.19 | 14.29 | 13.24 | 6.85 | 9.21 | 3.83 | 14.11 | 5.97 | 5.85 | 55.00 | 52.06 | 24.79 | 0.61 | 2.61 | 53.90 | 50.89 | 19.90 |\n\n## 5 Conclusion\n\nWe propose SpArSEK attention, a new approach to sparse attention that achieves both computational and memory efficiency. Within self-attention, we use an additional scoring network evaluating the importance of each key-value pair and select the top- $k$ pairs. We propose the differentiable SPARSEK operator, a relaxation of TOPK, to enable gradient-based optimization.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1. Speed Showdown: FlashAttention vs. Lightning Attention in Expanding Sequence Lengths and Model Sizes. The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Overlapping Features with Existing Mechanisms**: The HELA proposal shares similarities with **SPARSEK Attention**, which integrates a scoring network and differentiable top-k mask operators to achieve linear time complexity and constant memory footprint. Additionally, **Treeformer** and **LASP** employ block-structured and hierarchical attention mechanisms to optimize computation and memory usage. This indicates that HELA's approach to block-structured operations and IO-aware computation is aligned with current research trends but may lack unique differentiators.\n\n- **Gradient Optimization**: Efficient gradient computation is critical for training large-scale models. Techniques such as **gradient checkpointing** and **mixed precision training**, as utilized in **FlashAttention**, are essential for maintaining training stability and speed. HELA should explore integrating these techniques to enhance gradient computation efficiency.\n\n- **Structured Sparsity and Block-Based Attention**: Incorporating structured sparsity, as seen in **SPARSEK Attention** and **Treeformer**, can significantly reduce the memory footprint and computational overhead. HELA's focus on structured sparsity aligns with these approaches, but it must ensure that the sparsity patterns and block structuring introduced offer distinct advantages or improvements over existing methods.\n\n- **Cache Optimization and Tiling Strategies**: Both **FlashAttention** and **Lightning Attention-2** utilize tiling strategies to optimize memory access patterns and cache utilization. HELA should adopt similar tiling techniques, possibly enhancing them with novel optimizations tailored to specific hardware architectures, to maximize IO efficiency.\n\n- **Performance Trade-offs**: While structured sparsity and efficient gradient computations offer significant benefits, they may introduce trade-offs in model expressiveness and flexibility. For instance, **SPARSEK Attention** maintains performance by carefully selecting key-value pairs, but this may limit the model's ability to capture certain dependencies. HELA must balance these trade-offs to ensure that efficiency gains do not come at the expense of model accuracy or robustness.\n\n- **Integration with Existing Architectures**: The ability of HELA to seamlessly integrate with pre-trained models is crucial for practical adoption. Drawing parallels with **SPARSEK Attention**, which can be integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, HELA should emphasize its compatibility and ease of integration to facilitate broader usage.\n\n- **Benchmarking and Empirical Validation**: To substantiate its claims, HELA must undergo rigorous empirical validation, comparing its performance against state-of-the-art implementations like **FlashAttention**, **Lightning Attention-2**, and **SPARSEK Attention**. Metrics should include perplexity, training and inference speed, memory usage, and performance across diverse downstream tasks.\n\n- **Hardware Considerations**: HELA's emphasis on hardware-efficient implementations requires a deep understanding of specific hardware architectures. Collaborating with hardware optimization experts or leveraging existing frameworks that offer low-level optimizations can enhance HELA's performance on targeted hardware platforms.\n\n- **Novel Contributions**: To establish its novelty, HELA should clearly delineate how its integration of IO-aware computation patterns and block-structured operations offers benefits beyond existing methods. Potential avenues include introducing adaptive tiling strategies, novel sparsity patterns, or advanced gradient optimization techniques that are not present in current literature.\n\n#### 4.
