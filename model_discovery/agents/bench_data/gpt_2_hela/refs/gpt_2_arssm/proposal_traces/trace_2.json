FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.46)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/36 (Score: 0.35)*\n\n```\n# Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms \n\nAndr\u00e9 F.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nRecently, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have shown immense capability in sequential modeling and been widely used in various areas, such as natural language processing\n\n[^0](Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), time series analysis (Zhou et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021b; Janner et al., 2021). Based on attention mechanisms, Transformers can learn the relation between each pair of tokens in a sequence. However, suffering from the quadratic complexity of pairwise relation modeling, it is computationally prohibitive for Transformers to deal with long sequences and scale up to bigger models. To tackle this essential obstacle for foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), efficient and linear Transformers have been explored. One category of methods attempts to utilize the sparsity to reduce the model captured relations (Child et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020). By substituting the dense matrix to a sparse version, these models can obtain a lower complexity but inevitably sacrifice some valuable information, leading to the trade-off dilemma between efficiency and performance. Another mainstream category tries to abandon the computationconsuming query-key multiplication in the attention mechanism. The typical method is to substitute or approximate the softmax-based similarity in Transformers. For example, Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) introduces the decomposition method for similarity calculation and further bypasses the query-key multiplication through the associativity of matrix multiplication. However, without using the softmax function, these methods cannot guarantee the distinguishability of attention. This may result in nearuniform attention of each token to all other tokens, namely the degenerated attention, which damages the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. Although some works try to incorporate the concentration property to avoid the trivial attention (Luo et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2022), they have to reintroduce specific inductive biases to Transformers, such as the locality in sequence, sacrificing the model generality. Thus, how to simultaneously obtain the non-trivial attention and maintain the generality as the canonical attention is the key challenge in the advance of linearizing Transformers. Previous works demonstrate that the softmax function is essential to avoid the trivial attention (Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021). It is well-known that the softmax function is originally proposed as a differentiable generalization of the \"winner-take-all\" picking maximum operation (Bridle, 1989). Thus, the softmax function can introduce\nthe competition among tokens in the attention mechanism, enforcing higher attention only to the essential tokens and thereby avoiding near-uniform attention weights. Based on this insight, it is a natural solution to empower transformers with built-in competition property to generate informative attention that guarantees the modeling capability. However, the competition mechanism is irrealizable for linear Transformers because the attention weights to compete will incur the quadratic complexity. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we attempt to reconstruct the attention mechanism from a new view of flow network (Ahuja et al., 1993), where the competition property is naturally achieved. Note that a flow network is a directed graph with information flows from one node to another under the constraint of flow capacity. Correspondingly, the attention mechanism can be reformulated as aggregating the information from sources (i.e., values) to sinks (i.e., results) through the learned flow capacities (i.e., attentions). We further find that by conserving the incoming flow capacity for each sink, the outgoing flow capacities of sources will compete with each other. And by conserving the outgoing flow capacity of sources, we can also obtain the competed incoming flow capacities of sinks. Thus, benefiting from the flow conservation in flow network, the competition mechanism can be accomplished without specific inductive biases. Based on the above insights, we introduce the flow conservation to the attention mechanism and further propose the Flow-Attention mechanism, which can avoid the trivial attention and simultaneously be free from specific inductive biases. Technically, by conserving the incoming flow of sinks (i.e., results), the source competition mechanism is accomplished and then applied for the non-trivial information aggregation. After the information aggregation, the sink allocation mechanism is obtained by conserving the outgoing flow of sources (i.e., values) and then applied to filter the aggregated information. Empowered by the Flow-Attention, Flowformer in linear complexity achieves competitive or better performance as the canonical Transformer in extensive areas. The contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- This paper analyzes the attention mechanism from the new view of the flow network. By introducing the flow conservation to both the source and sink aspects, the competition among tokens is naturally achieved. - Based on flow conservation, we propose the FlowAttention with source competition and sink allocation mechanisms, which can avoid degenerated attentions without incorporating specific inductive biases. - Empowered by Flow-Attention, our proposed Flowformer yields strong performance in linear time on five benchmarks, covering wide areas: long sequence, language, vision, time series and reinforcement learning.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/33 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nSee Appendix D. 2 for the case study in attention visualization. ### 4.5. Reinforcement Learning\n\nSetup. We consider the continuous control tasks from D4RL benchmark (Fu et al., 2020) to evaluate the model performance on the offline reinforcement learning (Offline RL) (Lange et al., 2012; Levine et al., 2020). We select the HalfCheetah, Hopper and Walker as experiment environments, which are to control the movement of robot. To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, we experiment on different datasets pre-collected with three different behavior policies: Medium-Expert, Medium and Medium-Replay. Since the offline RL is an autoregressive task, it can also be used to testify the causal-version Flow-Attention. For comparison, we include the Decision Transformer (DT, Chen et al. 2021a), Behavior Cloning (BC, Pomerleau 1989), AWAC (Nair et al., 2020), Linear Transformer (Linear Trans., (Katharopoulos et al., 2020)), Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021) and cosFormer (Zhen et al., 2022) as baselines, where DT is the state-of-the-art models for offline RL and adopts the canonical Transformer as the backbone. We adopt 3 layers with 256 hidden channels and 4 heads in all experiments for Flowformer and other Transformers. We repeat each experiment three times with different seeds on one single NVIDIA 2080 Ti GPU for 10 epochs. Results. As shown in Table 7, it is notable that compared to the vanilla Transformer used in DT, previous efficient Transformers degenerate a lot and cannot provide a stable result. Especially, the averaged rewards of Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) and Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021) decrease se- riously ( 72.2 v.s. 63.9 and 63.8 respectively), indicating that the locally sensitive hashing or random Fourier features may be not suitable for the global dependency modeling under the reinforcement learning context. In contrast, Flowformer still shows a competitive performance on this challenging control task in the comparison with DT (72.2 v.s. 73.5), justifying the generality of our proposed Flowformer in offline reinforcement learning. ## 5. Conclusions\n\nThis paper focuses on Transformer linearization and attempts to tackle this problem from a new view of the flow network. By introducing the flow conservation to the attention mechanism, we present the Flow-Attention mechanism, which can naturally achieve the competition mechanism for sources and the allocation mechanism for sinks to filter the aggregated source information. Empowered by FlowAttention, Flowformer can achieve the linear complexity and avoid degenerated attention without specific inductive biases. With great generality, Flowformer achieves the strong performance on extensive areas, covering vision, language, long sequence, time series, and reinforcement learning. Our future work includes scaling up the proposed efficient Flowformer to build general-purpose pre-trained models facilitating a wider range of upstream and downstream tasks. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the National Key Research and Development Plan (2020AAA0109201), National Natural Science Foundation of China (62022050 and 62021002), Beijing Nova Program (Z201100006820041), and BNRist Innovation Fund (BNR2021RC01002). ## References\n\nAhuja, R.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing.

Reinforcement Learning of Implicit and Explicit Control Flow in Instructions\n\n*From Search Query: control flow attention*\n\n*Ethan A. Brooks, Janarthanan Rajendran, Richard L. Lewis, Satinder Singh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An attention-based architecture is formulated that meets the problem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step execution of instructions by learning to flexibly attend to and condition behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning to flexibly follow task instructions in dynamic environments poses interesting challenges for reinforcement learning agents. We focus here on the problem of learning control flow that deviates from a strict step-by-step execution of instructions\u2014that is, control flow that may skip forward over parts of the instructions or return backward to previously completed or skipped steps. Demand for such flexible control arises in two fundamental ways: explicitly when control is specified in the instructions themselves (such as conditional branching and looping) and implicitly when stochastic environment dynamics require re-completion of instructions whose effects have been perturbed, or opportunistic skipping of instructions whose effects are already present. We formulate an attention-based architecture that meets these challenges by learning, from task reward only, to flexibly attend to and condition behavior on an internal encoding of the instructions. We test the architecture\u2019s ability to learn both explicit and implicit control in two illustrative domains\u2014one inspired by Minecraft and the other by StarCraft\u2014and show that the architecture exhibits zero-shot generalization to novel instructions of length greater than those in a training set, at a performance level unmatched by three baseline recurrent architectures and one ablation architecture.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Sequential Flow Control Framework for Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: control flow attention*\n\n*Minghui Xie, Chuzhan Hao, Peng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple but effective GRU-inspired Flow Control (GFC) framework to model sequential logic in the whole multi-hop process and achieves new state-of-the-art Hits@1 of 76.8% on WebQSP and is also effective when KB is incomplete.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the key challenges of knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is the multi-hop reasoning. Since in different hops, one attends to different parts of question, it is important to dynamically represent the question semantics for each hop. Existing methods, however, (i) infer the dynamic question representation only through coarse-grained attention mechanisms, which may bring information loss, (ii) and have not effectively modeled the sequential logic, which is crucial for the multi-hop reasoning process in KBQA.To address these issues, we propose a sequential reasoning self-attention mechanism to capture the crucial reasoning information of each single hop in a more fine-grained way. Based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which is good at modeling sequential process, we propose a simple but effective GRU-inspired Flow Control (GFC) framework to model sequential logic in the whole multi-hop process.Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superior effectiveness of our model. In particular, GFC achieves new state-of-the-art Hits@1 of 76.8% on WebQSP and is also effective when KB is incomplete.

Hardness of Independent Learning and Sparse Equilibrium Computation in Markov Games\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation*\n\n*Dylan J. Foster, Noah Golowich, S. Kakade*\n\n**TL;DR:** The crux of the approach is a novel application of aggregation techniques from online learning, whereby any algorithm for the SparseCCE problem can be used to compute approximate Nash equilibria for non-zero sum normal-form games.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the problem of decentralized multi-agent reinforcement learning in Markov games. A fundamental question is whether there exist algorithms that, when adopted by all agents and run independently in a decentralized fashion, lead to no-regret for each player, analogous to celebrated convergence results in normal-form games. While recent work has shown that such algorithms exist for restricted settings (notably, when regret is defined with respect to deviations to Markovian policies), the question of whether independent no-regret learning can be achieved in the standard Markov game framework was open. We provide a decisive negative resolution this problem, both from a computational and statistical perspective. We show that: - Under the widely-believed assumption that PPAD-hard problems cannot be solved in polynomial time, there is no polynomial-time algorithm that attains no-regret in general-sum Markov games when executed independently by all players, even when the game is known to the algorithm designer and the number of players is a small constant. - When the game is unknown, no algorithm, regardless of computational efficiency, can achieve no-regret without observing a number of episodes that is exponential in the number of players. Perhaps surprisingly, our lower bounds hold even for seemingly easier setting in which all agents are controlled by a a centralized algorithm. They are proven via lower bounds for a simpler problem we refer to as SparseCCE, in which the goal is to compute a coarse correlated equilibrium that is sparse in the sense that it can be represented as a mixture of a small number of product policies. The crux of our approach is a novel application of aggregation techniques from online learning, whereby we show that any algorithm for the SparseCCE problem can be used to compute approximate Nash equilibria for non-zero sum normal-form games.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Privacy Induces Robustness: Information-Computation Gaps and Sparse Mean Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation*\n\n*Kristian Georgiev, Samuel B. Hopkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We establish a simple connection between robust and differentially-private algorithms: private mechanisms which perform well with very high probability are automatically robust in the sense that they retain accuracy even if a constant fraction of the samples they receive are adversarially corrupted. Since optimal mechanisms typically achieve these high success probabilities, our results imply that optimal private mechanisms for many basic statistics problems are robust. We investigate the consequences of this observation for both algorithms and computational complexity across different statistical problems. Assuming the Brennan-Bresler secret-leakage planted clique conjecture, we demonstrate a fundamental tradeoff between computational efficiency, privacy leakage, and success probability for sparse mean estimation. Private algorithms which match this tradeoff are not yet known -- we achieve that (up to polylogarithmic factors) in a polynomially-large range of parameters via the Sum-of-Squares method. To establish an information-computation gap for private sparse mean estimation, we also design new (exponential-time) mechanisms using fewer samples than efficient algorithms must use. Finally, we give evidence for privacy-induced information-computation gaps for several other statistics and learning problems, including PAC learning parity functions and estimation of the mean of a multivariate Gaussian.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient neural networks*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on various models, datasets, and tasks consistently validate the efficacy of ShiftAddNAS, e.g., achieving up to a +7.7% higher accuracy or a +4.9 better BLEU score compared to state-of-the-art NN, while leading to up to 93% or 69% energy and latency savings, respectively.

Generalized Depthwise-Separable Convolutions for Adversarially Robust and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient neural networks*\n\n*Hassan Dbouk, Naresh R Shanbhag*\n\n**TL;DR:** The method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution is proposed -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution that dramatically improves the throughput of aStandard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their tremendous successes, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) incur high computational/storage costs and are vulnerable to adversarial perturbations. Recent works on robust model compression address these challenges by combining model compression techniques with adversarial training. But these methods are unable to improve throughput (frames-per-second) on real-life hardware while simultaneously preserving robustness to adversarial perturbations. To overcome this problem, we propose the method of Generalized Depthwise-Separable (GDWS) convolution -- an efficient, universal, post-training approximation of a standard 2D convolution. GDWS dramatically improves the throughput of a standard pre-trained network on real-life hardware while preserving its robustness. Lastly, GDWS is scalable to large problem sizes since it operates on pre-trained models and doesn't require any additional training. We establish the optimality of GDWS as a 2D convolution approximator and present exact algorithms for constructing optimal GDWS convolutions under complexity and error constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of GDWS via extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, SVHN, and ImageNet datasets.

Our algorithm is general, as it applies to arbitrary (unstructured) sparsity and common layer types (e.g., convolutional or linear). We provide a fast vectorized implementation on commodity CPUs, and show that it can yield speedups in end-to-end runtime experiments, both in transfer learning using already-sparsified networks, and in training sparse networks from scratch.

Simultaneous Computation and Memory Efficient Zeroth-Order Optimizer for\n  Fine-Tuning Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation*\n\n*Fei Wang, Li Shen, Liang Ding, Chao Xue, Ye Liu, Changxing Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning is powerful for adapting large language models to downstream\ntasks, but it often results in huge memory usages. A promising approach to\nmitigate this is using Zeroth-Order (ZO) optimization, which estimates\ngradients to replace First-Order (FO) gradient calculations, albeit with longer\ntraining time due to its stochastic nature. By revisiting the Memory-efficient\nZO (MeZO) optimizer, we discover that the full-parameter perturbation and\nupdating processes consume over 50% of its overall fine-tuning time cost. Based\non these observations, we introduce a novel layer-wise sparse computation and\nmemory efficient ZO optimizer, named LeZO. LeZO treats layers as fundamental\nunits for sparsification and dynamically perturbs different parameter subsets\nin each step to achieve full-parameter fine-tuning. LeZO incorporates\nlayer-wise parameter sparsity in the process of simultaneous perturbation\nstochastic approximation (SPSA) and ZO stochastic gradient descent (ZO-SGD). It\nachieves accelerated computation during perturbation and updating processes\nwithout additional memory overhead. We conduct extensive experiments with the\nOPT model family on the SuperGLUE benchmark and two generative tasks. The\nexperiments show that LeZO accelerates training without compromising the\nperformance of ZO optimization. Specifically, it achieves over 3x speedup\ncompared to MeZO on the SST-2, BoolQ, and Copa tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-13T12:47:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-13T12:47:37Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Learning to Execute Programs with Instruction Pointer Attention Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: control flow attention*\n\n*Daniel Tarlow, Hugo Larochelle, Charles Sutton, David Bieber*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for learning software engineering tasks including code completion, bug finding, and program repair. They benefit from leveraging program structure like control flow graphs, but they are not well-suited to tasks like program execution that require far more sequential reasoning steps than number of GNN propagation steps. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, are well-suited to long sequential chains of reasoning, but they do not naturally incorporate program structure and generally perform worse on the above tasks. Our aim is to achieve the best of both worlds, and we do so by introducing a novel GNN architecture, the Instruction Pointer Attention Graph Neural Networks (IPA-GNN), which achieves improved systematic generalization on the task of learning to execute programs using control flow graphs. The model arises by considering RNNs operating on program traces with branch decisions as latent variables. The IPA-GNN can be seen either as a continuous relaxation of the RNN model or as a GNN variant more tailored to execution. To test the models, we propose evaluating systematic generalization on learning to execute using control flow graphs, which tests sequential reasoning and use of program structure. More practically, we evaluate these models on the task of learning to execute partial programs, as might arise if using the model as a heuristic function in program synthesis. Results show that the IPA-GNN outperforms a variety of RNN and GNN baselines on both tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n#### 2. MossFormer2: Combining Transformer and RNN-Free Recurrent Network for Enhanced Time-Domain Monaural Speech Separation\n\n*From Search Query: control flow attention*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Our previously proposed MossFormer has achieved promising performance in monaural speech separation. However, it predominantly adopts a self-attention-based MossFormer module, which tends to emphasize longer-range, coarser-scale dependencies, with a deficiency in effectively modelling finer-scale recurrent patterns. In this paper, we introduce a novel hybrid model that provides the capabilities to model both long-range, coarse-scale dependencies and fine-scale recurrent patterns by integrating a recurrent module into the MossFormer framework. Instead of applying the recurrent neural networks (RNNs) that use traditional recurrent connections, we present a recurrent module based on a feedforward sequential memory network (FSMN), which is considered \"RNN-free\" recurrent network due to the ability to capture recurrent patterns without using recurrent connections. Our recurrent module mainly comprises an enhanced dilated FSMN block by using gated convolutional units (GCU) and dense connections. In addition, a bottleneck layer and an output layer are also added for controlling information flow. The recurrent module relies on linear projections and convolutions for seamless, parallel processing of the entire sequence. The integrated MossFormer2 hybrid model demonstrates remarkable enhancements over MossFormer and surpasses other state-of-the-art methods in WSJ0-2/3mix, Libri2Mix, and WHAM!/WHAMR! benchmarks.\n\n**Conference:** mossformer2-combining-transformer-and-rnn\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Based on an imperative programming language, DiffTaichi generates gradients of simulation steps using source code transformations that preserve arithmetic intensity and parallelism. A light-weight tape is used to record the whole simulation program structure and replay the gradient kernels in a reversed order, for end-to-end backpropagation. We demonstrate the performance and productivity of our language in gradient-based learning and optimization tasks on 10 different physical simulators. For example, a differentiable elastic object simulator written in our language is 4.2x shorter than the hand-engineered CUDA version yet runs as fast, and is 188x faster than the TensorFlow implementation. Using our differentiable programs, neural network controllers are typically optimized within only tens of iterations.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks for Pixelwise Classification on Heterogeneous Hardware Systems\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient neural networks*\n\n*Fabian Tschopp*\n\n**Abstract:** This work presents and analyzes three convolutional neural network (CNN)\nmodels for efficient pixelwise classification of images. When using\nconvolutional neural networks to classify single pixels in patches of a whole\nimage, a lot of redundant computations are carried out when using sliding\nwindow networks. This set of new architectures solve this issue by either\nremoving redundant computations or using fully convolutional architectures that\ninherently predict many pixels at once.\n  The implementations of the three models are accessible through a new utility\non top of the Caffe library. The utility provides support for a wide range of\nimage input and output formats, pre-processing parameters and methods to\nequalize the label histogram during training. The Caffe library has been\nextended by new layers and a new backend for availability on a wider range of\nhardware such as CPUs and GPUs through OpenCL.\n  On AMD GPUs, speedups of $54\\times$ (SK-Net), $437\\times$ (U-Net) and\n$320\\times$ (USK-Net) have been observed, taking the SK equivalent SW (sliding\nwindow) network as the baseline. The label throughput is up to one megapixel\nper second.\n  The analyzed neural networks have distinctive characteristics that apply\nduring training or processing, and not every data set is suitable to every\narchitecture. The quality of the predictions is assessed on two neural tissue\ndata sets, of which one is the ISBI 2012 challenge data set. Two different loss\nfunctions, Malis loss and Softmax loss, were used during training.\n  The whole pipeline, consisting of models, interface and modified Caffe\nlibrary, is available as Open Source software under the working title Project\nGreentea.\n\n**Published:** 2015-09-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design focusing on control flow mechanisms, sparse computation, and hardware efficiency, here are some key points and directions based on the provided keywords and analysis:\n\n## Dynamic Routing Patterns in Neural Networks\n\n- **Control Flow Attention**: The concept of \"control flow attention\" introduces dynamic routing patterns based on input content. This approach allows for efficient processing by adapting the attention mechanism to the specific input, which can be particularly beneficial in autoregressive models. For instance, the \"Efficient Attention via Control Flow\" paper suggests that dynamic routing can maintain expressiveness while reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Sparse Computation Techniques\n\n- **Sparse Attention Mechanisms**: Recent research emphasizes the use of sparse attention patterns to reduce computational costs. Sparse attention mechanisms can be designed to focus only on relevant parts of the input sequence, thereby reducing the number of computations required. This is aligned with the idea of \"hardware-aware neural architectures\" that consider the constraints and capabilities of the hardware to optimize performance.\n- **Structured State Space Models (SSMs)**: SSMs with structured parameterizations can be particularly efficient when combined with sparse computation techniques. These models can be optimized for hardware efficiency, making them suitable for large-scale autoregressive language models.\n\n## Theoretical Foundations of Structured Attention Mechanisms\n\n- **Structured Attention**: Theoretical foundations of structured attention mechanisms involve understanding how to parameterize attention in a way that maintains expressiveness while being computationally efficient. This includes exploring different types of attention mechanisms, such as hierarchical or block-sparse attention, which can be more efficient than traditional dense attention mechanisms.\n- **Control Flow in Neural Networks**: Theoretical analysis of control flow in neural networks can help in designing models that dynamically adjust their computation paths based on the input. This can be achieved through mechanisms like those described in \"Efficient Attention via Control Flow,\" which adapt the computation flow to the input content.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Control Flow Based Architectures\n\n- **Performance Evaluation**: Evaluating the performance of control flow based architectures involves assessing their efficiency, accuracy, and scalability. This includes analyzing the trade-offs between computational efficiency, memory usage, and model capacity. For example, \"Hardware-Aware Neural Architectures\" highlights the importance of designing models with explicit consideration of hardware constraints to achieve significant efficiency gains without sacrificing model capacity.\n- **Case Studies and Benchmarks**: Conducting case studies and benchmarks on various datasets can provide insights into how different control flow mechanisms and sparse computation techniques impact the performance of autoregressive language models. This would help in identifying the most effective approaches for different scenarios.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Attention Mechanisms in Transformers**: While the provided sources do not directly discuss Transformers, it is crucial to consider how attention mechanisms in Transformer architectures can be optimized using control flow and sparse computation techniques. For instance, adapting the attention mechanism to dynamically route information based on input content can enhance efficiency and performance.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more efficient in terms of computation and hardware resources but also maintain or improve their performance and scalability.\n",

In particular, Bahdanau et al. (2015); Cho et al. (2014); Vaswani et al. (2017) relied on attention to drastically improve the state-of-the art in machine translation. Subsequent research (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019) demonstrated the power of\n\n[^0]self-attention in learning powerful representations of language to address several natural language processing tasks. Self-attention also brought impressive progress for generative modeling outside of language, e.g. image (Parmar et al., 2018; Menick and Kalchbrenner, 2018; Child et al., 2019) and music generation (Huang et al., 2018; Child et al., 2019). Self-attention operates over sequences in a stepwise manner: at every time-step, attention assigns an attention weight to each previous input element (representation of past time-steps) and uses these weights to compute the representation of the current time-step as a weighted sum of the past input elements (Vaswani et al., 2017). Self-attention (Shaw et al., 2018) is a particular case of attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015; Chorowski et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Self-attention is commonly used in autoregressive generative models. These models generate observations step-by-step, modeling the probability of the next symbol given the previously generated ones. At every time step, self-attentive generative models can directly focus on any part of the previous context. In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have direct interactions with only a local neighborhood of context around the current time step. This advantage however comes at a price: unlike recurrent networks or convolution networks, the time and space complexity of self-attention is quadratic in $n$, the length of the sequence. Specifically, for every position $i \\leq n$, self-attention computes weights for its whole context of length $i$, which induces a complexity of $\\sum_{i \\leq n} i=n(n-1) / 2$. This makes it difficult to scale attention based models to modeling long sequences. However, long sequences are the norm in many domains, including music, image, speech, video generation and document level machine translation. Therefore, an important research direction is to investigate sparse and memory efficient forms of attention in order to scale to tasks with large sequence lengths. Previous work has proposed data independent or fixed sparsity patterns bounding temporal\ndependencies, such as local or strided attention. At each time step, the model attends only to a fixed number of time steps in the past (Child et al., 2019). Extensions to local attention have suggested learning the length of the temporal sparsity for each attention module in the network (Sukhbaatar et al., 2019). These strategies draw their inspiration from RNNs and CNNs and bound their complexity by attending only to representations summarizing a local neighborhood of the current time step. Their attention matrices (matrices containing the attention weights for every pair of previous, current timestep) are natively sparse and require instantiating only non-zero entries. While these approaches have achieved good results, fixing the sparsity pattern of a content based mechanism such as self-attention can limit its ability to pool in information from large contexts. As an alternative to local attention, Correia et al. (2019) consider content-based sparsity, an approach allowing for arbitrary sparsity patterns. This formulation however does require instantiating a full dense attention matrix prior to sparsification through variants of $L_{0}$-sparsity or sparsemax approximations (Blondel et al., 2019). The present work builds upon these two lines of research and proposes to retain the modeling flexibility of content-based sparse attention while leveraging the efficiency of natively sparse attention matrices. Our formulation avoids sparsemax variants and relies on clustering of attention instead. Each attention module considers a clustering of the space: the current time-step only attends to context belonging to the same cluster. In other words, the current time-step query is routed to a limited number of context elements through its cluster assignment. This strategy draws inspiration from the application of spherical $k$-means clustering to the Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) problem. Our proposed model, Routing Transformer, combines our efficient clustering-based sparse attention with classical local attention to reach excellent performance both for language and image generation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/50 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nWe also report competitive results on enwik-8 ( 0.99 vs 0.98 perplexity) and present ablations on CIFAR-10. ## 2 Related Work\n\nAttention with Temporal Sparsity: Research on efficient attention neural models parallels the advent of attention-based architectures. In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 2. Flowformer: Linearizing Transformers with Conservation Flows  (Avg.

Introduction\n\nRecently, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have shown immense capability in sequential modeling and been widely used in various areas, such as natural language processing\n\n[^0](Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), time series analysis (Zhou et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021b; Janner et al., 2021). Based on attention mechanisms, Transformers can learn the relation between each pair of tokens in a sequence. However, suffering from the quadratic complexity of pairwise relation modeling, it is computationally prohibitive for Transformers to deal with long sequences and scale up to bigger models. To tackle this essential obstacle for foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), efficient and linear Transformers have been explored. One category of methods attempts to utilize the sparsity to reduce the model captured relations (Child et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020). By substituting the dense matrix to a sparse version, these models can obtain a lower complexity but inevitably sacrifice some valuable information, leading to the trade-off dilemma between efficiency and performance. Another mainstream category tries to abandon the computationconsuming query-key multiplication in the attention mechanism. The typical method is to substitute or approximate the softmax-based similarity in Transformers. For example, Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) introduces the decomposition method for similarity calculation and further bypasses the query-key multiplication through the associativity of matrix multiplication. However, without using the softmax function, these methods cannot guarantee the distinguishability of attention. This may result in nearuniform attention of each token to all other tokens, namely the degenerated attention, which damages the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. Although some works try to incorporate the concentration property to avoid the trivial attention (Luo et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2022), they have to reintroduce specific inductive biases to Transformers, such as the locality in sequence, sacrificing the model generality. Thus, how to simultaneously obtain the non-trivial attention and maintain the generality as the canonical attention is the key challenge in the advance of linearizing Transformers. Previous works demonstrate that the softmax function is essential to avoid the trivial attention (Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021). It is well-known that the softmax function is originally proposed as a differentiable generalization of the \"winner-take-all\" picking maximum operation (Bridle, 1989). Thus, the softmax function can introduce\nthe competition among tokens in the attention mechanism, enforcing higher attention only to the essential tokens and thereby avoiding near-uniform attention weights. Based on this insight, it is a natural solution to empower transformers with built-in competition property to generate informative attention that guarantees the modeling capability. However, the competition mechanism is irrealizable for linear Transformers because the attention weights to compete will incur the quadratic complexity. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we attempt to reconstruct the attention mechanism from a new view of flow network (Ahuja et al., 1993), where the competition property is naturally achieved. Note that a flow network is a directed graph with information flows from one node to another under the constraint of flow capacity. Correspondingly, the attention mechanism can be reformulated as aggregating the information from sources (i.e., values) to sinks (i.e., results) through the learned flow capacities (i.e., attentions). We further find that by conserving the incoming flow capacity for each sink, the outgoing flow capacities of sources will compete with each other. And by conserving the outgoing flow capacity of sources, we can also obtain the competed incoming flow capacities of sinks. Thus, benefiting from the flow conservation in flow network, the competition mechanism can be accomplished without specific inductive biases. Based on the above insights, we introduce the flow conservation to the attention mechanism and further propose the Flow-Attention mechanism, which can avoid the trivial attention and simultaneously be free from specific inductive biases. Technically, by conserving the incoming flow of sinks (i.e., results), the source competition mechanism is accomplished and then applied for the non-trivial information aggregation. After the information aggregation, the sink allocation mechanism is obtained by conserving the outgoing flow of sources (i.e., values) and then applied to filter the aggregated information. Empowered by the Flow-Attention, Flowformer in linear complexity achieves competitive or better performance as the canonical Transformer in extensive areas. The contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- This paper analyzes the attention mechanism from the new view of the flow network. By introducing the flow conservation to both the source and sink aspects, the competition among tokens is naturally achieved. - Based on flow conservation, we propose the FlowAttention with source competition and sink allocation mechanisms, which can avoid degenerated attentions without incorporating specific inductive biases. - Empowered by Flow-Attention, our proposed Flowformer yields strong performance in linear time on five benchmarks, covering wide areas: long sequence, language, vision, time series and reinforcement learning.\n```\n\n#### 3. Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, M. Shoeybi, T.

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3.

Self-Supervised Learning of Event-Based Optical Flow with Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: flow-based networks*\n\n*F. Paredes-Vall\u00e9s, J. Hagenaars, G. D. Croon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This article focuses on the complex task of learning to estimate optical flow from event-based camera inputs in a self-supervised manner, and modify the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline to encode minimal temporal information in its inputs to improve its convexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of neuromorphic computing promises extremely low-power and low-latency sensing and processing. Challenges in transferring learning algorithms from traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs) to spiking neural networks (SNNs) have so far prevented their application to large-scale, complex regression tasks. Furthermore, realizing a truly asynchronous and fully neuromorphic pipeline that maximally attains the abovementioned benefits involves rethinking the way in which this pipeline takes in and accumulates information. In the case of perception, spikes would be passed as-is and one-by-one between an event camera and an SNN, meaning all temporal integration of information must happen inside the network. In this article, we tackle these two problems. We focus on the complex task of learning to estimate optical flow from event-based camera inputs in a self-supervised manner, and modify the state-of-the-art ANN training pipeline to encode minimal temporal information in its inputs. Moreover, we reformulate the self-supervised loss function for event-based optical flow to improve its convexity. We perform experiments with various types of recurrent ANNs and SNNs using the proposed pipeline. Concerning SNNs, we investigate the effects of elements such as parameter initialization and optimization, surrogate gradient shape, and adaptive neuronal mechanisms. We find that initialization and surrogate gradient width play a crucial part in enabling learning with sparse inputs, while the inclusion of adaptivity and learnable neuronal parameters can improve performance. We show that the performance of the proposed ANNs and SNNs are on par with that of the current state-of-the-art ANNs trained in a self-supervised manner.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 117  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 5.

To tackle this issue, we investigate the challenge of training GANs with limited data, and propose a novel regularization method based on the idea of renormalization group (RG) in physics.We observe that in the limited data setting, the gradient pattern that the generator obtains from the discriminator becomes more aggregated over time. In RG context, this aggregated pattern exhibits a high discrepancy from its coarse-grained versions, which implies a high-capacity and sensitive system, prone to overfitting and collapse. To address this problem, we introduce a \\textbf{m}ulti-\\textbf{s}cale \\textbf{s}tructural \\textbf{s}elf-\\textbf{d}issimilarity (MS$^3$D) regularization, which constrains the gradient field to have a consistent pattern across different scales, thereby fostering a more redundant and robust system.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient routing*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 7.

Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Routing to the Expert: Efficient Reward-guided Ensemble of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient routing*\n\n*Keming Lu, Hongyi Yuan, Runji Lin, Junyang Lin, Zheng Yuan, Chang Zhou, Jingren Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** ZOOTER is proposed, a reward-guided routing method distilling rewards on training queries to train a routing function, which can precisely distribute each query to the LLM with expertise about it, and shows computation efficiency in inference.\n\n**Abstract:** The complementary potential of Large Language Models (LLM) assumes off-the-shelf LLMs have heterogeneous expertise in a wide range of domains and tasks so that an ensemble of LLMs can achieve consistently better performance. Existing ensemble methods for LLMs mainly focus on reward model ranking of outputs, leading to significant computation overhead. To combat this issue, we revisit the complementary potential of LLMs and further elaborate on it by mining latent expertise with off-the-shelf reward models. We propose ZOOTER, a reward-guided routing method distilling rewards on training queries to train a routing function, which can precisely distribute each query to the LLM with expertise about it. We also integrate a tag-based label enhancement to mitigate noise from uncertainty when using rewards as silver supervision.

SPECTRA: Sparse Structured Text Rationalization\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective rationalization aims to produce decisions along with rationales\n(e.g., text highlights or word alignments between two sentences). Commonly,\nrationales are modeled as stochastic binary masks, requiring sampling-based\ngradient estimators, which complicates training and requires careful\nhyperparameter tuning. Sparse attention mechanisms are a deterministic\nalternative, but they lack a way to regularize the rationale extraction (e.g.,\nto control the sparsity of a text highlight or the number of alignments). In\nthis paper, we present a unified framework for deterministic extraction of\nstructured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a\ndifferentiable layer. Our approach greatly eases training and rationale\nregularization, generally outperforming previous work on what comes to\nperformance and plausibility of the extracted rationales. We further provide a\ncomparative study of stochastic and deterministic methods for rationale\nextraction for classification and natural language inference tasks, jointly\nassessing their predictive power, quality of the explanations, and model\nvariability.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-09T20:39:56Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-09T20:39:56Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more\ninterpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its\nsparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

A Regularized Framework for Sparse and Structured Neural Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Mathieu Blondel, Vlad Niculae*\n\n**Abstract:** Modern neural networks are often augmented with an attention mechanism, which\ntells the network where to focus within the input. We propose in this paper a\nnew framework for sparse and structured attention, building upon a smoothed max\noperator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from\nreal values to probabilities, suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework\nincludes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax\nas special cases. However, we also show how our framework can incorporate\nmodern structured penalties, resulting in more interpretable attention\nmechanisms, that focus on entire segments or groups of an input. We derive\nefficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our\nattention mechanisms, enabling their use in a neural network trained with\nbackpropagation. To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for\nexisting ones, we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks:\ntextual entailment, machine translation, and sentence summarization. Our\nattention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance;\nnotably, on textual entailment and summarization, we outperform the standard\nattention mechanisms based on softmax and sparsemax.\n\n**Conference:** a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 3.

MegaBlocks: Efficient Sparse Training with Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient routing*\n\n*Matei Zaharia, Cliff Young, Deepak Narayanan, Trevor Gale*\n\n**Abstract:** We present MegaBlocks, a system for efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) training on GPUs. Our system is motivated by the limitations of current frameworks, which restrict the dynamic routing in MoE layers to satisfy the constraints of existing software and hardware. These formulations force a tradeoff between model quality and hardware efficiency, as users must choose between dropping tokens from the computation or wasting computation and memory on padding. To address these limitations, we reformulate MoE computation in terms of block-sparse operations and develop new block-sparse GPU kernels that efficiently handle the dynamism present in MoEs. Our approach never drops tokens and maps efficiently to modern hardware, enabling end-to-end training speedups of up to 40% over MoEs trained with the state-of-the-art Tutel library and 2.4x over DNNs trained with the highly-optimized Megatron-LM framework.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. An Abstract Model and Efficient Routing for Logical Entangling Gates on Zoned Neutral Atom Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient routing*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent experimental achievements have demonstrated the potential of neutral atom architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computing. These architectures feature the dynamic rearrangement of atoms during computation, enabling nearly arbitrary two-dimensional rearrangements. Additionally, they employ a zoned layout with dedicated regions for entangling, storage, and readout. This architecture requires design automation software that efficiently compiles quantum circuits to this hardware and takes care that atoms are in the right place at the right time. In this paper, we initiate this line of work by providing, (1) an abstract model of the novel architecture and, (2) an efficient solution to the routing problem of entangling gates. By this, we aim to maximize the parallelism of entangling gates and minimize the overhead caused by the routing of atoms between zones. In addition to that, we keep the realm of fault-tolerant quantum computing in mind and consider logical qubit arrays, each of which encodes one logical qubit. We implemented the proposed idea as a tool called NALAC and demonstrated its effectiveness and efficiency by showing that it can significantly reduce the routing overhead of logical entangling gates compared to the naive approach. As part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT), NALAC is publicly available as open-source at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qmap.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model (LM) using the specified keywords and analysis, here are some key points and references that can guide the researcher:\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Structured Sparsity**:\n   - The concept of sparse attention mechanisms is crucial for reducing computational complexity while maintaining model expressiveness.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization.

Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 4. An Attention Free Transformer (Avg.

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/28 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: flow-based sparse attention*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Kernelised Normalising Flows\n\n*From Search Query: flow-based sparse attention*\n\n*Eshant English, Matthias Kirchler, C. Lippert*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised normalising flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework, demonstrating that a kernelised flow can yield competitive or superior results compared to neural network-based flows whilst maintaining parameter efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Normalising Flows are non-parametric statistical models characterised by their dual capabilities of density estimation and generation. This duality requires an inherently invertible architecture. However, the requirement of invertibility imposes constraints on their expressiveness, necessitating a large number of parameters and innovative architectural designs to achieve good results. Whilst flow-based models predominantly rely on neural-network-based transformations for expressive designs, alternative transformation methods have received limited attention. In this work, we present Ferumal flow, a novel kernelised normalising flow paradigm that integrates kernels into the framework. Our results demonstrate that a kernelised flow can yield competitive or superior results compared to neural network-based flows whilst maintaining parameter efficiency. Kernelised flows excel especially in the low-data regime, enabling flexible non-parametric density estimation in applications with sparse data availability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Survival of the Most Influential Prompts: Efficient Black-Box Prompt Search via Clustering and Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering mechanisms*\n\n*Han Zhou, Xingchen Wan, Ivan Vuli'c, Anna Korhonen*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Prompt-based learning has been an effective paradigm for large pretrained language models (LLM), enabling few-shot or even zero-shot learning. Black-box prompt search has received growing interest recently for its distinctive properties of gradient-free optimization, proven particularly useful and powerful for model-as-a-service usage. However, the discrete nature and the complexity of combinatorial optimization hinder the efficiency of modern black-box approaches. Despite extensive research on search algorithms, the crucial aspect of search space design and optimization has been largely overlooked. In this paper, we first conduct a sensitivity analysis by prompting LLM, revealing that only a small number of tokens exert a disproportionate amount of influence on LLM predictions. Leveraging this insight, we propose the Clustering and Pruning for Efficient Black-box Prompt Search (ClaPS), a simple black-box search method that first clusters and prunes the search space to focus exclusively on influential prompt tokens. By employing even simple search methods within the pruned search space, ClaPS achieves state-of-the-art performance across various tasks and LLMs, surpassing the performance of complex approaches while significantly reducing search costs. Our findings underscore the critical role of search space design and optimization in enhancing both the usefulness and the efficiency of black-box prompt-based learning.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Efficient Online Clustering with Moving Costs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering mechanisms*\n\n*Dimitrios Christou, Stratis Skoulakis, V. Cevher*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents the first O (log n ) -regret polynomial-time online learning algorithm guaranteeing that the overall cost (connection + moving) is at most O (log n ) times the time-averaged connection cost of the best fixed solution.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work we consider an online learning problem, called Online k -Clustering with Moving Costs , at which a learner maintains a set of k facilities over T rounds so as to minimize the connection cost of an adversarially selected sequence of clients. The learner is informed on the positions of the clients at each round t only after its facility-selection and can use this information to update its decision in the next round. However, updating the facility positions comes with an additional moving cost based on the moving distance of the facilities. We present the first O (log n ) -regret polynomial-time online learning algorithm guaranteeing that the overall cost (connection + moving) is at most O (log n ) times the time-averaged connection cost of the best fixed solution . Our work improves on the recent result of Fotakis et al.

ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering mechanisms*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized routing*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 7.

By leveraging JAX's auto-vectorization and parallelization over accelerators, Pgx can efficiently scale to thousands of simultaneous simulations over accelerators.

Pgx includes RL environments commonly used as benchmarks in RL research, such as backgammon, chess, shogi, and Go. Additionally, Pgx offers miniature game sets and baseline models to facilitate rapid research cycles. We demonstrate the efficient training of the Gumbel AlphaZero algorithm with Pgx environments. Overall, Pgx provides high-performance environment simulators for researchers to accelerate their RL experiments.

Quantum Policy Gradient Algorithm with Optimized Action Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized routing*\n\n*Nico Meyer, D. D. Scherer, A. Plinge, Christopher Mutschler, M. Hartmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a specific action decoding procedure for a quantum policy gradient approach that introduces only negligible classical overhead and has the potential to improve VQC-based algorithms beyond the field of quantum reinforcement learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Quantum machine learning implemented by variational quantum circuits (VQCs) is considered a promising concept for the noisy intermediate-scale quantum computing era. Focusing on applications in quantum reinforcement learning, we propose a specific action decoding procedure for a quantum policy gradient approach. We introduce a novel quality measure that enables us to optimize the classical post-processing required for action selection, inspired by local and global quantum measurements. The resulting algorithm demonstrates a significant performance improvement in several benchmark environments. With this technique, we successfully execute a full training routine on a 5-qubit hardware device.

Flow-Guided Sparse Transformer for Video Deblurring\n\n*From Search Query: flow-based sparse attention*\n\n*Luc van Gool, Radu Timofte, Yulun Zhang, Henghui Ding, Xueyi Zou, Youliang Yan, Haoqian Wang, Xiaowan Hu, Yuanhao Cai, Jing Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Exploiting similar and sharper scene patches in spatio-temporal neighborhoods is critical for video deblurring. However, CNN-based methods show limitations in capturing long-range dependencies and modeling non-local self-similarity. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Flow-Guided Sparse Transformer (FGST), for video deblurring. In FGST, we customize a self-attention module, Flow-Guided Sparse Window-based Multi-head Self-Attention (FGSW-MSA). For each $query$ element on the blurry reference frame, FGSW-MSA enjoys the guidance of the estimated optical flow to globally sample spatially sparse yet highly related $key$ elements corresponding to the same scene patch in neighboring frames. Besides, we present a Recurrent Embedding (RE) mechanism to transfer information from past frames and strengthen long-range temporal dependencies. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed FGST outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both DVD and GOPRO datasets and even yields more visually pleasing results in real video deblurring.

Long-term Frame-Event Visual Tracking: Benchmark Dataset and Baseline\n\n*From Search Query: flow-based sparse attention*\n\n*Bin Luo, Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, Bo Jiang, Chuanming Tang, Shiao Wang, Ju Huang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Current event-/frame-event based trackers undergo evaluation on short-term tracking datasets, however, the tracking of real-world scenarios involves long-term tracking, and the performance of existing tracking algorithms in these scenarios remains unclear. In this paper, we first propose a new long-term and large-scale frame-event single object tracking dataset, termed FELT. It contains 742 videos and 1,594,474 RGB frames and event stream pairs and has become the largest frame-event tracking dataset to date. We re-train and evaluate 15 baseline trackers on our dataset for future works to compare. More importantly, we find that the RGB frames and event streams are naturally incomplete due to the influence of challenging factors and spatially sparse event flow. In response to this, we propose a novel associative memory Transformer network as a unified backbone by introducing modern Hopfield layers into multi-head self-attention blocks to fuse both RGB and event data. Extensive experiments on RGB-Event (FELT), RGB-Thermal (RGBT234, LasHeR), and RGB-Depth (DepthTrack) datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our model.

Full Scaling Automation for Sustainable Development of Green Data Centers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering mechanisms*\n\n*Jian Liu, Yifei Zheng, James Zhang, Lin-Tao Ma, Shiyi Zhu, Xiaoming Shi, Yinbo Sun, Shiyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The rapid rise in cloud computing has resulted in an alarming increase in data centers' carbon emissions, which now accounts for >3% of global greenhouse gas emissions, necessitating immediate steps to combat their mounting strain on the global climate. An important focus of this effort is to improve resource utilization in order to save electricity usage. Our proposed Full Scaling Automation (FSA) mechanism is an effective method of dynamically adapting resources to accommodate changing workloads in large-scale cloud computing clusters, enabling the clusters in data centers to maintain their desired CPU utilization target and thus improve energy efficiency. FSA harnesses the power of deep representation learning to accurately predict the future workload of each service and automatically stabilize the corresponding target CPU usage level, unlike the previous autoscaling methods, such as Autopilot or FIRM, that need to adjust computing resources with statistical models and expert knowledge. Our approach achieves significant performance improvement compared to the existing work in real-world datasets. We also deployed FSA on large-scale cloud computing clusters in industrial data centers, and according to the certification of the China Environmental United Certification Center (CEC), a reduction of 947 tons of carbon dioxide, equivalent to a saving of 1538,000 kWh of electricity, was achieved during the Double 11 shopping festival of 2022, marking a critical step for our company's strategic goal towards carbon neutrality by 2030.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Unsupervised Learning of Visual Features by Contrasting Cluster Assignments\n\n*From Search Query: efficient clustering mechanisms*\n\n*Priya Goyal, Julien Mairal, Armand Joulin, Piotr Bojanowski, Mathilde Caron, Ishan Misra*\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised image representations have significantly reduced the gap with supervised pretraining, notably with the recent achievements of contrastive learning methods. These contrastive methods typically work online and rely on a large number of explicit pairwise feature comparisons, which is computationally challenging. In this paper, we propose an online algorithm, SwAV, that takes advantage of contrastive methods without requiring to compute pairwise comparisons. Specifically, our method simultaneously clusters the data while enforcing consistency between cluster assignments produced for different augmentations (or views) of the same image, instead of comparing features directly as in contrastive learning. Simply put, we use a swapped prediction mechanism where we predict the cluster assignment of a view from the representation of another view. Our method can be trained with large and small batches and can scale to unlimited amounts of data. Compared to previous contrastive methods, our method is more memory efficient since it does not require a large memory bank or a special momentum network. In addition, we also propose a new data augmentation strategy, multi-crop, that uses a mix of views with different resolutions in place of two full-resolution views, without increasing the memory or compute requirements much. We validate our findings by achieving 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with ResNet-50, as well as surpassing supervised pretraining on all the considered transfer tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-17\n\n\n\n#### 5. MegaBlocks: Efficient Sparse Training with Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized routing*\n\n*Matei Zaharia, Cliff Young, Deepak Narayanan, Trevor Gale*\n\n**Abstract:** We present MegaBlocks, a system for efficient Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) training on GPUs. Our system is motivated by the limitations of current frameworks, which restrict the dynamic routing in MoE layers to satisfy the constraints of existing software and hardware. These formulations force a tradeoff between model quality and hardware efficiency, as users must choose between dropping tokens from the computation or wasting computation and memory on padding. To address these limitations, we reformulate MoE computation in terms of block-sparse operations and develop new block-sparse GPU kernels that efficiently handle the dynamism present in MoEs. Our approach never drops tokens and maps efficiently to modern hardware, enabling end-to-end training speedups of up to 40% over MoEs trained with the state-of-the-art Tutel library and 2.4x over DNNs trained with the highly-optimized Megatron-LM framework.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. DS-Net++: Dynamic Weight Slicing for Efficient Inference in CNNs and Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-optimized routing*\n\n*Xiaojun Chang, Zhihui Li, Xiaodan Liang, Bing Wang, Guangrun Wang, Changlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamic networks have shown their promising capability in reducing theoretical computation complexity by adapting their architectures to the input during inference. However, their practical runtime usually lags behind the theoretical acceleration due to inefficient sparsity. Here, we explore a hardware-efficient dynamic inference regime, named dynamic weight slicing, which adaptively slice a part of network parameters for inputs with diverse difficulty levels, while keeping parameters stored statically and contiguously in hardware to prevent the extra burden of sparse computation. Based on this scheme, we present dynamic slimmable network (DS-Net) and dynamic slice-able network (DS-Net++) by input-dependently adjusting filter numbers of CNNs and multiple dimensions in both CNNs and transformers, respectively. To ensure sub-network generality and routing fairness, we propose a disentangled two-stage optimization scheme with training techniques such as in-place bootstrapping (IB), multi-view consistency (MvCo) and sandwich gate sparsification (SGS) to train supernet and gate separately. Extensive experiments on 4 datasets and 3 different network architectures demonstrate our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art static and dynamic model compression methods by a large margin (up to 6.6%). Typically, DS-Net++ achieves 2-4x computation reduction and 1.62x real-world acceleration over MobileNet, ResNet-50 and Vision Transformer, with minimal accuracy drops (0.1-0.3%) on ImageNet.

They optimize memory bandwidth usage and leverage parallel processing capabilities, making them particularly effective for practical performance[Analysis Note].\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Content-Based Sparse Attention**:\n  Learning dynamic sparse attention patterns based on content rather than fixed patterns can enhance efficiency. This approach combines the flexibility of content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from local, temporal sparse attention[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Flow Conservation Principles**:\n  Using flow network theory to structure attention can achieve linear complexity while maintaining expressiveness. This approach naturally incorporates competition mechanisms through flow conservation, which can be highly efficient[Analysis Note].\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Algorithms**:\n  Efficient algorithms for sparse computation, such as those used in SAMSA and SeerAttention, are crucial for reducing memory bandwidth usage and optimizing performance. These algorithms ensure that sparse operations are performed efficiently without significant overhead.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can design a novel autoregressive LM block that leverages flow-based sparse attention, efficient clustering mechanisms, and hardware-optimized routing. This approach can lead to improved efficiency, scalability, and performance in language modeling tasks.\n",

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/94 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nWe provide implementation details in App. D. ## 3 Theoretical Results about Sparse Attention Mechanism\n\nIn this section, we will show that that sparse attention mechanisms are as powerful and expressive as full-attention mechanisms in two respects.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5. Sparse and continuous attention mechanisms (Avg. Score: 0.52)\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/36 (Score: 0.52)*\n\n```\n# Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms \n\nAndr\u00e9 F.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: differentiable sparsity mechanisms, flow attention variants, memory optimization techniques\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Commonly, rationales are modeled as stochastic binary masks, requiring sampling-based gradient estimators, which complicates training and requires careful hyperparameter tuning. Sparse attention mechanisms are a deterministic alternative, but they lack a way to regularize the rationale extraction (e.g., to control the sparsity of a text highlight or the number of alignments). In this paper, we present a unified framework for deterministic extraction of structured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a differentiable layer. Our approach greatly eases training and rationale regularization, generally outperforming previous work on what comes to performance and plausibility of the extracted rationales.

Spartan: Differentiable Sparsity via Regularized Transportation\n\n*From Search Query: differentiable sparsity mechanisms*\n\n*Kai Sheng Tai, Taipeng Tian, S. Lim*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Spartan, a method for training sparse neural network models with a predetermined level of sparsity. Spartan is based on a combination of two techniques: (1) soft top-k masking of low-magnitude parameters via a regularized optimal transportation problem and (2) dual averaging-based parameter updates with hard sparsification in the forward pass. This scheme realizes an exploration-exploitation tradeoff: early in training, the learner is able to explore various sparsity patterns, and as the soft top-k approximation is gradually sharpened over the course of training, the balance shifts towards parameter optimization with respect to a fixed sparsity mask. Spartan is sufficiently flexible to accommodate a variety of sparsity allocation policies, including both unstructured and block structured sparsity, as well as general cost-sensitive sparsity allocation mediated by linear models of per-parameter costs. On ImageNet-1K classification, Spartan yields 95% sparse ResNet-50 models and 90% block sparse ViT-B/16 models while incurring absolute top-1 accuracy losses of less than 1% compared to fully dense training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

This is a notoriously hard problem to solve, which has recently been addressed with machine learning, in particular graph neural networks (GNN) and variants trained and evaluated on datasets of static objects in static scenes with fixed geometry. We attempt to go beyond existing work in complexity and introduce a new model, method and benchmark. We propose EAGLE, a large-scale dataset of 1.1 million 2D meshes resulting from simulations of unsteady fluid dynamics caused by a moving flow source interacting with nonlinear scene structure, comprised of 600 different scenes of three different types. To perform future forecasting of pressure and velocity on the challenging EAGLE dataset, we introduce a new mesh transformer. It leverages node clustering, graph pooling and global attention to learn long-range dependencies between spatially distant data points without needing a large number of iterations, as existing GNN methods do. We show that our transformer outperforms state-of-the-art performance on, both, existing synthetic and real datasets and on EAGLE. Finally, we highlight that our approach learns to attend to airflow, integrating complex information in a single iteration.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network for 3D Mask Detection\n\n*From Search Query: flow attention variants*\n\n*Yuxin Cao, Yian Li, Yumeng Zhu, Derui Wang, Minhui Xue*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel 3D mask detection framework, called FASTEN (Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal aggrEgation Network), which can eliminate redundant spatio-temporal feature interference and quickly capture splicing traces of 3D masks in fewer frames.\n\n**Abstract:** Anti-spoofing detection has become a necessity for face recognition systems due to the security threat posed by spoofing attacks. Despite great success in traditional attacks, most deep-learning-based methods perform poorly in 3D masks, which can highly simulate real faces in appearance and structure, suffering generalizability insufficiency while focusing only on the spatial domain with single frame input. This has been mitigated by the recent introduction of a biomedical technology called rPPG (remote photoplethysmography). However, rPPG-based methods are sensitive to noisy interference and require at least one second (>25 frames) of observation time, which induces high computational overhead. To address these challenges, we propose a novel 3D mask detection framework, called FASTEN (Flow-Attention-based Spatio-Temporal aggrEgation Network). We tailor the network for focusing more on fine-grained details in large movements, which can eliminate redundant spatio-temporal feature interference and quickly capture splicing traces of 3D masks in fewer frames. Our proposed network contains three key modules: 1) a facial optical flow network to obtain non-RGB inter-frame flow information; 2) flow attention to assign different significance to each frame; 3) spatio-temporal aggregation to aggregate high-level spatial features and temporal transition features. Through extensive experiments, FASTEN only requires five frames of input and outperforms eight competitors for both intra-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations in terms of multiple detection metrics. Moreover, FASTEN has been deployed in real-world mobile devices for practical 3D mask detection.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

A major challenge in this task is to ensure that all frames in the edited video are visually consistent. Most recent works apply advanced text-to-image diffusion models to this task by inflating 2D spatial attention in the U-Net into spatio-temporal attention. Although temporal context can be added through spatio-temporal attention, it may introduce some irrelevant information for each patch and therefore cause inconsistency in the edited video. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce optical flow into the attention module in the diffusion model's U-Net to address the inconsistency issue for text-to-video editing. Our method, FLATTEN, enforces the patches on the same flow path across different frames to attend to each other in the attention module, thus improving the visual consistency in the edited videos. Additionally, our method is training-free and can be seamlessly integrated into any diffusion-based text-to-video editing methods and improve their visual consistency.

Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 242  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 7. Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization techniques*\n\n*Yihua Zhang, Pingzhi Li, Junyuan Hong, Jiaxiang Li, Yimeng Zhang, Wenqing Zheng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jason D.

Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Ponomareva, Zhe Zhao, R. Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint, and extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework, CHITA, which leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Adaptively Sparse Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: differentiable sparsity mechanisms*\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins, Gon\u00e7alo M. Correia, Vlad Niculae*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become ubiquitous in NLP. Recent architectures, notably the Transformer, learn powerful context-aware word representations through layered, multi-headed attention. The multiple heads learn diverse types of word relationships. However, with standard softmax attention, all attention heads are dense, assigning a non-zero weight to all context words. In this work, we introduce the adaptively sparse Transformer, wherein attention heads have flexible, context-dependent sparsity patterns. This sparsity is accomplished by replacing softmax with $\\alpha$-entmax: a differentiable generalization of softmax that allows low-scoring words to receive precisely zero weight. Moreover, we derive a method to automatically learn the $\\alpha$ parameter -- which controls the shape and sparsity of $\\alpha$-entmax -- allowing attention heads to choose between focused or spread-out behavior. Our adaptively sparse Transformer improves interpretability and head diversity when compared to softmax Transformers on machine translation datasets. Findings of the quantitative and qualitative analysis of our approach include that heads in different layers learn different sparsity preferences and tend to be more diverse in their attention distributions than softmax Transformers. Furthermore, at no cost in accuracy, sparsity in attention heads helps to uncover different head specializations.\n\n**Conference:** adaptively-sparse-transformers-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Long-Term Time-Series Forecasting: Feature, Pattern, and Distribution\n\n*From Search Query: differentiable sparsity mechanisms*\n\n*Dejing Dou, Bo Jin, Jiantao Su, Jian Tang, Haoyi Xiong, Xinjiang Lu, Yan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Long-term time-series forecasting (LTTF) has become a pressing demand in many applications, such as wind power supply planning. Transformer models have been adopted to deliver high prediction capacity because of the high computational self-attention mechanism. Though one could lower the complexity of Transformers by inducing the sparsity in point-wise self-attentions for LTTF, the limited information utilization prohibits the model from exploring the complex dependencies comprehensively. To this end, we propose an efficient Transformerbased model, named Conformer, which differentiates itself from existing methods for LTTF in three aspects: (i) an encoder-decoder architecture incorporating a linear complexity without sacrificing information utilization is proposed on top of sliding-window attention and Stationary and Instant Recurrent Network (SIRN); (ii) a module derived from the normalizing flow is devised to further improve the information utilization by inferring the outputs with the latent variables in SIRN directly; (iii) the inter-series correlation and temporal dynamics in time-series data are modeled explicitly to fuel the downstream self-attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on seven real-world datasets demonstrate that Conformer outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on LTTF and generates reliable prediction results with uncertainty quantification.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-05\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning to Execute Programs with Instruction Pointer Attention Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: flow attention variants*\n\n*Daniel Tarlow, Hugo Larochelle, Charles Sutton, David Bieber*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for learning software engineering tasks including code completion, bug finding, and program repair. They benefit from leveraging program structure like control flow graphs, but they are not well-suited to tasks like program execution that require far more sequential reasoning steps than number of GNN propagation steps. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), on the other hand, are well-suited to long sequential chains of reasoning, but they do not naturally incorporate program structure and generally perform worse on the above tasks. Our aim is to achieve the best of both worlds, and we do so by introducing a novel GNN architecture, the Instruction Pointer Attention Graph Neural Networks (IPA-GNN), which achieves improved systematic generalization on the task of learning to execute programs using control flow graphs. The model arises by considering RNNs operating on program traces with branch decisions as latent variables. The IPA-GNN can be seen either as a continuous relaxation of the RNN model or as a GNN variant more tailored to execution. To test the models, we propose evaluating systematic generalization on learning to execute using control flow graphs, which tests sequential reasoning and use of program structure. More practically, we evaluate these models on the task of learning to execute partial programs, as might arise if using the model as a heuristic function in program synthesis. Results show that the IPA-GNN outperforms a variety of RNN and GNN baselines on both tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n#### 4. Segmentation-Aware Convolutional Networks Using Local Attention Masks\n\n*From Search Query: flow attention variants*\n\n*Adam W. Harley, Konstantinos G. Derpanis, Iasonas Kokkinos*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce an approach to integrate segmentation information within a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN). This counter-acts the tendency of CNNs to\nsmooth information across regions and increases their spatial precision. To\nobtain segmentation information, we set up a CNN to provide an embedding space\nwhere region co-membership can be estimated based on Euclidean distance. We use\nthese embeddings to compute a local attention mask relative to every neuron\nposition. We incorporate such masks in CNNs and replace the convolution\noperation with a \"segmentation-aware\" variant that allows a neuron to\nselectively attend to inputs coming from its own region. We call the resulting\nnetwork a segmentation-aware CNN because it adapts its filters at each image\npoint according to local segmentation cues. We demonstrate the merit of our\nmethod on two widely different dense prediction tasks, that involve\nclassification (semantic segmentation) and regression (optical flow). Our\nresults show that in semantic segmentation we can match the performance of\nDenseCRFs while being faster and simpler, and in optical flow we obtain clearly\nsharper responses than networks that do not use local attention masks. In both\ncases, segmentation-aware convolution yields systematic improvements over\nstrong baselines.

Despite the remarkable progress made in the field of machine learning systems research, which has enabled the development and exploration of large models, such abilities remain confined to a small group of advanced users and industry leaders, resulting in an implicit technical barrier for the wider community to access and leverage these technologies. In this paper, we introduce PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as an industry-grade solution for large model training. FSDP has been closely co-designed with several key PyTorch core components including Tensor implementation, dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to provide non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency. Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to optimize resource utilization across a variety of hardware configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSDP is capable of achieving comparable performance to Distributed Data Parallel while providing support for significantly larger models with near-linear scalability in terms of TFLOPS.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. Elixir: Train a Large Language Model on a Small GPU Cluster\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization techniques*\n\n*Yang You, Shenggui Li, Hongxin Liu, Jiarui Fang, Haichen Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, large language models have achieved great success due to their unprecedented size. However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models. The beta version of Elixir is now available at https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/feature/elixir.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on differentiable sparsity mechanisms, flow-based attention variants, and memory optimization techniques is crucial. Here are some key findings and implementations from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Differentiable Sparsity Mechanisms in Attention\n\n1. **ReLU Attention and HSR Data Structure**:\n   The paper on \"HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention Acceleration\" introduces a method using the ReLU activation function instead of the traditional softmax for attention computation. This approach utilizes the half-space reporting (HSR) data structure to reduce the computational time complexity of attention mechanisms. It provides rigorous proofs for reducing the computational time for both ReLU and softmax attention, making it more efficient without incurring significant approximation errors.\n\n2. **Differential Attention Mechanism**:\n   The Differential Transformer (Diff Transformer) uses a differential attention mechanism that calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. This method helps in canceling out noise and amplifying attention to the most relevant parts of the input, which is a form of dynamic sparsity. It maintains efficiency through parallelization and optimization techniques, making it a viable option for differentiable sparsity.\n\n## Flow-Based Attention Variants and Their Properties\n\n1. **SAMSA: Sampling-Self-Attention**:\n   The SAMSA (SAMpling-Self-Attention) mechanism is a context-aware linear complexity self-attention method that works well on multiple data modalities. It uses a differentiable sampling without replacement method to attend to the most important token set, defined by the data. This approach is efficient in inference and reduces computational costs, making it a promising flow-based attention variant.\n\n2. **Flow Conservation Principles**:\n   While not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources, flow conservation principles can be integrated into attention mechanisms by ensuring that the attention weights are normalized and conserved across different parts of the input. This can be achieved through mechanisms like the differential attention in Diff Transformer, which inherently promotes sparse attention patterns by subtracting noise.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques for Sparse Computation\n\n1. **Sparse Sequence-to-Sequence Models**:\n   Sparse sequence-to-sequence models, such as the Sparse Transformer, reduce computational complexity from \\(O(n^2)\\) to \\(O(n\\sqrt{n})\\) by applying sparse factorizations to self-attention matrices. This approach minimizes memory footprint by storing only non-zero elements and optimizes operations to skip zero elements, leading to faster computation times.\n\n2. **HSR Data Structure and ReLU Attention**:\n   The use of the HSR data structure in conjunction with ReLU attention helps in reducing the running time complexity of attention computation. This method ensures that only significant entries are considered, which reduces memory usage and computational overhead.\n\n3. **Efficient KV Pair Selection**:\n   The Differential Transformer and other sparse attention mechanisms emphasize efficient KV pair selection. By focusing on the most relevant KV pairs and using techniques like differential attention, these models can achieve a constant memory footprint during generation, which is crucial for memory optimization.\n\n## Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Dynamic Sparsity**: Mechanisms like the Differential Transformer and ReLU attention with HSR data structure enable dynamic sparsity, which is essential for maintaining expressiveness while reducing computation.\n- **Flow-Based Attention**: SAMSA and similar mechanisms provide efficient and context-aware attention that can be integrated into various data modalities.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Techniques such as sparse factorizations, HSR data structures, and efficient KV pair selection are critical for reducing memory footprint and optimizing computational efficiency.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and robust, aligning with the goal of improving overall performance.\n",

The primary goal is to improve adaptability, expressiveness, and computational efficiency in autoregressive language models. \n\n   After reviewing the latest search results, it has become evident that:\n\n   - There is significant overlap between GMLA and existing models that integrate gating mechanisms and meta-learning into attention mechanisms.\n   - Several models, such as **Gated Linear Attention Transformers (GLAT)**, **MEGA (Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention)**, and **Hedgehog Linear Attention**, have already explored similar concepts.\n   - Previous internal proposals with analogous ideas have received low ratings due to lack of originality, suggesting that the novelty of GMLA may be insufficient without distinct innovations.\n   \n   The key challenge is to assess whether GMLA offers unique contributions that differentiate it from existing models and whether it addresses limitations not yet resolved by current research.\n\n2. **All Useful References with Excerpts**\n\n   - **Yang et al.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Score: 0.98)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv:2405.15793, 2024.

Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nDesigning a single unified model to capture long range dependencies in sequential data across a diverge range of modalities, such as language, audio, image and video, is a central and challenging problem in sequence modeling. A number of different archtectures have been developed, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) (Kim, 2014; Strubell et al., 2017), recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (Goller and Kuchler, 1996; Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Cho et al., 2014), Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recent state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022a; Mehta et al., 2022).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error, measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments. We show that various types of memory-based neural models, including Transformers, LSTMs, and RNNs can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

We argue that these capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chen Huang, Walter A. Talbott, N. Jaitly, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, this paper learns to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer, and makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise attention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7.

BiSHop: Bi-Directional Cellular Learning for Tabular Data with Generalized Sparse Modern Hopfield Model\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chenwei Xu, Yu-Chao Huang, Jerry Yao-Chieh Hu, Weijian Li, Ammar Gilani, H. Goan, Han Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The BiSHop framework, a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning, is introduced, demonstrating that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the \\textbf{B}i-Directional \\textbf{S}parse \\textbf{Hop}field Network (\\textbf{BiSHop}), a novel end-to-end framework for deep tabular learning. BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: Gated linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Towards Resilient and Efficient LLMs: A Comparative Study of Efficiency,\n  Performance, and Adversarial Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: Gated linear attention*\n\n*Xiaojing Fan, Chunliang Tao*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increasing demand for practical applications of Large Language\nModels (LLMs), many attention-efficient models have been developed to balance\nperformance and computational cost. However, the adversarial robustness of\nthese models remains under-explored. In this work, we design a framework to\ninvestigate the trade-off between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness of LLMs and conduct extensive experiments on three prominent models\nwith varying levels of complexity and efficiency -- Transformer++, Gated Linear\nAttention (GLA) Transformer, and MatMul-Free LM -- utilizing the GLUE and\nAdvGLUE datasets. The AdvGLUE dataset extends the GLUE dataset with adversarial\nsamples designed to challenge model robustness. Our results show that while the\nGLA Transformer and MatMul-Free LM achieve slightly lower accuracy on GLUE\ntasks, they demonstrate higher efficiency and either superior or comparative\nrobustness on AdvGLUE tasks compared to Transformer++ across different attack\nlevels. These findings highlight the potential of simplified architectures to\nachieve a compelling balance between efficiency, performance, and adversarial\nrobustness, offering valuable insights for applications where resource\nconstraints and resilience to adversarial attacks are critical.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-08T16:54:40Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-14T03:19:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Explain and Improve: LRP-Inference Fine-Tuning for Image Captioning\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamei Sun, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the predictions of image captioning models with attention\nmechanisms beyond visualizing the attention itself. We develop variants of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and gradient-based explanation methods,\ntailored to image captioning models with attention mechanisms. We compare the\ninterpretability of attention heatmaps systematically against the explanations\nprovided by explanation methods such as LRP, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM. We\nshow that explanation methods provide simultaneously pixel-wise image\nexplanations (supporting and opposing pixels of the input image) and linguistic\nexplanations (supporting and opposing words of the preceding sequence) for each\nword in the predicted captions. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that\nexplanation methods 1) can reveal additional evidence used by the model to make\ndecisions compared to attention; 2) correlate to object locations with high\nprecision; 3) are helpful to \"debug\" the model, e.g. by analyzing the reasons\nfor hallucinated object words. With the observed properties of explanations, we\nfurther design an LRP-inference fine-tuning strategy that reduces the issue of\nobject hallucination in image captioning models, and meanwhile, maintains the\nsentence fluency. We conduct experiments with two widely used attention\nmechanisms: the adaptive attention mechanism calculated with the additive\nattention and the multi-head attention mechanism calculated with the scaled dot\nproduct.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-04T05:15:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-08-01T06:27:04Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Density Adaptive Attention is All You Need: Robust Parameter-Efficient\n  Fine-Tuning Across Multiple Modalities\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Georgios Ioannides, Aman Chadha, Aaron Elkins*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose the Multi-Head Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM), a\nnovel probabilistic attention framework that can be used for\nParameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT), and the Density Adaptive Transformer\n(DAT), designed to enhance information aggregation across multiple modalities,\nincluding Speech, Text, and Vision.

Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Gated linear attention*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via $\\operatorname{softmax}$, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the $\\operatorname{softmax}$ operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-learning transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. AOE-Net: Entities Interactions Modeling with Adaptive Attention Mechanism for Temporal Action Proposals Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ngan Le, Minh-Triet Tran, Bhiksha Raj, Kashu Yamazaki, Sang Truong, Khoa Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task, which requires localizing action intervals in an untrimmed video. Intuitively, we as humans, perceive an action through the interactions between actors, relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Despite the significant progress of TAPG, a vast majority of existing methods ignore the aforementioned principle of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e., perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100).

Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 4. Can Mamba Learn How to Learn?

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 21 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"meta-learning linear attention\", \"adaptive gating transformers\", \"learnable attention mechanisms\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates.

Meta-Learning for Relative Density-Ratio Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata, Y. Fujiwara*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets, and model the relative densities by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution.\n\n**Abstract:** The ratio of two probability densities, called a density-ratio, is a vital quantity in machine learning. In particular, a relative density-ratio, which is a bounded extension of the density-ratio, has received much attention due to its stability and has been used in various applications such as outlier detection and dataset comparison. Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio estimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However, sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets. Specifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model extracts the datasets' information by using neural networks and uses it to obtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the relative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form solution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its differentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test error for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few instances. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using three problems: relative DRE, dataset comparison, and outlier detection.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Attentional Meta-learners for Few-shot Polythetic Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Ben Day, Ram\u00f3n Vi\u00f1as Torn\u00e9, Nikola Simidjievski, Pietro Lio'*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a self-attention feature-selection mechanism that adaptively dilutes non-discriminative features in the presence of task-irrelevant features and demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach in meta-learning Boolean functions, and synthetic and real-world few-shot learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Polythetic classifications, based on shared patterns of features that need neither be universal nor constant among members of a class, are common in the natural world and greatly outnumber monothetic classifications over a set of features. We show that threshold meta-learners, such as Prototypical Networks, require an embedding dimension that is exponential in the number of task-relevant features to emulate these functions. In contrast, attentional classifiers, such as Matching Networks, are polythetic by default and able to solve these problems with a linear embedding dimension. However, we find that in the presence of task-irrelevant features, inherent to meta-learning problems, attentional models are susceptible to misclassification. To address this challenge, we propose a self-attention feature-selection mechanism that adaptively dilutes non-discriminative features. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in meta-learning Boolean functions, and synthetic and real-world few-shot learning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect errors on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite progress across a broad range of applications, Transformers have limited success in systematic generalization. The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing.

Adaptive Gating in Mixture-of-Experts based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating transformers\"*\n\n*Jiamin Li, Qiang Su, Yitao Yang, Yimin Jiang, Cong Wang, Hong-Yu Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive gating in MoE is introduced, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution that preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have demonstrated exceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for scaling models while maintaining a constant number of computational operations. Existing MoE model adopts a fixed gating network where each token is computed by the same number of experts. However, this approach contradicts our intuition that the tokens in each sequence vary in terms of their linguistic complexity and, consequently, require different computational costs. Little is discussed in prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model performance. This paper introduces adaptive gating in MoE, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution. The proposed framework preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency. Additionally, curriculum learning is leveraged to further reduce training time. Extensive experiments on diverse NLP tasks show that adaptive gating reduces at most 22.5% training time while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the routing decisions and present our insights when adaptive gating is used.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Gating Dropout: Communication-efficient Regularization for Sparsely Activated Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"adaptive gating transformers\"*\n\n*R. Liu, Young Jin Kim, Alexandre Muzio, Barzan Mozafari, H. Awadalla*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Gating Dropout, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their local machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication and improves a state-of-the-art MoE model with faster wall-clock time convergence rates and better BLEU scores for a variety of model sizes and datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely activated transformers, such as Mixture of Experts (MoE), have received great interest due to their outrageous scaling capability which enables dramatical increases in model size without significant increases in computational cost. To achieve this, MoE models replace the feedforward sub-layer with Mixture-of-Experts sub-layer in transformers and use a gating network to route each token to its assigned experts. Since the common practice for efficient training of such models requires distributing experts and tokens across different machines, this routing strategy often incurs huge cross-machine communication cost because tokens and their assigned experts likely reside in different machines. In this paper, we propose \\emph{Gating Dropout}, which allows tokens to ignore the gating network and stay at their local machines, thus reducing the cross-machine communication. Similar to traditional dropout, we also show that Gating Dropout has a regularization effect during training, resulting in improved generalization performance. We validate the effectiveness of Gating Dropout on multilingual machine translation tasks. Our results demonstrate that Gating Dropout improves a state-of-the-art MoE model with faster wall-clock time convergence rates and better BLEU scores for a variety of model sizes and datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Learnable Fourier Features for Multi-Dimensional Spatial Positional Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Yang Li, Si Si, Gang Li, Cho-Jui Hsieh, Samy Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel positional encoding method based on learnable Fourier features that represents each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable encoding based onlearnable Fouriers feature mapping, modulated with a multi-layer perceptron.\n\n**Abstract:** Attentional mechanisms are order-invariant. Positional encoding is a crucial component to allow attention-based deep model architectures such as Transformer to address sequences or images where the position of information matters. In this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding method based on learnable Fourier features. Instead of hard-coding each position as a token or a vector, we represent each position, which can be multi-dimensional, as a trainable encoding based on learnable Fourier feature mapping, modulated with a multi-layer perceptron. The representation is particularly advantageous for a spatial multi-dimensional position, e.g., pixel positions on an image, where $L_2$ distances or more complex positional relationships need to be captured. Our experiments based on several public benchmark tasks show that our learnable Fourier feature representation for multi-dimensional positional encoding outperforms existing methods by both improving the accuracy and allowing faster convergence.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 8.

While the machine learning community's interest in associative memories has recently been rekindled, most work has focused on memory recall ($read$) over memory learning ($write$). In this paper, we present BayesPCN, a hierarchical associative memory capable of performing continual one-shot memory writes without meta-learning. Moreover, BayesPCN is able to gradually forget past observations ($forget$) to free its memory. Experiments show that BayesPCN can recall corrupted i.i.d. high-dimensional data observed hundreds to a thousand ``timesteps'' ago without a large drop in recall ability compared to the state-of-the-art offline-learned parametric memory models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9. BasisFormer: Attention-based Time Series Forecasting with Learnable and Interpretable Basis\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Zelin Ni, Hang Yu, Shizhan Liu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed BasisFormer is an end-to-end time series forecasting architecture that leverages learnable and interpretable bases and outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 11.04 and 15.78% respectively for univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Bases have become an integral part of modern deep learning-based models for time series forecasting due to their ability to act as feature extractors or future references. To be effective, a basis must be tailored to the specific set of time series data and exhibit distinct correlation with each time series within the set. However, current state-of-the-art methods are limited in their ability to satisfy both of these requirements simultaneously. To address this challenge, we propose BasisFormer, an end-to-end time series forecasting architecture that leverages learnable and interpretable bases. This architecture comprises three components: First, we acquire bases through adaptive self-supervised learning, which treats the historical and future sections of the time series as two distinct views and employs contrastive learning. Next, we design a Coef module that calculates the similarity coefficients between the time series and bases in the historical view via bidirectional cross-attention. Finally, we present a Forecast module that selects and consolidates the bases in the future view based on the similarity coefficients, resulting in accurate future predictions. Through extensive experiments on six datasets, we demonstrate that BasisFormer outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by 11.04\\% and 15.78\\% respectively for univariate and multivariate forecasting tasks.

The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive\n  Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aurelien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard\nto scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their\ncomputational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs\nof tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we\npresent a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while\npreserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and\ncomputational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable\nmechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the\ncontext at any point across the generation process.

Smart Bird: Learnable Sparse Attention for Efficient and Effective\n  Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Chuhan Wu, Fangzhao Wu, Tao Qi, Binxing Jiao, Daxin Jiang, Yongfeng Huang, Xing Xie*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has achieved great success in NLP. However, the quadratic\ncomplexity of the self-attention mechanism in Transformer makes it inefficient\nin handling long sequences. Many existing works explore to accelerate\nTransformers by computing sparse self-attention instead of a dense one, which\nusually attends to tokens at certain positions or randomly selected tokens.\nHowever, manually selected or random tokens may be uninformative for context\nmodeling.

Transformers learn in-context by gradient descent\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Max Vladymyrov, Andrey Zhmoginov, Alexander Mordvintsev, Jo\u00e3o Sacramento, Ettore Randazzo, Eyvind Niklasson, Johannes von Oswald*\n\n**Abstract:** At present, the mechanisms of in-context learning in Transformers are not well understood and remain mostly an intuition. In this paper, we suggest that training Transformers on auto-regressive objectives is closely related to gradient-based meta-learning formulations. We start by providing a simple weight construction that shows the equivalence of data transformations induced by 1) a single linear self-attention layer and by 2) gradient-descent (GD) on a regression loss. Motivated by that construction, we show empirically that when training self-attention-only Transformers on simple regression tasks either the models learned by GD and Transformers show great similarity or, remarkably, the weights found by optimization match the construction. Thus we show how trained Transformers become mesa-optimizers i.e. learn models by gradient descent in their forward pass. This allows us, at least in the domain of regression problems, to mechanistically understand the inner workings of in-context learning in optimized Transformers. Building on this insight, we furthermore identify how Transformers surpass the performance of plain gradient descent by learning an iterative curvature correction and learn linear models on deep data representations to solve non-linear regression tasks. Finally, we discuss intriguing parallels to a mechanism identified to be crucial for in-context learning termed induction-head (Olsson et al., 2022) and show how it could be understood as a specific case of in-context learning by gradient descent learning within Transformers.

Interpretable and Efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\"*\n\n*Jian-Xin Li, Quan Wang, Yaming Yang, Jiangtao Cui, Ziyu Guan, Wei Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) has achieved extraordinary success in learning effective task-specific representations of nodes in graphs. However, regarding Heterogeneous Information Network (HIN), existing HIN-oriented GCN methods still suffer from two deficiencies: (1) they cannot flexibly explore all possible meta-paths and extract the most useful ones for a target object, which hinders both effectiveness and interpretability; (2) they often need to generate intermediate meta-path based dense graphs, which leads to high computational complexity. To address the above issues, we propose an interpretable and efficient Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (ie-HGCN) to learn the representations of objects in HINs. It is designed as a hierarchical aggregation architecture, i.e., object-level aggregation first, followed by type-level aggregation. The novel architecture can automatically extract useful meta-paths for each object from all possible meta-paths (within a length limit), which brings good model interpretability. It can also reduce the computational cost by avoiding intermediate HIN transformation and neighborhood attention. We provide theoretical analysis about the proposed ie-HGCN in terms of evaluating the usefulness of all possible meta-paths, its connection to the spectral graph convolution on HINs, and its quasi-linear time complexity. Extensive experiments on three real network datasets demonstrate the superiority of ie-HGCN over the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach.

Existing works mainly focus on language and image instruction tuning, different from which, our ImageBind-LLM can respond to multi-modality conditions, including audio, 3D point clouds, video, and their embedding-space arithmetic by only image-text alignment training. During training, we adopt a learnable bind network to align the embedding space between LLaMA and ImageBind's image encoder. Then, the image features transformed by the bind network are added to word tokens of all layers in LLaMA, which progressively injects visual instructions via an attention-free and zero-initialized gating mechanism. Aided by the joint embedding of ImageBind, the simple image-text training enables our model to exhibit superior multi-modality instruction-following capabilities. During inference, the multi-modality inputs are fed into the corresponding ImageBind encoders, and processed by a proposed visual cache model for further cross-modal embedding enhancement. The training-free cache model retrieves from three million image features extracted by ImageBind, which effectively mitigates the training-inference modality discrepancy. Notably, with our approach, ImageBind-LLM can respond to instructions of diverse modalities and demonstrate significant language generation quality.

Learnable Multi-level Frequency Decomposition and Hierarchical Attention Mechanism for Generalized Face Presentation Attack Detection\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Arjan Kuijper, Florian Kirchbuchner, Naser Damer, Meiling Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** With the increased deployment of face recognition systems in our daily lives, face presentation attack detection (PAD) is attracting much attention and playing a key role in securing face recognition systems. Despite the great performance achieved by the hand-crafted and deep-learning-based methods in intra-dataset evaluations, the performance drops when dealing with unseen scenarios. In this work, we propose a dual-stream convolution neural networks (CNNs) framework. One stream adapts four learnable frequency filters to learn features in the frequency domain, which are less influenced by variations in sensors/illuminations. The other stream leverages the RGB images to complement the features of the frequency domain. Moreover, we propose a hierarchical attention module integration to join the information from the two streams at different stages by considering the nature of deep features in different layers of the CNN. The proposed method is evaluated in the intra-dataset and cross-dataset setups, and the results demonstrate that our proposed approach enhances the generalizability in most experimental setups in comparison to state-of-the-art, including the methods designed explicitly for domain adaption/shift problems. We successfully prove the design of our proposed PAD solution in a step-wise ablation study that involves our proposed learnable frequency decomposition, our hierarchical attention module design, and the used loss function.

Enhancing Few-Shot Image Classification through Learnable Multi-Scale Embedding and Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: \"learnable attention mechanisms\"*\n\n*Mohammad Reza Mohammadi, Amirreza Fateh, Fatemeh Askari*\n\n**Abstract:** In the context of few-shot classification, the goal is to train a classifier using a limited number of samples while maintaining satisfactory performance. However, traditional metric-based methods exhibit certain limitations in achieving this objective. These methods typically rely on a single distance value between the query feature and support feature, thereby overlooking the contribution of shallow features. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel approach in this paper. Our approach involves utilizing multi-output embedding network that maps samples into distinct feature spaces. The proposed method extract feature vectors at different stages, enabling the model to capture both global and abstract features. By utilizing these diverse feature spaces, our model enhances its performance. Moreover, employing a self-attention mechanism improves the refinement of features at each stage, leading to even more robust representations and improved overall performance. Furthermore, assigning learnable weights to each stage significantly improved performance and results. We conducted comprehensive evaluations on the MiniImageNet and FC100 datasets, specifically in the 5-way 1-shot and 5-way 5-shot scenarios. Additionally, we performed a cross-domain task from MiniImageNet to the CUB dataset, achieving high accuracy in the testing domain. These evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed method in comparison to state-of-the-art approaches. https://github.com/FatemehAskari/MSENet\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-12\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the **GatedMetaLinearAttention (GMLA)**, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key areas and information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Novelty and Originality\n\n- **Unique Contributions**: The researcher needs to identify how GMLA differs from existing models like **GLAT** (Yang et al., 2023) and **Meta-Transformer** (Zhao et al., 2021).

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/29 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n2022.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 19 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"meta-learning gated linear attention\", \"hierarchical gating transformers\", \"dynamic parameter generation attention\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Fujiwara*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets, and model the relative densities by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution.\n\n**Abstract:** The ratio of two probability densities, called a density-ratio, is a vital quantity in machine learning. In particular, a relative density-ratio, which is a bounded extension of the density-ratio, has received much attention due to its stability and has been used in various applications such as outlier detection and dataset comparison. Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio estimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However, sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets. Specifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model extracts the datasets' information by using neural networks and uses it to obtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the relative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form solution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its differentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test error for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few instances. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using three problems: relative DRE, dataset comparison, and outlier detection.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Learning to Propagate for Graph Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning gated linear attention\"*\n\n*Lu Liu, Tianyi Zhou, Guodong Long, Jing Jiang, Chengqi Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that a meta-learner that explicitly relates tasks on a graph describing the relations of their output dimensions (e.g., classes) can signi\ufb01cantly improve few-shot learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning extracts the common knowledge from learning different tasks and uses it for unseen tasks. It can signi\ufb01cantly improve tasks that suffer from insuf\ufb01cient training data, e.g., few-shot learning. In most meta-learning methods, tasks are implicitly related by sharing parameters or optimizer. In this paper, we show that a meta-learner that explicitly relates tasks on a graph describing the relations of their output dimensions (e.g., classes) can signi\ufb01cantly improve few-shot learning. The graph\u2019s structure is usually free or cheap to obtain but has rarely been explored in previous works. We develop a novel meta-learner of this type for prototype based classi\ufb01cation, in which a prototype is generated for each class, such that the nearest neighbor search among the prototypes produces an accurate classi\ufb01cation. The meta-learner, called \u201cGated Propagation Network (GPN)\u201d, learns to propagate messages between prototypes of different classes on the graph, so that learning the prototype of each class bene\ufb01ts from the data of other related classes. In GPN, an attention mechanism aggregates messages from neighboring classes of each class, with a gate choosing between the aggregated message and the message from the class itself. We train GPN on a sequence of tasks from many-shot to few-shot generated by subgraph sampling. During training, it is able to reuse and update previously achieved prototypes from the memory in a life-long learning cycle. In experiments, under different training-test discrepancy and test task generation settings, GPN outperforms recent meta-learning methods on two benchmark datasets.

Grokking of Hierarchical Structure in Vanilla Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating transformers\"*\n\n*Shikhar Murty, Pratyusha Sharma, Jacob Andreas, Christopher D. Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated.\n\n**Abstract:** For humans, language production and comprehension is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of sentences. In natural language processing, past work has questioned how effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated. We call this phenomenon structural grokking. On multiple datasets, structural grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth: intermediate-depth models generalize better than both very deep and very shallow transformers. When analyzing the relationship between model-internal properties and grokking, we find that optimal depth for grokking can be identified using the tree-structuredness metric of CITATION. Overall, our work provides strong evidence that, with extended training, vanilla transformers discover and use hierarchical structure.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Dynamic and Efficient Inference for Text Generation via BERT Family\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic parameter generation attention\"*\n\n*Xiaobo Liang, Juntao Li, Lijun Wu, Ziqiang Cao, M. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning gated linear attention\"*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments.

Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating transformers\"*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Songlin Yang, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have surpassed RNNs in popularity due to their superior\nabilities in parallel training and long-term dependency modeling. Recently,\nthere has been a renewed interest in using linear RNNs for efficient sequence\nmodeling. These linear RNNs often employ gating mechanisms in the output of the\nlinear recurrence layer while ignoring the significance of using forget gates\nwithin the recurrence. In this paper, we propose a gated linear RNN model\ndubbed Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), which includes\nforget gates that are lower bounded by a learnable value. The lower bound\nincreases monotonically when moving up layers. This allows the upper layers to\nmodel long-term dependencies and the lower layers to model more local,\nshort-term dependencies.

In this work, we\ninvestigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training\nthat could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively\nexperiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and\nwith different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead\nto hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling\nobjective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct\npruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language\nmodeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint\nexistence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization\nbehaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear\norder). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover\ntransformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a\ncorrelation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset\nand whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a\nhierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear\ngeneralization.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-25T07:10:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-31T23:47:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector\n  Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic parameter generation attention\"*\n\n*Di Liu, Meng Chen, Baotong Lu, Huiqiang Jiang, Zhenhua Han, Qianxi Zhang, Qi Chen, Chengruidong Zhang, Bailu Ding, Kai Zhang, Chen Chen, Fan Yang, Yuqing Yang, Lili Qiu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly\nimportant. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention\ncomputation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference\nlatency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors.\nThis paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both\naccelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By\nleveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention\nproposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV\nvectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search\nduring generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS\nindexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the\nout-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention\nmechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an\nattention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of\nquery vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to\naccess 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to\nsignificant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much\nlower GPU memory footprint.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"hierarchical gating transformers\"*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7).

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic parameter generation attention\"*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost.

H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"dynamic parameter generation attention\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the  $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ which significantly reduces its memory footprint.  Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. \n We call these tokens Heavy Hitters ($\\mathsf{H_2}$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that ($i$) the emergence of $\\mathsf{H_2}$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and ($ii$) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle ($\\mathsf{H_2O}$), a $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and $\\mathsf{H_2}$ tokens.\n We formulate the $\\mathsf{KV}$ $\\mathsf{cache}$ eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of $\\mathsf{H_2O}$ with 20\\% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to $29\\times$, $29\\times$, and $3\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B.

This involves analyzing the specific mechanisms, advantages, and limitations of these models to identify areas where GMLA can differentiate itself.\n  - For example, GLAT enhances linear attention with gating mechanisms but may not incorporate meta-learning. MEGA introduces a moving average to gated attention, which could be a point of differentiation if GMLA uses a different approach to incorporate inductive bias.\n  - **References**: Yang et al. (2023) for GLAT, Ma et al. (2022) for MEGA, and Zhang et al.

While linear attention reduces complexity, it often struggles to capture important dependencies effectively due to its uniform processing of all inputs.

    "abstract": "This proposal introduces RoutedSparseLinearAttention (RSLA), a novel enhancement to LinearAttention that combines differentiable routing with sparse computation patterns. By introducing learnable routing functions that dynamically determine sparse attention patterns and a memory-efficient implementation leveraging block-wise computation, RSLA achieves improved efficiency and expressiveness while maintaining computational tractability. The design leverages insights from recent advances in differentiable sparsity and memory optimization to create a more adaptive and efficient attention mechanism.",
