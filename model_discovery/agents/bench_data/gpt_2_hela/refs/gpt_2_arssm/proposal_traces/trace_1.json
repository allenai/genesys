Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.58)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/40 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nWe refer the readers to Appendix C. 6 for further details regarding the task and models. ### 4.7 LANGUAGE MODELLING\n\nWe perform experiments on the WikiText-103 data corpus (Merity et al., 2016) for the language modeling task. Here, the task is to predict probabilities for next or masked words, evaluated through perplexity. Quantitative Results: We use 6-layered transformer models with parameter. We plot the validation perplexity against epochs in Figure 7 which highlights that our proposed attention mechanism not only outperforms the baseline but also converges faster. Further, we see that our proposed model obtains test perplexity $38.8_{ \\pm 0.0}$ as opposed to baseline's perplexity $39.6_{ \\pm 0.3}$. We refer the reader to Appendix C. 7 for further details. ## 5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-09.jpg?height=429&width=549&top_left_y=1146&top_left_x=1189)\n\nFigure 7: Performance on Language Modeling (WikiText103). We illustrate that our proposed mechanism outperforms the standard multi-head attention. Summary. In this work, we revisit Multi-Head Attention, a popular attention mechanism, and highlight its shortcomings due to the rigid association between search and retrieval mechanisms. We argue that this rigid coupling hinders re-usability of parameters and reduces the expressivity of the model. To mitigate this, we propose a novel mechanism which uses a value retrieval mechanism to flexibly compose searches and retrievals. Experiments on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms standard multi-head transformers, while often using only a fraction of retrievals. Complexity. While our proposed mechanism requires additional parameters for the computation of value scores, we highlight that this increase is often minuscule compared to the total number of parameters. Crucially, we note that this light increase in parameters per search mechanism is easily offset by reducing the number of retrievals needed. For all our experiments, our proposed models offer similar capacity as the baselines unless stated otherwise. This highlights that the improved performance is due to flexible composition of search and retrieval and not number of parameters. We discuss computational complexity in detail in Appendix B.5. Limitations and Conclusion. Motivated by the need for efficient factorization of knowledge and dynamic reusability of learned pieces of computations, we propose Compositional Attention, a first step towards flexible composition of search and retrieval.\n```\n\n#### 2. Repeat After Me: Transformers are Better than State Space Models at Copying (Avg. Score: 0.19)\n\n*Samy Jelassi, David Brandfonbrener, S. Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

Score: 0.17)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415.

Tailoring Self-Attention for Graph via Rooted Subtrees\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism limitations*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yunchong Song, Jiayue Zhou, Zhouhan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel multi-hop graph attention mechanism, named Subtree Attention (STA), is proposed, which seamlessly bridges the fully-attentional structure and the rooted subtree, with theoretical proof that STA approximates the global attention under extreme settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have made significant strides in graph learning, yet they still exhibit notable limitations: local attention faces challenges in capturing long-range information due to the inherent problems of the message-passing scheme, while global attention cannot reflect the hierarchical neighborhood structure and fails to capture fine-grained local information. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-hop graph attention mechanism, named Subtree Attention (STA), to address the aforementioned issues. STA seamlessly bridges the fully-attentional structure and the rooted subtree, with theoretical proof that STA approximates the global attention under extreme settings. By allowing direct computation of attention weights among multi-hop neighbors, STA mitigates the inherent problems in existing graph attention mechanisms. Further we devise an efficient form for STA by employing kernelized softmax, which yields a linear time complexity. Our resulting GNN architecture, the STAGNN, presents a simple yet performant STA-based graph neural network leveraging a hop-aware attention strategy. Comprehensive evaluations on ten node classification datasets demonstrate that STA-based models outperform existing graph transformers and mainstream GNNs.

ClusterFormer: Neural Clustering Attention for Efficient and Effective Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism limitations*\n\n*Ning Wang, Guobing Gan, Peng Zhang, Shuai Zhang, Junqiu Wei, Qun Liu, Xin Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A neural clustering method which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer, which groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, a lot of research has been carried out to improve the efficiency of Transformer. Among them, the sparse pattern-based method is an important branch of efficient Transformers. However, some existing sparse methods usually use fixed patterns to select words, without considering similarities between words. Other sparse methods use clustering patterns to select words, but the clustering process is separate from the training process of the target task, which causes a decrease in effectiveness. To address these limitations, we design a neural clustering method, which can be seamlessly integrated into the Self-Attention Mechanism in Transformer. The clustering task and the target task are jointly trained and optimized to benefit each other, leading to significant effectiveness improvement. In addition, our method groups the words with strong dependencies into the same cluster and performs the attention mechanism for each cluster independently, which improves the efficiency. We verified our method on machine translation, text classification, natural language inference, and text matching tasks. Experimental results show that our method outperforms two typical sparse attention methods, Reformer and Routing Transformer while having a comparable or even better time and memory efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. FSUIE: A Novel Fuzzy Span Mechanism for Universal Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism limitations*\n\n*Tianshuo Peng, Z. Li, Lefei Zhang, Bo Du, Hai Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Fuzzy Span Universal Information Extraction (FSUIE) framework is proposed, which consists of two concepts: fuzzy span loss and fuzzy span attention and demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization of FSUIE in different tasks, settings, and scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Universal Information Extraction (UIE) has been introduced as a unified framework for various Information Extraction (IE) tasks and has achieved widespread success. Despite this, UIE models have limitations. For example, they rely heavily on span boundaries in the data during training, which does not reflect the reality of span annotation challenges. Slight adjustments to positions can also meet requirements. Additionally, UIE models lack attention to the limited span length feature in IE. To address these deficiencies, we propose the Fuzzy Span Universal Information Extraction (FSUIE) framework. Specifically, our contribution consists of two concepts: fuzzy span loss and fuzzy span attention. Our experimental results on a series of main IE tasks show significant improvement compared to the baseline, especially in terms of fast convergence and strong performance with small amounts of data and training epochs. These results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization of FSUIE in different tasks, settings, and scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Graph Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: novel attention architectures*\n\n*Petar Velickovic, Guillem Cucurull, Arantxa Casanova, Adriana Romero, P. Lio\u2019, Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** We present graph attention networks (GATs), novel neural network architectures that operate on graph-structured data, leveraging masked self-attentional layers to address the shortcomings of prior methods based on graph convolutions or their approximations. By stacking layers in which nodes are able to attend over their neighborhoods' features, we enable (implicitly) specifying different weights to different nodes in a neighborhood, without requiring any kind of costly matrix operation (such as inversion) or depending on knowing the graph structure upfront. In this way, we address several key challenges of spectral-based graph neural networks simultaneously, and make our model readily applicable to inductive as well as transductive problems. Our GAT models have achieved or matched state-of-the-art results across four established transductive and inductive graph benchmarks: the Cora, Citeseer and Pubmed citation network datasets, as well as a protein-protein interaction dataset (wherein test graphs remain unseen during training).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 17264  (*Influential: 3041*)\n\n#### 5. Representing Long-Range Context for Graph Neural Networks with Global Attention\n\n*From Search Query: novel attention architectures*\n\n*Zhanghao Wu, Paras Jain, Matthew A. Wright, Azalia Mirhoseini, Joseph E. Gonzalez, Ion Stoica*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel readout mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding, and suggests that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long- range relationships on graphs.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks are powerful architectures for structured datasets. However, current methods struggle to represent long-range dependencies. Scaling the depth or width of GNNs is insufficient to broaden receptive fields as larger GNNs encounter optimization instabilities such as vanishing gradients and representation oversmoothing, while pooling-based approaches have yet to become as universally useful as in computer vision. In this work, we propose the use of Transformer-based self-attention to learn long-range pairwise relationships, with a novel\"readout\"mechanism to obtain a global graph embedding. Inspired by recent computer vision results that find position-invariant attention performant in learning long-range relationships, our method, which we call GraphTrans, applies a permutation-invariant Transformer module after a standard GNN module. This simple architecture leads to state-of-the-art results on several graph classification tasks, outperforming methods that explicitly encode graph structure. Our results suggest that purely-learning-based approaches without graph structure may be suitable for learning high-level, long-range relationships on graphs.

Equiformer: Equivariant Graph Attention Transformer for 3D Atomistic Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: novel attention architectures*\n\n*Yi Liao, T.

In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 158  (*Influential: 22*)\n\n#### 7. GistScore: Learning Better Representations for In-Context Example Selection with Gist Bottlenecks\n\n*From Search Query: attention bottlenecks*\n\n*Shivanshu Gupta, Clemens Rosenbaum, Ethan R. Elenberg*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example encoders through supervised fine-tuning with an attention bottleneck between the inputs and outputs, which forms the basis for GistScore, a novel metric for scoring and selecting informative examples.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context Learning (ICL) is the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform new tasks when conditioned on prompts comprising a few task examples. However, ICL performance can be critically sensitive to the choice of examples. To dynamically select the best examples for every test input, we propose Example Gisting, a novel approach for training example encoders through supervised fine-tuning with an attention bottleneck between the inputs and outputs. These gist models form the basis for GistScore, a novel metric for scoring and selecting informative examples. Further, we experiment with two variations: (1) fine-tuning gist models for each dataset and (2) multi-task training a single model on a large collection of datasets. The latter can be used for new tasks out-of-the-box, enabling a training-free ICL pipeline. Evaluations with 21 datasets spanning 9 tasks and 8 diverse LLMs show that our fine-tuned models get state-of-the-art ICL performance with over 20% absolute gain over off-the-shelf retrievers and 5% over the best prior methods. Further, our multi-task model generalizes well to new tasks, datasets, and prompt templates. Selection using this model matches or outperforms prior methods while being three orders of magnitude faster than the strongest training-free baseline.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation\n\n*From Search Query: attention bottlenecks*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, Scatterbrain is proposed, a novel way to unify sparse and low-rank attention for accurate and efficient approximation and is unbiased with provably low error.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity or low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and memory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the\nattention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are\nexisting attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they\nhave limited ability to effectively compute global information.

Breaking the Attention Bottleneck\n\n*From Search Query: attention bottlenecks*\n\n*Kalle Hilsenbek*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based transformers have become the standard architecture in many\ndeep learning fields, primarily due to their ability to model long-range\ndependencies and handle variable-length input sequences. However, the attention\nmechanism with its quadratic complexity is a significant bottleneck in the\ntransformer architecture. This algorithm is only uni-directional in the decoder\nand converges to a static pattern in over-parametrized decoder-only models. I\naddress this issue by developing a generative function as attention or\nactivation replacement. It still has the auto-regressive character by comparing\neach token with the previous one. In my test setting with nanoGPT this yields a\nsmaller loss while having a smaller model. The loss further drops by\nincorporating an average context vector.

Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism limitations*\n\n*Anirudh Ravula, Santiago Ontanon, Manzil Zaheer, Chris Alberti, Avinava Dubey, Philip Pham, Joshua Ainslie, Amr Ahmed, Qifan Wang, Li Yang, Guru Guruganesh*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: attention mechanism limitations*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Episodic Transformer for Vision-and-Language Navigation\n\n*From Search Query: novel attention architectures*\n\n*Chen Sun, Cordelia Schmid, Alexander Pashevich*\n\n**Abstract:** Interaction and navigation defined by natural language instructions in dynamic environments pose significant challenges for neural agents. This paper focuses on addressing two challenges: handling long sequence of subtasks, and understanding complex human instructions. We propose Episodic Transformer (E.T.), a multimodal transformer that encodes language inputs and the full episode history of visual observations and actions. To improve training, we leverage synthetic instructions as an intermediate representation that decouples understanding the visual appearance of an environment from the variations of natural language instructions. We demonstrate that encoding the history with a transformer is critical to solve compositional tasks, and that pretraining and joint training with synthetic instructions further improve the performance. Our approach sets a new state of the art on the challenging ALFRED benchmark, achieving 38.4% and 8.5% task success rates on seen and unseen test splits.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-13\n\n\n\n#### 4.

To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-30\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Attention Bottlenecks for Multimodal Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: attention bottlenecks*\n\n*Chen Sun, Cordelia Schmid, Aren Jansen, Anurag Arnab, Shan Yang, Arsha Nagrani*\n\n**Abstract:** Humans perceive the world by concurrently processing and fusing high-dimensional inputs from multiple modalities such as vision and audio. Machine perception models, in stark contrast, are typically modality-specific and optimised for unimodal benchmarks, and hence late-stage fusion of final representations or predictions from each modality (`late-fusion') is still a dominant paradigm for multimodal video classification. Instead, we introduce a novel transformer based architecture that uses `fusion bottlenecks' for modality fusion at multiple layers. Compared to traditional pairwise self-attention, our model forces information between different modalities to pass through a small number of bottleneck latents, requiring the model to collate and condense the most relevant information in each modality and only share what is necessary. We find that such a strategy improves fusion performance, at the same time reducing computational cost. We conduct thorough ablation studies, and achieve state-of-the-art results on multiple audio-visual classification benchmarks including Audioset, Epic-Kitchens and VGGSound. All code and models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design by addressing the specified areas, here are some key findings and insights from the provided sources:\n\n## Fundamental Limitations and Bottlenecks in Current Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The paper \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed\" highlights that not all attention layers in Transformer models are equally important. This suggests that some attention layers can be pruned or simplified without significant performance degradation, indicating inefficiencies in the current attention mechanisms.\n\n- The \"Differential Transformer\" paper by Microsoft Research discusses the \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon, where traditional Transformer models struggle to retrieve key information from long contexts due to the softmax bottleneck. This bottleneck causes the model to over-attend to irrelevant context, leading to performance degradation.\n\n- The work on \"Fundamental Limitations on Subquadratic Alternatives to Transformers\" proves that any approach to replace the quadratic-time attention mechanism with a subquadratic alternative cannot perform certain tasks that Transformers can, such as document similarity tasks. This underscores a fundamental limitation of current attention mechanisms in terms of computational complexity.\n\n## Novel Mathematical Approaches to Attention\n\n- The \"Differential Transformer\" introduces a novel \"differential attention\" mechanism that partitions the query and key vectors into two groups and computes two separate softmax attention maps. The difference between these maps is used as the attention score, which helps in canceling out noise and focusing on relevant context. This approach is analogous to noise-canceling headphones and differential amplifiers.\n\n- The \"Probabilistic Sparse Attention\" mechanism proposed in the \"MPSA-Conformer-CTC/Attention\" model addresses the computational complexity of attention calculations by applying sparse attention. This approach reduces the time and space complexity while enhancing the model\u2019s performance and stability.\n\n## Specific Challenges and Failure Cases in Existing Attention Architectures\n\n- The \"lost-in-the-middle\" phenomenon and the softmax bottleneck are significant challenges in traditional Transformer models. These issues lead to the model's inability to robustly use information in long input contexts and result in spurious attention patterns and hallucinations.\n\n- The inefficiency of attention layers, as highlighted in \"What Matters in Transformers? Not All Attention is Needed,\" indicates that some layers may not contribute significantly to the model's performance, suggesting room for optimization and pruning.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Attention Mechanism Capabilities and Limitations\n\n- The theoretical analysis in \"Fundamental Limitations on Subquadratic Alternatives to Transformers\" provides a rigorous proof that certain tasks, such as document similarity, cannot be performed in subquadratic time by any algorithm, emphasizing the inherent limitations of current attention mechanisms.\n\n- The \"Differential Transformer\" paper provides a theoretical basis for why the classic Transformer attention mechanism fails to focus on relevant context due to the softmax function's properties, which restrict attention scores to positive values and force them to sum to 1. This leads to a theoretical bottleneck that prevents the model from learning sparse attention distributions.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can gain a deeper understanding of the current limitations and bottlenecks in attention mechanisms, explore novel mathematical approaches to address these issues, and identify specific challenges that need to be overcome to improve autoregressive language model design.\n",

While sparsify the Key-Value (KV) cache of transformer model is a typical strategy to alleviate resource usage, it unavoidably results in the loss of information. We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability. Experimental validation has demonstrated that LoMA significantly reducing computational consumption and memory usage through achieving lossless KV cache compression.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/16 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$. However, none of these works can achieve lossless compression of context.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse and continuous attention mechanisms (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Andr\u00e9 F. T.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/36 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n# Sparse and Continuous Attention Mechanisms \n\nAndr\u00e9 F.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/50 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nWe also report competitive results on enwik-8 ( 0.99 vs 0.98 perplexity) and present ablations on CIFAR-10. ## 2 Related Work\n\nAttention with Temporal Sparsity: Research on efficient attention neural models parallels the advent of attention-based architectures. In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Our method is based on differentiable sorting of internal representations. Concretely, we introduce a meta sorting network that learns to generate latent permutations over sequences. Given sorted sequences, we are then able to compute quasi-global attention with only local windows, improving the memory efficiency of the attention module. To this end, we propose new algorithmic innovations such as Causal Sinkhorn Balancing and SortCut, a dynamic sequence truncation method for tailoring Sinkhorn Attention for encoding and/or decoding purposes. Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

Aguiar*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper extends alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families, and introduces continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}.\n\n**Abstract:** Exponential families are widely used in machine learning; they include many distributions in continuous and discrete domains (e.g., Gaussian, Dirichlet, Poisson, and categorical distributions via the softmax transformation). Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of the idea that these super-sparse complex feature detectors can serve as prototype memory priors for modulating the image synthesis processes in the visual system.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 273  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 4. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.

To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

SPECTRA: Sparse Structured Text Rationalization\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Nuno Miguel Guerreiro, Andr\u00e9 F. T. Martins*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective rationalization aims to produce decisions along with rationales\n(e.g., text highlights or word alignments between two sentences). Commonly,\nrationales are modeled as stochastic binary masks, requiring sampling-based\ngradient estimators, which complicates training and requires careful\nhyperparameter tuning. Sparse attention mechanisms are a deterministic\nalternative, but they lack a way to regularize the rationale extraction (e.g.,\nto control the sparsity of a text highlight or the number of alignments). In\nthis paper, we present a unified framework for deterministic extraction of\nstructured explanations via constrained inference on a factor graph, forming a\ndifferentiable layer. Our approach greatly eases training and rationale\nregularization, generally outperforming previous work on what comes to\nperformance and plausibility of the extracted rationales. We further provide a\ncomparative study of stochastic and deterministic methods for rationale\nextraction for classification and natural language inference tasks, jointly\nassessing their predictive power, quality of the explanations, and model\nvariability.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-09T20:39:56Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-09T20:39:56Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for\nachieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU,\nand show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training\nstability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized\ninitialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call\nRectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than\npreviously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the\nTransformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA\nachieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with\ntraining and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our\nanalysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and\nthe induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to\nsource-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models.\nIntriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. 'switch off')\nfor some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-14T17:52:38Z  (*Updated: 2021-10-06T14:04:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured\n  LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that\nprocess multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of\ntokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative\ndecoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications\nare inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during\nattention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose\nFlattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the\nKV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU\nutilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and\nnearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves\nup to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three\npractical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention\nalgorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-30T04:34:54Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

We propose in this paper a\nnew framework for sparse and structured attention, building upon a smoothed max\noperator. We show that the gradient of this operator defines a mapping from\nreal values to probabilities, suitable as an attention mechanism. Our framework\nincludes softmax and a slight generalization of the recently-proposed sparsemax\nas special cases. However, we also show how our framework can incorporate\nmodern structured penalties, resulting in more interpretable attention\nmechanisms, that focus on entire segments or groups of an input. We derive\nefficient algorithms to compute the forward and backward passes of our\nattention mechanisms, enabling their use in a neural network trained with\nbackpropagation. To showcase their potential as a drop-in replacement for\nexisting ones, we evaluate our attention mechanisms on three large-scale tasks:\ntextual entailment, machine translation, and sentence summarization. Our\nattention mechanisms improve interpretability without sacrificing performance;\nnotably, on textual entailment and summarization, we outperform the standard\nattention mechanisms based on softmax and sparsemax.\n\n**Conference:** a-regularized-framework-for-sparse-and-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Attentive State-Space Modeling of Disease Progression\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Mihaela van der Schaar, Ahmed M. Alaa*\n\n**Abstract:** Models of disease progression are instrumental for predicting patient outcomes and understanding disease dynamics. Existing models provide the patient with pragmatic (supervised) predictions of risk, but do not provide the clinician with intelligible (unsupervised) representations of disease pathophysiology. In this paper, we develop the attentive state-space model, a deep probabilistic model that learns accurate and interpretable structured representations for disease trajectories. Unlike Markovian state-space models, in which the dynamics are memoryless, our model uses an attention mechanism to create \"memoryful\" dynamics, whereby attention weights determine the dependence of future disease states on past medical history. To learn the model parameters from medical records, we develop an infer ence algorithm that simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the model parameters, leveraging the attentive state-space representation to construct a  \"Rao-Blackwellized\" variational approximation of the posterior state distribution. Experiments on data from the UK Cystic Fibrosis registry show that our model demonstrates superior predictive accuracy and provides insights into the progression of chronic disease.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2019-12\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 4. Cross-attention Inspired Selective State Space Models for Target Sound Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: state space models attention*\n\n*Tianshu Qu, Xihong Wu, Yiwen Wang, Donghang Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer model, particularly its cross-attention module, is widely used for feature fusion in target sound extraction which extracts the signal of interest based on given clues. Despite its effectiveness, this approach suffers from low computational efficiency. Recent advancements in state space models, notably the latest work Mamba, have shown comparable performance to Transformer-based methods while significantly reducing computational complexity in various tasks. However, Mamba's applicability in target sound extraction is limited due to its inability to capture dependencies between different sequences as the cross-attention does. In this paper, we propose CrossMamba for target sound extraction, which leverages the hidden attention mechanism of Mamba to compute dependencies between the given clues and the audio mixture. The calculation of Mamba can be divided to the query, key and value. We utilize the clue to generate the query and the audio mixture to derive the key and value, adhering to the principle of the cross-attention mechanism in Transformers. Experimental results from two representative target sound extraction methods validate the efficacy of the proposed CrossMamba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 5. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU. We release the code at https://github.com/facebookresearch/LeViT\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention mechanisms, integration with state space models, hardware-efficient implementations, and theoretical analysis of attention mechanism expressiveness, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Recent Advances in Sparse Attention Patterns and Their Theoretical Properties\n\n- The paper \"Sparse attention with residual pyramidal depthwise separable convolutional neural networks\" discusses the use of sparse attention mechanisms to concentrate on the most pertinent features in the input data.

It introduces methods to reduce the running time complexity of attention computations, which is crucial for minimizing response latency and increasing throughput in large language models.\n\n- The concept of \"Linear Attention\" mentioned in the analysis note is also relevant here. Linear attention mechanisms have emerged as efficient alternatives to conventional softmax attention, allowing for linear computational complexities and the ability to handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed[Analysis Note].\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Attention Mechanism Expressiveness\n\n- The paper \"Attention layers provably solve single-location regression\" provides a theoretical understanding of attention mechanisms, particularly in handling sparse token information and internal linear structures. It shows the asymptotic Bayes optimality of a simplified version of a non-linear self-attention layer, which is crucial for understanding the expressiveness and learning dynamics of attention-based models.\n\n- The \"Fusion Attention for Action Recognition\" paper discusses the balance between global and sparse-dense attention mechanisms. It highlights the importance of finding an optimal balance to capture both spatial and temporal features effectively, which can be generalized to other domains requiring attention mechanisms.\n\nIn summary, the key insights include:\n\n- **Sparse Attention**: Leveraging sparsity in attention mechanisms to reduce computational complexity and improve efficiency.\n- **State Space Integration**: Augmenting attention mechanisms with state space models to address long-range dependency issues[Analysis Note].\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Optimizing attention computations to minimize latency and increase throughput, using methods like linear attention and sparse attention acceleration[Analysis Note].\n- **Theoretical Analysis**: Understanding the theoretical properties of attention mechanisms, including their ability to handle sparse information and their asymptotic Bayes optimality.\n",

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one.

Connections to other prior works. Although starting from distinct motivations, $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ closely relates to hierarchical attention (HA; Yang et al., 2016). HA summarizes the context into higherlevel representations with a cascade of attention mechanisms, e.g., words to sentences, and then to documents. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ applies two types of attention. The first learns context-agnostic pseudo-queries and attends to the same sequence for $n$ times in parallel, while the second retrieves from the memory with real queries. HA, in contrast, summarizes non-overlapping segments at each level. The learned pseudo-queries closely relate to the inducing point method in set attention (ISA; Lee et al., 2019). ISA applies a non-linear feedforward network between a cascade of two attention mod- ules. This precludes the outer-product memory computation and efficient recurrences in $A B C$. Another line of work \"linearizes\" attention through kernel tricks and also applies bounded memory: their feature map dimensions are analogous to memory sizes. They substitute the softmax with approximations (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), heuristically designed (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Schlag et al., 2021), or learned (Kasai et al., 2021b) functions. $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ keeps the softmax, but over a smaller constant-sized context. This can be useful in practice: (1) ABC provides a unified perspective of several efficient attention methods, allowing for borrowing from existing wisdom to design new architectures; (2) it draws a close analogy to the canonical softmax attention, and is better-suited as its drop-in substitute in various application settings, as we will show in the experiments; (3) empirically, we find that $\\mathrm{ABC}_{\\text {MLP }}$ can get away with a much smaller memory size to retain the accuracy.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: gated attention mechanisms, memory optimization techniques, parallel processing attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: gated attention mechanisms*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 2. A Sequential Flow Control Framework for Multi-hop Knowledge Base Question Answering\n\n*From Search Query: gated attention mechanisms*\n\n*Minghui Xie, Chuzhan Hao, Peng Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple but effective GRU-inspired Flow Control (GFC) framework to model sequential logic in the whole multi-hop process and achieves new state-of-the-art Hits@1 of 76.8% on WebQSP and is also effective when KB is incomplete.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the key challenges of knowledge base question answering (KBQA) is the multi-hop reasoning. Since in different hops, one attends to different parts of question, it is important to dynamically represent the question semantics for each hop. Existing methods, however, (i) infer the dynamic question representation only through coarse-grained attention mechanisms, which may bring information loss, (ii) and have not effectively modeled the sequential logic, which is crucial for the multi-hop reasoning process in KBQA.To address these issues, we propose a sequential reasoning self-attention mechanism to capture the crucial reasoning information of each single hop in a more fine-grained way. Based on Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) which is good at modeling sequential process, we propose a simple but effective GRU-inspired Flow Control (GFC) framework to model sequential logic in the whole multi-hop process.Extensive experiments on three popular benchmark datasets have demonstrated the superior effectiveness of our model. In particular, GFC achieves new state-of-the-art Hits@1 of 76.8% on WebQSP and is also effective when KB is incomplete.

Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lion is a simple and effective optimization algorithm that requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function and is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method to formulate algorithm discovery as program search, and apply it to discover optimization algorithms for deep neural network training. We leverage efficient search techniques to explore an infinite and sparse program space. To bridge the large generalization gap between proxy and target tasks, we also introduce program selection and simplification strategies. Our method discovers a simple and effective optimization algorithm, $\\textbf{Lion}$ ($\\textit{Evo$\\textbf{L}$ved S$\\textbf{i}$gn M$\\textbf{o}$me$\\textbf{n}$tum}$). It is more memory-efficient than Adam as it only keeps track of the momentum. Different from adaptive optimizers, its update has the same magnitude for each parameter calculated through the sign operation. We compare Lion with widely used optimizers, such as Adam and Adafactor, for training a variety of models on different tasks. On image classification, Lion boosts the accuracy of ViT by up to 2% on ImageNet and saves up to 5x the pre-training compute on JFT. On vision-language contrastive learning, we achieve 88.3% $\\textit{zero-shot}$ and 91.1% $\\textit{fine-tuning}$ accuracy on ImageNet, surpassing the previous best results by 2% and 0.1%, respectively. On diffusion models, Lion outperforms Adam by achieving a better FID score and reducing the training compute by up to 2.3x. For autoregressive, masked language modeling, and fine-tuning, Lion exhibits a similar or better performance compared to Adam. Our analysis of Lion reveals that its performance gain grows with the training batch size. It also requires a smaller learning rate than Adam due to the larger norm of the update produced by the sign function. Additionally, we examine the limitations of Lion and identify scenarios where its improvements are small or not statistically significant. Lion is also successfully deployed in production systems such as Google search ads CTR model.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 242  (*Influential: 40*)\n\n#### 4. Revisiting Zeroth-Order Optimization for Memory-Efficient LLM Fine-Tuning: A Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization techniques*\n\n*Yihua Zhang, Pingzhi Li, Junyuan Hong, Jiaxiang Li, Yimeng Zhang, Wenqing Zheng, Pin-Yu Chen, Jason D. Lee, Wotao Yin, Mingyi Hong, Zhangyang Wang, Sijia Liu, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance, and introduces novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity.\n\n**Abstract:** In the evolving landscape of natural language processing (NLP), fine-tuning pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with first-order (FO) optimizers like SGD and Adam has become standard. Yet, as LLMs grow {in size}, the substantial memory overhead from back-propagation (BP) for FO gradient computation presents a significant challenge. Addressing this issue is crucial, especially for applications like on-device training where memory efficiency is paramount. This paper proposes a shift towards BP-free, zeroth-order (ZO) optimization as a solution for reducing memory costs during LLM fine-tuning, building on the initial concept introduced by MeZO. Unlike traditional ZO-SGD methods, our work expands the exploration to a wider array of ZO optimization techniques, through a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind benchmarking study across five LLM families (Roberta, OPT, LLaMA, Vicuna, Mistral), three task complexities, and five fine-tuning schemes. Our study unveils previously overlooked optimization principles, highlighting the importance of task alignment, the role of the forward gradient method, and the balance between algorithm complexity and fine-tuning performance. We further introduce novel enhancements to ZO optimization, including block-wise descent, hybrid training, and gradient sparsity. Our study offers a promising direction for achieving further memory-efficient LLM fine-tuning.

Ponomareva, Zhe Zhao, R. Mazumder*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint, and extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework, CHITA, which leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The sheer size of modern neural networks makes model serving a serious computational challenge. A popular class of compression techniques overcomes this challenge by pruning or sparsifying the weights of pretrained networks. While useful, these techniques often face serious tradeoffs between computational requirements and compression quality. In this work, we propose a novel optimization-based pruning framework that considers the combined effect of pruning (and updating) multiple weights subject to a sparsity constraint. Our approach, CHITA, extends the classical Optimal Brain Surgeon framework and results in significant improvements in speed, memory, and performance over existing optimization-based approaches for network pruning. CHITA's main workhorse performs combinatorial optimization updates on a memory-friendly representation of local quadratic approximation(s) of the loss function. On a standard benchmark of pretrained models and datasets, CHITA leads to significantly better sparsity-accuracy tradeoffs than competing methods. For example, for MLPNet with only 2% of the weights retained, our approach improves the accuracy by 63% relative to the state of the art. Furthermore, when used in conjunction with fine-tuning SGD steps, our method achieves significant accuracy gains over the state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Recurrent Video Restoration Transformer with Guided Deformable Attention\n\n*From Search Query: parallel processing attention*\n\n*Jingyun Liang, Yuchen Fan, Xiaoyu Xiang, Rakesh Ranjan, Eddy Ilg, Simon Green, Jiezhang Cao, K. Zhang, R. Timofte, L. Gool*\n\n**TL;DR:** Extensive experiments on video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising show that the proposed RVRT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with balanced model size, testing memory and runtime.\n\n**Abstract:** Video restoration aims at restoring multiple high-quality frames from multiple low-quality frames. Existing video restoration methods generally fall into two extreme cases, i.e., they either restore all frames in parallel or restore the video frame by frame in a recurrent way, which would result in different merits and drawbacks. Typically, the former has the advantage of temporal information fusion. However, it suffers from large model size and intensive memory consumption; the latter has a relatively small model size as it shares parameters across frames; however, it lacks long-range dependency modeling ability and parallelizability. In this paper, we attempt to integrate the advantages of the two cases by proposing a recurrent video restoration transformer, namely RVRT. RVRT processes local neighboring frames in parallel within a globally recurrent framework which can achieve a good trade-off between model size, effectiveness, and efficiency. Specifically, RVRT divides the video into multiple clips and uses the previously inferred clip feature to estimate the subsequent clip feature. Within each clip, different frame features are jointly updated with implicit feature aggregation. Across different clips, the guided deformable attention is designed for clip-to-clip alignment, which predicts multiple relevant locations from the whole inferred clip and aggregates their features by the attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on video super-resolution, deblurring, and denoising show that the proposed RVRT achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with balanced model size, testing memory and runtime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 110  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n#### 7.

Past works such as IMPALA, Apex, Seed RL, Sample Factory, and others, aim to improve the system's overall throughput. In this paper, we aim to address a common bottleneck in the RL training system, i.e., parallel environment execution, which is often the slowest part of the whole system but receives little attention. With a curated design for paralleling RL environments, we have improved the RL environment simulation speed across different hardware setups, ranging from a laptop and a modest workstation, to a high-end machine such as NVIDIA DGX-A100. On a high-end machine, EnvPool achieves one million frames per second for the environment execution on Atari environments and three million frames per second on MuJoCo environments. When running EnvPool on a laptop, the speed is 2.8x that of the Python subprocess. Moreover, great compatibility with existing RL training libraries has been demonstrated in the open-sourced community, including CleanRL, rl_games, DeepMind Acme, etc. Finally, EnvPool allows researchers to iterate their ideas at a much faster pace and has great potential to become the de facto RL environment execution engine. Example runs show that it only takes five minutes to train agents to play Atari Pong and MuJoCo Ant on a laptop.

Soatto*\n\n**TL;DR:** InCA, a lightweight method for transfer learning that cross-attends to any activation layer of a pre-trained model, achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ImageNet-to-Sketch multi-task benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose InCA, a lightweight method for transfer learning that cross-attends to any activation layer of a pre-trained model. During training, InCA uses a single forward pass to extract multiple activations, which are passed to external cross-attention adapters, trained anew and combined or selected for downstream tasks. We show that, even when selecting a single top-scoring adapter, InCA achieves performance comparable to full fine-tuning, at a cost comparable to fine-tuning just the last layer. For example, with a cross-attention probe 1.3% the size of a pre-trained ViT-L/16 model, we achieve performance within 0.2% of the full fine-tuning paragon at a computational training cost of 51% of the baseline, on average across 11 downstream classification. Unlike other forms of efficient adaptation, InCA does not require backpropagating through the pre-trained model, thus leaving its execution unaltered at both training and inference. The versatility of InCA is best illustrated in fine-grained tasks, which may require accessing information absent in the last layer but accessible in intermediate layer activations. Since the backbone is fixed, InCA allows parallel ensembling as well as parallel execution of multiple tasks. InCA achieves state-of-the-art performance in the ImageNet-to-Sketch multi-task benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Inspired by\nDeepLogic, an end-to-end model trained to perform inference on logic programs,\nwe introduce IMA-GloVe-GA, an iterative neural inference network for multi-step\nreasoning expressed in natural language.

Collective Event Detection via a Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: gated attention mechanisms*\n\n*Hang Yang, Yubo Chen, Yantao Jia, Jun Zhao, Kang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional approaches to the task of ACE event detection primarily regard multiple events in one sentence as independent ones and recognize them separately by using sentence-level information. However, events in one sentence are usually interdependent and sentence-level information is often insufficient to resolve ambiguities for some types of events. This paper proposes a novel framework dubbed as Hierarchical and Bias Tagging Networks with Gated Multi-level Attention Mechanisms (HBTNGMA) to solve the two problems simultaneously. Firstly, we propose a hierachical and bias tagging networks to detect multiple events in one sentence collectively. Then, we devise a gated multi-level attention to automatically extract and dynamically fuse the sentence-level and document-level information. The experimental results on the widely used ACE 2005 dataset show that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2018-10\n\n**Published:** 2018-10-01\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Despite the remarkable progress made in the field of machine learning systems research, which has enabled the development and exploration of large models, such abilities remain confined to a small group of advanced users and industry leaders, resulting in an implicit technical barrier for the wider community to access and leverage these technologies. In this paper, we introduce PyTorch Fully Sharded Data Parallel (FSDP) as an industry-grade solution for large model training. FSDP has been closely co-designed with several key PyTorch core components including Tensor implementation, dispatcher system, and CUDA memory caching allocator, to provide non-intrusive user experiences and high training efficiency. Additionally, FSDP natively incorporates a range of techniques and settings to optimize resource utilization across a variety of hardware configurations. The experimental results demonstrate that FSDP is capable of achieving comparable performance to Distributed Data Parallel while providing support for significantly larger models with near-linear scalability in terms of TFLOPS.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Elixir: Train a Large Language Model on a Small GPU Cluster\n\n*From Search Query: memory optimization techniques*\n\n*Yang You, Shenggui Li, Hongxin Liu, Jiarui Fang, Haichen Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, large language models have achieved great success due to their unprecedented size. However, training these models poses a challenge for most researchers as it requires a substantial number of GPUs. To reduce GPU memory usage, memory partitioning, and memory offloading have been proposed. These approaches eliminate memory redundancies and offload memory usage to the CPU and NVMe memory, respectively, enabling training on small GPU clusters. However, directly deploying these solutions often leads to suboptimal efficiency. Only experienced experts can unleash the full potential of hardware by carefully tuning the distributed configuration. Thus, we present a novel solution, Elixir, which automates efficient large-model training based on pre-runtime model profiling. Elixir aims to identify the optimal combination of partitioning and offloading techniques to maximize training throughput. In our experiments, Elixir significantly outperforms the current state-of-the-art baseline. Our optimal configuration achieves up to a 3.4$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 models compared with SOTA solutions. We hope that our work will benefit individuals who lack computing resources and expertise, granting them access to large models.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Can Active Memory Replace Attention?\n\n*From Search Query: parallel processing attention*\n\n*\u0141ukasz Kaiser, Samy Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Several mechanisms to focus attention of a neural network on selected parts\nof its input or memory have been used successfully in deep learning models in\nrecent years. Attention has improved image classification, image captioning,\nspeech recognition, generative models, and learning algorithmic tasks, but it\nhad probably the largest impact on neural machine translation.\n  Recently, similar improvements have been obtained using alternative\nmechanisms that do not focus on a single part of a memory but operate on all of\nit in parallel, in a uniform way. Such mechanism, which we call active memory,\nimproved over attention in algorithmic tasks, image processing, and in\ngenerative modelling.\n  So far, however, active memory has not improved over attention for most\nnatural language processing tasks, in particular for machine translation. We\nanalyze this shortcoming in this paper and propose an extended model of active\nmemory that matches existing attention models on neural machine translation and\ngeneralizes better to longer sentences. We investigate this model and explain\nwhy previous active memory models did not succeed. Finally, we discuss when\nactive memory brings most benefits and where attention can be a better choice.\n\n**Conference:** can-active-memory-replace-attention-1\n\n**Published:** 2016-10-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on novel gating mechanisms, memory optimization, parallel processing, and theoretical analysis of hybrid architectures, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Novel Gating Mechanisms in Attention Architectures\n\n- The paper on \"AGaLiTe: Approximate Gated Linear Transformers for Online Reinforcement Learning\" introduces a Gated Linear Transformer (GaLiTe) that incorporates a gating mechanism to control the flow of information in the self-attention mechanism. This gating mechanism allows the network to learn the decay rate for each element of the recurrent state, enabling better management of past information.\n\n- Another relevant work is the \"Gated Linear Attention Transformers\" mentioned in the analysis note, which discusses how gated linear attention can trade off memory movement against parallelizability, leading to faster processing even on short sequence lengths.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization for Attention\n\n- The \"AGaLiTe\" paper also addresses memory optimization by introducing an approximate version of the GaLiTe\u2019s self-attention mechanism. This approach eliminates the need to maintain a matrix as a recurrent state, reducing memory requirements and improving efficiency.\n\n- The analysis note highlights the importance of memory access patterns and efficient memory hierarchy optimization. For example, the \"Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\" paper discusses how divide-and-conquer strategies can optimize memory access patterns, leading to better real-world performance.\n\n## Parallel Processing Techniques for Attention Computation\n\n- The \"Attention Is All You Need\" paper and subsequent works emphasize the importance of parallelizing attention mechanisms. The decomposable attention mechanism applied to feedforward networks is a key example, as it allows for easy parallelization on GPUs, which is crucial for scaling up language models.\n\n- The \"AGaLiTe\" paper introduces a self-attention mechanism that is highly parallelizable and amenable to sequential computation with a context-independent inference cost, which is beneficial for efficient parallel processing.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n- The integration of state space models (SSMs) with attention mechanisms is discussed in several references. For instance, the \"Hungry Hungry Hippos\" paper explores how SSMs can complement attention for handling long-range dependencies, and the \"Efficient Classification of Long Documents\" paper shows how SSM-pooler models can achieve comparable performance to self-attention-based models while being more efficient.\n\n- Theoretical analysis of hybrid architectures is also highlighted in the need to understand expressivity-efficiency tradeoffs and the stability and convergence properties of these models. This is mentioned in the analysis note, emphasizing the importance of mathematical analysis of attention mechanisms and their integration with other models like SSMs.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that leverage novel gating mechanisms, optimize memory usage, and enable efficient parallel processing while maintaining theoretical soundness.\n",

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/71 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\nInternational Conference on Machine Learning, 2024.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Selective Mixup Helps with Distribution Shifts, But Not (Only) because of Mixup\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating mechanisms*\n\n*Damien Teney, Jindong Wang, Ehsan Abbasnejad*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that the non-random selection of pairs affects the training distribution and improve generalization by means completely unrelated to the mixing, and a new equivalence is found between two successful methods: selective mixup and resampling.\n\n**Abstract:** Mixup is a highly successful technique to improve generalization of neural networks by augmenting the training data with combinations of random pairs. Selective mixup is a family of methods that apply mixup to specific pairs, e.g. only combining examples across classes or domains. These methods have claimed remarkable improvements on benchmarks with distribution shifts, but their mechanisms and limitations remain poorly understood. We examine an overlooked aspect of selective mixup that explains its success in a completely new light. We find that the non-random selection of pairs affects the training distribution and improve generalization by means completely unrelated to the mixing. For example in binary classification, mixup across classes implicitly resamples the data for a uniform class distribution - a classical solution to label shift. We show empirically that this implicit resampling explains much of the improvements in prior work. Theoretically, these results rely on a regression toward the mean, an accidental property that we identify in several datasets. We have found a new equivalence between two successful methods: selective mixup and resampling. We identify limits of the former, confirm the effectiveness of the latter, and find better combinations of their respective benefits.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. The Truth is in There: Improving Reasoning in Language Models with Layer-Selective Rank Reduction\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating mechanisms*\n\n*Pratyusha Sharma, Jordan T. Ash, Dipendra Misra*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is often possible to significantly improve the performance of LLMs by selectively removing higher-order components of their weight matrices, and this simple intervention is called LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER).\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a fixture in modern machine learning. Correspondingly, significant resources are allocated towards research that aims to further advance this technology, typically resulting in models of increasing size that are trained on increasing amounts of data. This work, however, demonstrates the surprising result that it is often possible to significantly improve the performance of LLMs by selectively removing higher-order components of their weight matrices. This simple intervention, which we call LAyer-SElective Rank reduction (LASER), can be done on a model after training has completed, and requires no additional parameters or data. We show extensive experiments demonstrating the generality of this finding across language models and datasets, and provide in-depth analyses offering insights into both when LASER is effective and the mechanism by which it operates.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Memory Efficient Neural Processes via Constant Memory Attention Block\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Leo Feng, Frederick Tung, Hossein Hajimirsadeghi, Y. Bengio, M. O. Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Understanding Deep Architectures with Reasoning Layer\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability*\n\n*Xinshi Chen, Yufei Zhang, C. Reisinger, Le Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper takes an initial step towards an understanding of such hybrid deep architectures by showing that properties of the algorithm layers are intimately related to the approximation and generalization abilities of the end-to-end model.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, there has been a surge of interest in combining deep learning models with reasoning in order to handle more sophisticated learning tasks. In many cases, a reasoning task can be solved by an iterative algorithm. This algorithm is often unrolled, and used as a specialized layer in the deep architecture, which can be trained end-to-end with other neural components. Although such hybrid deep architectures have led to many empirical successes, the theoretical foundation of such architectures, especially the interplay between algorithm layers and other neural layers, remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we take an initial step towards an understanding of such hybrid deep architectures by showing that properties of the algorithm layers, such as convergence, stability, and sensitivity, are intimately related to the approximation and generalization abilities of the end-to-end model. Furthermore, our analysis matches closely our experimental observations under various conditions, suggesting that our theory can provide useful guidelines for designing deep architectures with reasoning layers.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Transformers as Algorithms: Generalization and Stability in In-context Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability*\n\n*Yingcong Li, M. E. Ildiz, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Samet Oymak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work formalizes in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time and identifies an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner.\n\n**Abstract:** In-context learning (ICL) is a type of prompting where a transformer model operates on a sequence of (input, output) examples and performs inference on-the-fly. In this work, we formalize in-context learning as an algorithm learning problem where a transformer model implicitly constructs a hypothesis function at inference-time. We first explore the statistical aspects of this abstraction through the lens of multitask learning: We obtain generalization bounds for ICL when the input prompt is (1) a sequence of i.i.d. (input, label) pairs or (2) a trajectory arising from a dynamical system. The crux of our analysis is relating the excess risk to the stability of the algorithm implemented by the transformer. We characterize when transformer/attention architecture provably obeys the stability condition and also provide empirical verification. For generalization on unseen tasks, we identify an inductive bias phenomenon in which the transfer learning risk is governed by the task complexity and the number of MTL tasks in a highly predictable manner. Finally, we provide numerical evaluations that (1) demonstrate transformers can indeed implement near-optimal algorithms on classical regression problems with i.i.d. and dynamic data, (2) provide insights on stability, and (3) verify our theoretical predictions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 121  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. HUMUS-Net: Hybrid unrolled multi-scale network architecture for accelerated MRI reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability*\n\n*Zalan Fabian, M. Soltanolkotabi*\n\n**TL;DR:** HUMUS-Net is proposed, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network that establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In accelerated MRI reconstruction, the anatomy of a patient is recovered from a set of under-sampled and noisy measurements. Deep learning approaches have been proven to be successful in solving this ill-posed inverse problem and are capable of producing very high quality reconstructions. However, current architectures heavily rely on convolutions, that are content-independent and have difficulties modeling long-range dependencies in images. Recently, Transformers, the workhorse of contemporary natural language processing, have emerged as powerful building blocks for a multitude of vision tasks. These models split input images into non-overlapping patches, embed the patches into lower-dimensional tokens and utilize a self-attention mechanism that does not suffer from the aforementioned weaknesses of convolutional architectures. However, Transformers incur extremely high compute and memory cost when 1) the input image resolution is high and 2) when the image needs to be split into a large number of patches to preserve fine detail information, both of which are typical in low-level vision problems such as MRI reconstruction, having a compounding effect. To tackle these challenges, we propose HUMUS-Net, a hybrid architecture that combines the beneficial implicit bias and efficiency of convolutions with the power of Transformer blocks in an unrolled and multi-scale network. HUMUS-Net extracts high-resolution features via convolutional blocks and refines low-resolution features via a novel Transformer-based multi-scale feature extractor. Features from both levels are then synthesized into a high-resolution output reconstruction. Our network establishes new state of the art on the largest publicly available MRI dataset, the fastMRI dataset. We further demonstrate the performance of HUMUS-Net on two other popular MRI datasets and perform fine-grained ablation studies to validate our design.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated-ViGAT: Efficient Bottom-Up Event Recognition and Explanation Using a New Frame Selection Policy and Gating Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating mechanisms*\n\n*Vasileios Mezaris, Dimitrios Daskalakis, Nikolaos Gkalelis*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, Gated-ViGAT, an efficient approach for video event recognition, utilizing bottom-up (object) information, a new frame sampling policy and a gating mechanism is proposed. Specifically, the frame sampling policy uses weighted in-degrees (WiDs), derived from the adjacency matrices of graph attention networks (GATs), and a dissimilarity measure to select the most salient and at the same time diverse frames representing the event in the video. Additionally, the proposed gating mechanism fetches the selected frames sequentially, and commits early-exiting when an adequately confident decision is achieved. In this way, only a few frames are processed by the computationally expensive branch of our network that is responsible for the bottom-up information extraction. The experimental evaluation on two large, publicly available video datasets (MiniKinetics, ActivityNet) demonstrates that Gated-ViGAT provides a large computational complexity reduction in comparison to our previous approach (ViGAT), while maintaining the excellent event recognition and explainability performance.

Focal Modulation Networks\n\n*From Search Query: selective gating mechanisms*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Lu Yuan, Xiyang Dai, Chunyuan Li, Jianwei Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose focal modulation networks (FocalNets in short), where self-attention (SA) is completely replaced by a focal modulation mechanism for modeling token interactions in vision. Focal modulation comprises three components: (i) hierarchical contextualization, implemented using a stack of depth-wise convolutional layers, to encode visual contexts from short to long ranges, (ii) gated aggregation to selectively gather contexts for each query token based on its content, and (iii) element-wise modulation or affine transformation to inject the aggregated context into the query. Extensive experiments show FocalNets outperform the state-of-the-art SA counterparts (e.g., Swin and Focal Transformers) with similar computational costs on the tasks of image classification, object detection, and segmentation. Specifically, FocalNets with tiny and base size achieve 82.3% and 83.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K. After pretrained on ImageNet-22K in 224 resolution, it attains 86.5% and 87.3% top-1 accuracy when finetuned with resolution 224 and 384, respectively. When transferred to downstream tasks, FocalNets exhibit clear superiority. For object detection with Mask R-CNN, FocalNet base trained with 1\\times outperforms the Swin counterpart by 2.1 points and already surpasses Swin trained with 3\\times schedule (49.0 v.s. 48.5). For semantic segmentation with UPerNet, FocalNet base at single-scale outperforms Swin by 2.4, and beats Swin at multi-scale (50.5 v.s. 49.7). Using large FocalNet and Mask2former, we achieve 58.5 mIoU for ADE20K semantic segmentation, and 57.9 PQ for COCO Panoptic Segmentation. Using huge FocalNet and DINO, we achieved 64.3 and 64.4 mAP on COCO minival and test-dev, respectively, establishing new SoTA on top of much larger attention-based models like Swinv2-G and BEIT-3.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K).

However, their remarkable performance is accompanied by heavy computation costs, which makes them unsuitable for real-time applications. In this paper, we propose a family of high-speed vision transformers named EfficientViT. We find that the speed of existing transformer models is commonly bounded by memory inefficient operations, especially the tensor reshaping and element-wise functions in MHSA. Therefore, we design a new building block with a sandwich layout, i.e., using a single memory-bound MHSA between efficient FFN layers, which improves memory efficiency while enhancing channel communication. Moreover, we discover that the attention maps share high similarities across heads, leading to computational redundancy. To address this, we present a cascaded group attention module feeding attention heads with different splits of the full feature, which not only saves computation cost but also improves attention diversity. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate EfficientViT outperforms existing efficient models, striking a good trade-off between speed and accuracy. For instance, our EfficientViT-M5 surpasses MobileNetV3-Large by 1.9% in accuracy, while getting 40.4% and 45.2% higher throughput on Nvidia V100 GPU and Intel Xeon CPU, respectively. Compared to the recent efficient model MobileViT-XXS, EfficientViT-M2 achieves 1.8% superior accuracy, while running 5.8x/3.7x faster on the GPU/CPU, and 7.4x faster when converted to ONNX format.

Complex Gated Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability*\n\n*Moritz Wolter, Angela Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Complex numbers have long been favoured for digital signal processing, yet\ncomplex representations rarely appear in deep learning architectures. RNNs,\nwidely used to process time series and sequence information, could greatly\nbenefit from complex representations. We present a novel complex gated\nrecurrent cell, which is a hybrid cell combining complex-valued and\nnorm-preserving state transitions with a gating mechanism. The resulting RNN\nexhibits excellent stability and convergence properties and performs\ncompetitively on the synthetic memory and adding task, as well as on the\nreal-world tasks of human motion prediction.\n\n**Conference:** complex-gated-recurrent-neural-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-21\n\n\n\n#### 6. AFS: An Attention-based mechanism for Supervised Feature Selection\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture stability*\n\n*Danni Ge, Ning Gui, Ziyin Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** As an effective data preprocessing step, feature selection has shown its\neffectiveness to prepare high-dimensional data for many machine learning tasks.\nThe proliferation of high di-mension and huge volume big data, however, has\nbrought major challenges, e.g. computation complexity and stability on noisy\ndata, upon existing feature-selection techniques. This paper introduces a novel\nneural network-based feature selection architecture, dubbed Attention-based\nFeature Selec-tion (AFS). AFS consists of two detachable modules: an at-tention\nmodule for feature weight generation and a learning module for the problem\nmodeling. The attention module for-mulates correlation problem among features\nand supervision target into a binary classification problem, supported by a\nshallow attention net for each feature. Feature weights are generated based on\nthe distribution of respective feature se-lection patterns adjusted by\nbackpropagation during the train-ing process. The detachable structure allows\nexisting off-the-shelf models to be directly reused, which allows for much less\ntraining time, demands for the training data and requirements for expertise. A\nhybrid initialization method is also intro-duced to boost the selection\naccuracy for datasets without enough samples for feature weight generation.\nExperimental results show that AFS achieves the best accuracy and stability in\ncomparison to several state-of-art feature selection algo-rithms upon both\nMNIST, noisy MNIST and several datasets with small samples.\n\n**Published:** 2019-02-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design, focusing on selective gating mechanisms, memory-efficient attention, hybrid architecture stability, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key insights and relevant information:\n\n## Selective Gating Mechanisms for Efficient Memory Management\n\n- The concept of gating mechanisms is well-established in recurrent neural networks, particularly in Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. LSTMs use input gates, output gates, and forget gates to manage the flow of information, allowing for selective retention and discard of information. This is crucial for efficient memory management and learning long-term dependencies.\n\n- In the context of attention mechanisms, gated linear attention transformers can be particularly useful. These models incorporate gating mechanisms to control information flow, enabling a trade-off between memory movement and parallelizability, which can lead to faster processing even on short sequence lengths in the analysis note.\n\n## Stability Analysis of Hybrid Attention Architectures\n\n- Hybrid architectures combining different attention mechanisms (e.g., linear attention and softmax attention) require careful stability analysis. Theoretical foundations such as understanding expressivity-efficiency trade-offs and mathematical analysis of hybrid architectures are essential. This involves examining the stability and convergence properties of these models to ensure they are trainable and efficient in the analysis note.\n\n- The stability of hybrid architectures can be influenced by the design of the gating mechanisms and how they interact with different components of the model. For instance, gated linear attention transformers need to be designed with stability in mind to avoid issues during training and inference in the analysis note.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Selective Attention\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations are critical for scalable and efficient LM designs. Models like Gated Linear Attention Transformers are designed with hardware-aware training in mind, which helps in achieving faster processing times without significant computational overhead in the analysis note.\n\n- Techniques such as using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) for long convolutions, as seen in FlashFFTConv, can optimize hardware utilization and reduce computational complexity, making the models more efficient in terms of hardware resources in the analysis note.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques in Production Systems\n\n- Memory optimization is a key aspect of efficient LM design. Hierarchical memory structures and efficient memory access patterns can significantly improve performance. This involves balancing memory movement against parallelization and optimizing local and global computations in the analysis note.\n\n- Techniques like divide-and-conquer strategies for attention computation can help in optimizing memory usage and improving parallelizability. This approach can be particularly effective in production systems where resource efficiency is crucial in the analysis note.\n\nIn summary, the following points are crucial for improving autoregressive LM design:\n\n- **Selective Gating Mechanisms**: Incorporate gating mechanisms similar to those in LSTMs to control information flow efficiently.\n- **Stability Analysis**: Conduct thorough theoretical analysis of hybrid architectures to ensure stability and convergence.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Design models with hardware-aware training and optimization techniques like FFT for efficient resource utilization.\n- **Memory Optimization**: Use hierarchical memory structures, efficient memory access patterns, and divide-and-conquer strategies to optimize memory usage.\n\nThese approaches can help in achieving better overall performance, scalability, and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n",

To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. ## 1. Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/32 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nIts effectiveness has been extensively validated. The approach involves using tiling strategies to minimize the amount of memory reads/writes between the high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. ## 8. Conclusion and Limitations\n\nWe presented CHELA for robust and efficient modeling of long sequences. CHELA is an SSM-attention hybrid architecture that computes both structured and data-dependent patterns in linear time with respect to sequence length. Its superior performance is enabled by considering the global view of the Short-Long Convolutions and real linear\n\nHardware-Efficient Linear Attention with gating mechanisms. Compared to other hybrid linear models, we are currently the first to achieve performance improvement while maintaining linear complexity. Our large-scale and diverse experiments demonstrate that CHELA is an efficient and flexible long sequence model with excellent performance on image, text, logical reasoning, and speech data. However, CHELA also has some limitations. The optimal combinations of short convolutions are not explored in this paper, which should be a future research direction of designing dynamic short-convolutional components according to the input data. Moreover, the time-varying SSM is a different idea to achieve this goal. By embracing CHELA as a starting point in the integration of hardware-efficient implementation into hybrid models, we are taking the initial step towards achieving greater efficiency gains in the future. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China (No. 2021YFA1301603), National Natural Science Foundation of China Project (No. U21A20427), Project (No. WU2022A009) from the Center of Synthetic Biology and Integrated Bioengineering of Westlake University and Project (No. WU2023C019) from the Westlake University Industries of the Future Research Funding.

We have considered broader ethical impacts and do not foresee CHELA directly leading to negative societal consequences. All datasets and models used are existing public resources that do not contain private or sensitive information. Through discussing the hybrid design of linear attention and SSM models, we aim to make sequence mixers much more efficient by fully leveraging hardware and different model features. Besides, as the community proposes new methods, we encourage discussing any potential negative impacts early in the research process. Overall, we believe hardware-efficient style and the combination of structured and data-dependent patterns are the dominant trends of the future for efficient sequence modeling. ## References\n\nAinslie, J., Ontanon, S., Alberti, C., Cvicek, V., Fisher, Z., Pham, P., Ravula, A., Sanghai, S., Wang, Q., and Yang, L.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 4. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.83)\n\n*Haoran You, Yichao Fu, Zheng Wang, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Y.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

The main ideas include introducing grouped-value attention (GVA) head structure, and moving all data-dependent projections to occur in parallel at the beginning of the block. The combination of the modified parallel Mamba block, together with using SSD as the inner SSM layer, results in the Mamba-2 architecture. We investigate Chinchilla scaling laws for Mamba-2 in the same setting as Mamba, finding that it Pareto dominates Mamba and Transformer++ in both perplexity and wall-clock time. We additionally train a family of\n\nMamba-2 models at varying sizes on the Pile, showing that it matches or outperforms Mamba and open source Transformers on standard downstream evaluations. For example, Mamba-2 with 2.7B parameters trained on 300B tokens on the Pile outperforms Mamba-2.8B, Pythia-2.8B and even Pythia-6.9B trained on the same dataset. Systems Optimizations. The SSD framework connects SSMs and Transformers, allowing us to leverage a rich body of work on systems optimizations developed for Transformers (Section 8). - For example, Tensor Parallelism (TP) is an important model parallelism technique to train large Transformer models by splitting each layer across GPUs on the same node. We design Mamba-2 to be TP-friendly, reducing the number of synchronization point per block by half. - For very long sequences whose activations do not fit on one device, sequence parallelism has been developed for the attention blocks. We describe how to train SSMs in general and Mamba-2 in particular with sequence parallelism, by passing the recurrent states between devices. - For finetuning with examples of different lengths, for best efficiency, Transformer requires sophisticated techniques to remove padding tokens and perform attention on variable length sequences. We show how Mamba-2 can be trained with variable sequence lengths efficiently, requiring no padding tokens. Section 9 empirically validates Mamba-2 on language modeling, training efficiency, and a difficult multi-query associative recall task (Arora, Eyuboglu, Zhang, et al. 2024). Finally, in Section 10, we provide an extended related work and discuss potential research directions opened up by our framework. Model code and pre-trained checkpoints are open-sourced at https://github.com/state-spaces/mamba. ## 2 Background and Overview\n\n### 2.1 Structured State Space Models\n\nStructured state space sequence models (S4) are a recent class of sequence models for deep learning that are broadly related to RNNs, CNNs, and classical state space models. They are inspired by a particular continuous system (1) that maps a 1-dimensional sequence $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top}$ through an implicit latent state $h \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, N)}$. A general discrete form of structured SSMs takes the form of equation (1). $$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A h_{t-1}+B x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& h_{t}=A_{t} h_{t-1}+B_{t} x_{t} \\\\\n& y_{t}=C_{t}^{\\top} h_{t}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, N)}, B \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}, C \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(N, 1)}$. Structured SSMs are so named because the $A$ matrix controlling the temporal dynamics must be structured in order to compute this sequence-to-sequence transformation efficiently enough to be used in deep neural networks. The original structures introduced were diagonal plus low-rank (DPLR) (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022) and diagonal (Gu, Gupta, et al. 2022; Gupta, Gu, and Berant 2022; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), which remains the most popular structure. In this work, we use the term state space model (SSM) to refer to structured SSMs. There are many flavors of such SSMs, with deep ties to several major paradigms of neural sequence models such as continuous-time, recurrent, and convolutional models (Gu, Johnson, Goel, et al. 2021). We provide a brief overview below, and refer to prior work for more context and details (Gu 2023; Gu and Dao 2023). Continuous-time Models. The original structured SSMs originated as continuous-time maps on functions $x(t) \\in \\mathbb{R} \\mapsto$ $y(t) \\in \\mathbb{R}$, rather than operating directly on sequences. In the continuous-time perspective, in equation (1a) the matrices $(A, B)$ are not directly learned but generated from underlying parameters $(\\AA, B)$, along with a parameterized step size $\\Delta$. The \"continuous parameters\" $(\\Delta, \\AA, B)$ are converted to \"discrete parameters\" $(A, B)$ through fixed formulas $A=f_{A}(\\Delta, \\AA)$ and $B=f_{B}(\\Delta, B)$, where the pair $\\left(f_{A}, f_{B}\\right)$ is called a discretization rule. Remark 1. While our main models adopt the same parameterization and discretization step as prior work (see Gu and Dao (2023) for details), for simplifying exposition and notation we omit it in the rest of this paper. We note that prior work on\nstructured SSMs referred to the continuous parameters $(\\AA$, have changed notation to simplify the presentation and focus directly on the discrete parameters, which govern the main SSM recurrence. Recurrent Models. Equations (1) and (2) take the form of a recurrence which is linear in its input $x$. Structured SSMs can therefore be viewed as types of recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the linearity endows them with additional properties and allows them to avoid the sequential computation of traditional RNNs. Conversely, despite this simplification, SSMs are still fully expressive as sequence transformations (in the sense of universal approximation) (Kaul 2020; Orvieto et al. 2023; Shida Wang and Xue 2023). Convolutional Models. When the SSM's dynamics are constant through time as in equation (1), the model is called linear time-invariant (LTI). In this case, they are equivalent to convolutions. Thus, SSMs can also be viewed as types of CNNs, but where (i) the convolution kernels are implicitly parameterized through the SSM parameters $(A, B, C)$ and (ii) the convolution kernels are generally global instead of local. Conversely, through classical signal processing theory all sufficiently well-behaved convolutions can be represented as SSMs. Commonly, previous LTI SSMs would use the convolutional mode for efficient parallelizable training (where the whole input sequence is seen ahead of time), and switched into recurrent mode (1) for efficient autoregressive inference (where the inputs are seen one step at a time). Selective State Space Models. The form (2) where the parameters $(A, B, C)$ can also vary in time was introduced in Mamba as the selective SSM. Compared to the standard LTI formulation (1), this model can selectively choose to focus on or ignore inputs at every timestep. It was shown to perform much better than LTI SSMs on information-dense data such as language, especially as its state size N increases allowing for more information capacity. However, it can only be computed in recurrent instead of convolutional mode, and requires a careful hardware-aware implementation to be efficient. Even so, it is still less efficient than hardware-friendly models such as CNNs and Transformers because it does not leverage matrix multiplication units, which modern accelerators such as GPUs and TPUs are specialized for. While time-invariant SSMs are closely related to continuous, recurrent, and convolutional sequence models, they are not directly related to attention. In this paper, we show a deeper relationship between selective SSMs and attention, and use it to significantly improve the training speed of SSMs while simultaneously allowing for much larger state sizes N . ## Structured SSMs as Sequence Transformations. Definition 2.1. We use the term sequence transformation to refer to a parameterized map on sequences $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ where $X, Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ and $\\theta$ is an arbitrary collection of parameters. T represents the sequence or time axis; subscripts index into the first dimension, e.g. $X_{t}, Y_{t} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{P}$. Sequence transformations (e.g. SSMs, or self-attention) are the cornerstone of deep sequence models, where they are incorporated into neural network architectures (e.g. Transformers). The SSM in (1) or (2) is a sequence transformation with $P=1$; it can be generalized to $P>1$ by simply broadcasting across this dimension (in other words, viewing the input as $P$ independent sequences and applying the SSM to each). One can think of $P$ as a head dimension, which we will elaborate on in Section 7. Definition 2.2. We define the SSM operator $\\operatorname{SSM}(A, B, C)=\\operatorname{SSM}\\left(A_{0: T}, B_{0: T}, C_{0: T}\\right)$ as the sequence transformation $X \\in$ $\\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})} \\mapsto Y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{P})}$ defined by equation (2). In SSMs, the $N$ dimension is a free parameter called the state size or state dimension. We also call it the state expansion factor, because it expands the size of the input/output by a factor of $N$, with implications for the computational efficiency of these models. Finally, we remark that many types of sequence transformations, such as attention, can be represented as a single matrix multiplication across the sequence dimension. Definition 2.3. We call a sequence transformation $Y=f_{\\theta}(X)$ a matrix transformation if it can be written in the form $Y=M_{\\theta} X$ where $M$ is a matrix depending on the parameters $\\theta$. We identify the sequence transformation with the matrix $M$, and often drop the dependence on $\\theta$ when clear from context. ### 2.2 Attention\n\nAttention broadly refers to a type of computation that assigns scores to every pair of positions in a sequence, allowing each element to \"attend\" to the rest. By far the most common and important variant of attention is softmax self-attention, which can be defined as\n\n$$\nY=\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V\n$$\n\nfor $Q, K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\top, \\mathrm{P})}$. The mechanism of pairwise comparisons (induced by materializing $Q K^{\\top}$ ) leads to the characteristic quadratic training cost of attention. Many variants of attention have been proposed, but all share the underlying core of these attention scores, with various approximations (Tay et al. 2022). The most important variant for this work is linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Roughly speaking, this family of methods drops the softmax by folding it into a kernel feature map, and uses associativity of matrix multiplication to rewrite $\\left(Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V=Q \\cdot\\left(K^{\\top} V\\right)$. Moreover, in the important case of causal (autoregressive) attention, they show that when the causal mask is incorporated into the left-hand side as $\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V$, where $L$ is the lower-triangular 1's matrix, then the right-hand side can be expanded as a recurrence.\n```\n\n#### 5.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Hierarchical State Space Models, Linear Attention State Space Models, Mamba DenseMamba CHELA SSM\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 3 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

Prior generative approaches which decode slot values sequentially do not generalize well to variations in schema, while discriminative approaches separately encode history and schema and fail to account for inter-slot and intent-slot dependencies. We introduce SPLAT, a novel architecture which achieves better generalization and efficiency than prior approaches by constraining outputs to a limited prediction space. At the same time, our model allows for rich attention among descriptions and history while keeping computation costs constrained by incorporating linear-time attention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) and MultiWOZ datasets. Our approach significantly improves upon existing models achieving 85.3 JGA on the SGD dataset. Further, we show increased robustness on the SGD-X benchmark: our model outperforms the more than 30x larger D3ST-XXL model by 5.0 points.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

The goal is to enhance comprehension\nof these models by analyzing the impact of each component from a cohesive and\nstreamlined viewpoint. Specifically, we segment the modeling processes of these\nmodels into three distinct stages: Expand, Oscillation, and Shrink (EOS), with\neach model having its own specific settings. The Expand stage involves\nprojecting the input signal onto a high-dimensional memory state. This is\nfollowed by recursive operations performed on the memory state in the\nOscillation stage. Finally, the memory state is projected back to a\nlow-dimensional space in the Shrink stage. We perform comprehensive experiments\nto analyze the impact of different stage settings on language modeling and\nretrieval tasks. Our results show that data-driven methods are crucial for the\neffectiveness of the three stages in language modeling, whereas hand-crafted\nmethods yield better performance in retrieval tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-27T17:38:55Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-27T17:38:55Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Mega: Moving Average Equipped Gated Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention State Space Models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Jonathan May, Graham Neubig, Liangke Gui, Junxian He, Xiang Kong, Chunting Zhou, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** The design choices in the Transformer attention mechanism, including weak inductive bias and quadratic computational complexity, have limited its application for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we introduce Mega, a simple, theoretically grounded, single-head gated attention mechanism equipped with (exponential) moving average to incorporate inductive bias of position-aware local dependencies into the position-agnostic attention mechanism. We further propose a variant of Mega that offers linear time and space complexity yet yields only minimal quality loss, by efficiently splitting the whole sequence into multiple chunks with fixed length. Extensive experiments on a wide range of sequence modeling benchmarks, including the Long Range Arena, neural machine translation, auto-regressive language modeling, and image and speech classification, show that Mega achieves significant improvements over other sequence models, including variants of Transformers and recent state space models.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-21\n\n\n\n#### 4. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: Linear Attention State Space Models*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the proposed **HierarchicalStateLinearAttention (HSLA)**, here are the key points and useful information that need to be focused on:\n\n## Novelty and Originality\n\n- The researcher needs to verify whether HSLA offers novel contributions beyond existing models like **Mamba**, **DenseMamba**, and **CHELA**.

Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters. To ensure a real-world\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-15.jpg?height=446&width=859&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=596)\n\nFigure 10. Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

A promising alternative is Mamba, which demonstrates high performance and achieves Transformer-level capabilities while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. In this paper we explore the length-generalization capabilities of Mamba, which we find to be relatively limited. Through a series of visualizations and analyses we identify that the limitations arise from a restricted effective receptive field, dictated by the sequence length used during training. To address this constraint, we introduce DeciMamba, a context-extension method specifically designed for Mamba. This mechanism, built on top of a hidden filtering mechanism embedded within the S6 layer, enables the trained model to extrapolate well even without additional training. Empirical experiments over real-world long-range NLP tasks show that DeciMamba can extrapolate to context lengths that are 25x times longer than the ones seen during training, and does so without utilizing additional computational resources. We will release our code and models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/27 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nYue Liu, Yunjie Tian, Yuzhong Zhao, Hongtian Yu, Lingxi Xie, Yaowei Wang, Qixiang Ye, and Yunfan Liu. 2024b.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this work, we propose a hierarchical attention prototypical networks (HAPN) for few-shot text classification. We design the feature level, word level, and instance level multi cross attention for our model to enhance the expressive ability of semantic space, so it can highlight or weaken the importance of the features, words, and instances separately. We verify the effectiveness of our model on two standard benchmark few-shot text classification datasets\u2014FewRel and CSID, and achieve the state-of-the-art performance. The visualization of hierarchical attention layers illustrates that our model can capture more important features, words, and instances.

Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE is proposed, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learn.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

They predict linearized graphs as free texts, avoiding explicit structure modeling. However, this simplicity neglects structural locality in AMR graphs and introduces unnecessary tokens to represent coreferences. In this paper, we introduce new target forms of AMR parsing and a novel model, CHAP, which is equipped with causal hierarchical attention and the pointer mechanism, enabling the integration of structures into the Transformer decoder. We empirically explore various alternative modeling options.

Polynormer: Polynomial-Expressive Graph Transformer in Linear Time\n\n*From Search Query: Novel Integration SSMs Linear Attention*\n\n*Chenhui Deng, Zichao Yue, Zhiru Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Polynormer is a polynomial-expressive GT model with linear complexity built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features, which outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomial-expressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on $13$ homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models Attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Da-Cheng Juan, Ines Chami, Frederic Sala, Adva Wolf, Sujith Ravi*\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean- and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attention-based transformations generalize to multiple relations. In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10.\n\n**Conference:** low-dimensional-hyperbolic-knowledge-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. HAHE: Hierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous Information Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models Attention*\n\n*Jia-Wei Chen, Sheng Zhou, Jiajun Bu, Xin Wang, Can Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Heterogeneous information network (HIN) embedding has recently attracted much attention due to its effectiveness in dealing with the complex heterogeneous data. Meta path, which connects different object types with various semantic meanings, is widely used by existing HIN embedding works. However, several challenges have not been addressed so far. First, different meta paths convey different semantic meanings, while existing works assume that all nodes share same weights for meta paths and ignore the personalized preferences of different nodes on different meta paths. Second, given a meta path, nodes in HIN are connected by path instances while existing works fail to fully explore the differences between path instances that reflect nodes' preferences in the semantic space. rTo tackle the above challenges, we propose aHierarchical Attentive Heterogeneous information network Embedding (HAHE) model to capture the personalized preferences on meta paths and path instances in each semantic space. As path instances are based on a particular meta path, a hierarchical attention mechanism is naturally utilized to model the personalized preference on meta paths and path instances. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our proposed \\model model significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of various data mining tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. MedMamba: Vision Mamba for Medical Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Novel Integration SSMs Linear Attention*\n\n*Zhenzhang Li, Yubiao Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the era of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViTs) have been extensively studied and widely used in medical image classification tasks. Unfortunately, CNN's limitations in modeling long-range dependencies result in poor classification performances. In contrast, ViTs are hampered by the quadratic computational complexity of their self-attention mechanism, making them difficult to deploy in real-world settings with limited computational resources. Recent studies have shown that state space models (SSMs) represented by Mamba can effectively model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity. Inspired by it, we proposed MedMamba, the first Vision Mamba for generalized medical image classification. Concretely, we introduced a novel hybrid basic block named SS-Conv-SSM, which purely integrates the convolutional layers for extracting local features with the abilities of SSM to capture long-range dependencies, aiming to model medical images from different image modalities efficiently. By employing the grouped convolution strategy and channel-shuffle operation, MedMamba successfully provides fewer model parameters and a lower computational burden for efficient applications without sacrificing accuracy. We thoroughly evaluated MedMamba using 16 datasets containing ten imaging modalities and 411,007 images. Experimental results show that MedMamba demonstrates competitive performance on most tasks compared with the state-of-the-art methods. This work aims to explore the potential of Vision Mamba and establish a new baseline for medical image classification, thereby providing valuable insights for developing more powerful Mamba-based artificial intelligence algorithms and applications in medicine.

MHS-VM: Multi-Head Scanning in Parallel Subspaces for Vision Mamba\n\n*From Search Query: Novel Integration SSMs Linear Attention*\n\n*Zhongping Ji*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, State Space Models (SSMs), with Mamba as a prime example, have shown great promise for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. Then, Vision Mamba and the subsequent architectures are presented successively, and they perform well on visual tasks. The crucial step of applying Mamba to visual tasks is to construct 2D visual features in sequential manners. To effectively organize and construct visual features within the 2D image space through 1D selective scan, we propose a novel Multi-Head Scan (MHS) module. The embeddings extracted from the preceding layer are projected into multiple lower-dimensional subspaces. Subsequently, within each subspace, the selective scan is performed along distinct scan routes. The resulting sub-embeddings, obtained from the multi-head scan process, are then integrated and ultimately projected back into the high-dimensional space. Moreover, we incorporate a Scan Route Attention (SRA) mechanism to enhance the module's capability to discern complex structures. To validate the efficacy of our module, we exclusively substitute the 2D-Selective-Scan (SS2D) block in VM-UNet with our proposed module, and we train our models from scratch without using any pre-trained weights.
