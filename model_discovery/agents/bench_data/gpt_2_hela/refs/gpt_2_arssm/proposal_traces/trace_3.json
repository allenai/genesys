Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 0.67)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 46/51 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

However, the improvement strategies for attention mechanisms typically necessitate extensive retraining, which is impractical for large language models with a vast array of parameters. In this paper, we present DiJiang, a novel Frequency Domain Kernelization approach that enables the transformation of a pre-trained vanilla Transformer into a linear complexity model with little training costs. By employing a weighted Quasi-Monte Carlo method for sampling, the proposed approach theoretically offers superior approximation efficiency. To further reduce the training computational complexity, our kernelization is based on Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) operations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves comparable performance to the original Transformer, but with significantly reduced training costs and much faster inference speeds. Our DiJiang-7B achieves comparable performance with LLaMA2-7B on various benchmark while requires only about 1/50 training cost.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.59)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.36)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2401.10166, 2024b.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I. Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. An Adaptive Kernel Approach to Federated Learning of Heterogeneous Causal Effects\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive kernel learning*\n\n*Thanh Vinh Vo, Arnab Bhattacharyya, Young Lee, T. Leong*\n\n**TL;DR:** An adaptive transfer algorithm that learns the similarities among the data sources by utilizing Random Fourier Features to disentangle the loss function into multiple components, each of which is associated with a data source.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new causal inference framework to learn causal effects from multiple, decentralized data sources in a federated setting. We introduce an adaptive transfer algorithm that learns the similarities among the data sources by utilizing Random Fourier Features to disentangle the loss function into multiple components, each of which is associated with a data source. The data sources may have different distributions; the causal effects are independently and systematically incorporated. The proposed method estimates the similarities among the sources through transfer coefficients, and hence requiring no prior information about the similarity measures. The heterogeneous causal effects can be estimated with no sharing of the raw training data among the sources, thus minimizing the risk of privacy leak. We also provide minimax lower bounds to assess the quality of the parameters learned from the disparate sources. The proposed method is empirically shown to outperform the baselines on decentralized data sources with dissimilar distributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Second-Order Online Kernel Learning with Adaptive Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive kernel learning*\n\n*Daniele Calandriello, A. Lazaric, Michal Valko*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes PROS-N-KONS, a method that combines Nystrom sketching to project the input point in a small, accurate embedded space, and performs efficient second-order updates in this space and achieves the logarithmic regret.\n\n**Abstract:** Online kernel learning (OKL) is a flexible framework to approach prediction problems, since the large approximation space provided by reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces can contain an accurate function for the problem. Nonetheless, optimizing over this space is computationally expensive. Not only first order methods accumulate $\\O(\\sqrt{T})$ more loss than the optimal function, but the curse of kernelization results in a $\\O(t)$ per step complexity. Second-order methods get closer to the optimum much faster, suffering only $\\O(\\log(T))$ regret, but second-order updates are even more expensive, with a $\\O(t^2)$ per-step cost. Existing approximate OKL methods try to reduce this complexity either by limiting the Support Vectors (SV) introduced in the predictor, or by avoiding the kernelization process altogether using embedding. Nonetheless, as long as the size of the approximation space or the number of SV does not grow over time, an adversary can always exploit the approximation process. In this paper, we propose PROS-N-KONS, a method that combines Nystrom sketching to project the input point in a small, accurate embedded space, and performs efficient second-order updates in this space. The embedded space is continuously updated to guarantee that the embedding remains accurate, and we show that the per-step cost only grows with the effective dimension of the problem and not with $T$. Moreover, the second-order updated allows us to achieve the logarithmic regret. We empirically compare our algorithm on recent large-scales benchmarks and show it performs favorably.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 4. Wavelet Feature Maps Compression for Image-to-Image CNNs\n\n*From Search Query: efficient feature maps*\n\n*Shahaf E. Finder, Yair Zohav, Maor Ashkenazi, Eran Treister*\n\n**TL;DR:** Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) is proposed -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are known for requiring extensive computational resources, and quantization is among the best and most common methods for compressing them. While aggressive quantization (i.e., less than 4-bits) performs well for classification, it may cause severe performance degradation in image-to-image tasks such as semantic segmentation and depth estimation. In this paper, we propose Wavelet Compressed Convolution (WCC) -- a novel approach for high-resolution activation maps compression integrated with point-wise convolutions, which are the main computational cost of modern architectures. To this end, we use an efficient and hardware-friendly Haar-wavelet transform, known for its effectiveness in image compression, and define the convolution on the compressed activation map. We experiment with various tasks that benefit from high-resolution input. By combining WCC with light quantization, we achieve compression rates equivalent to 1-4bit activation quantization with relatively small and much more graceful degradation in performance.

Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets\n\n*From Search Query: efficient feature maps*\n\n*Hao Li, Asim Kadav, Igor Durdanovic, H. Samet, H. Graf*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents an acceleration method for CNNs, where it is shown that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.\n\n**Abstract:** The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward reducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers without hurting original accuracy. However, magnitude-based pruning of weights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected layers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional layers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an acceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are identified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole filters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the computation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights, this approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does not need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing efficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even simple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to 34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the original accuracy by retraining the networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 3451  (*Influential: 642*)\n\n#### 6. Kaleidoscope: An Efficient, Learnable Representation For All Structured Linear Maps\n\n*From Search Query: efficient feature maps*\n\n*Tri Dao, N. Sohoni, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, Amit Blonder, Megan Leszczynski, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** A family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) are introduced that provably capture any structured matrix with near-optimal space (parameter) and time (arithmetic operation) complexity that can be automatically learned within end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern neural network architectures use structured linear transformations, such as low-rank matrices, sparse matrices, permutations, and the Fourier transform, to improve inference speed and reduce memory usage compared to general linear maps. However, choosing which of the myriad structured transformations to use (and its associated parameterization) is a laborious task that requires trading off speed, space, and accuracy. We consider a different approach: we introduce a family of matrices called kaleidoscope matrices (K-matrices) that provably capture any structured matrix with near-optimal space (parameter) and time (arithmetic operation) complexity. We empirically validate that K-matrices can be automatically learned within end-to-end pipelines to replace hand-crafted procedures, in order to improve model quality. For example, replacing channel shuffles in ShuffleNet improves classification accuracy on ImageNet by up to 5%. Learnable K-matrices can also simplify hand-engineered pipelines---we replace filter bank feature computation in speech data preprocessing with a kaleidoscope layer, resulting in only 0.4% loss in accuracy on the TIMIT speech recognition task. K-matrices can also capture latent structure in models: for a challenging permuted image classification task, adding a K-matrix to a standard convolutional architecture can enable learning the latent permutation and improve accuracy by over 8 points. We provide a practically efficient implementation of our approach, and use K-matrices in a Transformer network to attain 36% faster end-to-end inference speed on a language translation task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Meta-learning Adaptive Deep Kernel Gaussian Processes for Molecular Property Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive kernel learning*\n\n*Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato, Austin Tripp, Wenlin Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Adaptive Deep Kernel Fitting with Implicit Function Theorem (ADKF-IFT), a novel framework for learning deep kernel Gaussian processes (GPs) by interpolating between meta-learning and conventional deep kernel learning. Our approach employs a bilevel optimization objective where we meta-learn generally useful feature representations across tasks, in the sense that task-specific GP models estimated on top of such features achieve the lowest possible predictive loss on average. We solve the resulting nested optimization problem using the implicit function theorem (IFT). We show that our ADKF-IFT framework contains previously proposed Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) and Deep Kernel Transfer (DKT) as special cases. Although ADKF-IFT is a completely general method, we argue that it is especially well-suited for drug discovery problems and demonstrate that it significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on a variety of real-world few-shot molecular property prediction tasks and out-of-domain molecular property prediction and optimization tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-05\n\n\n\n#### 4. Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive kernel learning*\n\n*Jure Leskovec, Vijay Pande, Percy Liang, Bowen Liu, Marinka Zitnik, Joseph Gomes, Weihua Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Many applications of machine learning require a model to make accurate pre-dictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training ones, while task-specific labels are scarce during training. An effective approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations simultaneously. We systematically study pre-training on multiple graph classification datasets. We find that naive strategies, which pre-train GNNs at the level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvement and can even lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks. In contrast, our strategy avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for molecular property prediction and protein function prediction.\n\n**Conference:** strategies-for-pre-training-graph-neural\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-29\n\n\n\n#### 5.

One version of our method, which we call checkered subsampling, significantly improves the accuracy of state-of-the-art architectures such as DenseNet and ResNet without any additional parameters and, remarkably, improves the accuracy of certain pretrained ImageNet models without any training or fine-tuning. We glean possible insight into the nature of data augmentations and demonstrate experimentally that coarse feature maps are bottlenecking the performance of neural networks in image classification.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. Exploring Map-based Features for Efficient Attention-based Vehicle Motion Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: efficient feature maps*\n\n*Miguel Ortiz, Marcos V. Conde, Carlos G\u00f3mez-Hu\u00e9lamo*\n\n**Abstract:** Motion prediction (MP) of multiple agents is a crucial task in arbitrarily complex environments, from social robots to self-driving cars. Current approaches tackle this problem using end-to-end networks, where the input data is usually a rendered top-view of the scene and the past trajectories of all the agents; leveraging this information is a must to obtain optimal performance. In that sense, a reliable Autonomous Driving (AD) system must produce reasonable predictions on time, however, despite many of these approaches use simple ConvNets and LSTMs, models might not be efficient enough for real-time applications when using both sources of information (map and trajectory history). Moreover, the performance of these models highly depends on the amount of training data, which can be expensive (particularly the annotated HD maps). In this work, we explore how to achieve competitive performance on the Argoverse 1.0 Benchmark using efficient attention-based models, which take as input the past trajectories and map-based features from minimal map information to ensure efficient and reliable MP. These features represent interpretable information as the driveable area and plausible goal points, in opposition to black-box CNN-based methods for map processing.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve autoregressive language model design using the specified keywords and details, here are some relevant insights and directions from the available sources and the analysis provided:\n\n### Hierarchical Decomposition Methods in State Space Models and Their Application to Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The concept of hierarchical decomposition in state space models is crucial for efficiently modeling multi-scale temporal dependencies. The paper on \"SC-MAMBA2\" discusses the use of state space models and introduces the idea of \"State Space Duality\" which simplifies the matrix transformations, potentially allowing for hierarchical decomposition. This approach could be adapted to attention mechanisms to capture complex contextual relationships more efficiently.\n\n- The idea of hierarchical decomposition can be integrated into linear attention mechanisms to better capture multi-scale dependencies. For instance, using a hierarchical structure in the feature maps of linear attention could help in modeling both short-term and long-term dependencies effectively.\n\n### Efficient Approaches to Adaptive Kernel Learning That Maintain Linear Complexity\n\n- Current adaptive kernel learning methods in transformers are often computationally expensive. However, the need for efficient adaptive kernel learning that maintains linear complexity is highlighted. While the provided sources do not directly address this, the concept of learnable kernel functions that adapt to input patterns, as mentioned in \"Adaptive Kernel Transformers,\" suggests that there is ongoing research in this area. Researchers could explore discretization techniques and parameter transformations similar to those used in state space models to achieve efficient adaptive kernel learning.\n\n- The use of convolutional kernels in state space models, as seen in the SC-MAMBA2 paper, could be a starting point for developing efficient adaptive kernel methods. By ensuring that the kernel learning process is input-independent or uses efficient discretization, it might be possible to maintain linear complexity.\n\n### Novel Feature Map Designs for Linear Attention That Improve Expressiveness\n\n- The limitation of current feature maps in linear attention in capturing fine-grained dependencies is a significant challenge. Novel feature map designs could leverage insights from state space models and hierarchical decomposition. For example, the BiMamba module in SC-MAMBA2, which processes sequences in both forward and backward directions, could inspire new feature map architectures that capture bidirectional contextual relationships more effectively.\n\n- The use of adaptive pixel weighting mechanisms, as seen in the Capsule Attention Network (CAN) for hyperspectral image classification, could be adapted to linear attention. This involves weighting features in an adaptive way to gather useful information, which could enhance the expressiveness of feature maps in linear attention models.\n\n### Summary and Future Directions\n\n- **Hierarchical State Space Models**: Investigate how hierarchical decomposition in state space models can be applied to linear attention mechanisms to capture multi-scale dependencies efficiently.\n- **Adaptive Kernel Learning**: Explore methods to adapt kernel functions in linear attention while maintaining linear complexity, potentially using discretization and parameter transformation techniques from state space models.\n- **Novel Feature Map Designs**: Develop feature map architectures inspired by bidirectional processing in state space models and adaptive weighting mechanisms to improve the expressiveness of linear attention.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can design more efficient, expressive, and scalable autoregressive language models that outperform existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 16 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: structured state space models, efficient adaptive mechanisms, hardware optimization patterns\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Structured State Space Models for In-Context Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models*\n\n*Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yannick Schroecker, Albert Gu, Emilio Parisotto, J. Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models*\n\n*Paul Mattes, Rainer Schlosser, R. Herbrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hieros is a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space that allows for more efficient training than RNN- based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Chen Huang, Walter A. Talbott, N. Jaitly, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, this paper learns to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer, and makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise attention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Multi-Epoch Matrix Factorization Mechanisms for Private Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Christopher A. Choquette-Choo, H. B.

We formalize the problem of DP mechanisms for adaptive streams with multiple participations and introduce a non-trivial extension of online matrix factorization DP mechanisms to our setting. This includes establishing the necessary theory for sensitivity calculations and efficient computation of optimal matrices. For some applications like $>\\!\\! 10,000$ SGD steps, applying these optimal techniques becomes computationally expensive. We thus design an efficient Fourier-transform-based mechanism with only a minor utility loss. Extensive empirical evaluation on both example-level DP for image classification and user-level DP for language modeling demonstrate substantial improvements over all previous methods, including the widely-used DP-SGD . Though our primary application is to ML, our main DP results are applicable to arbitrary linear queries and hence may have much broader applicability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. GeminiFusion: Efficient Pixel-wise Multimodal Fusion for Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Ding Jia, Jianyuan Guo, Kai Han, Han Wu, Chao Zhang, Chang Xu, Xinghao Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper first critiques prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal features, and demonstrates exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms, while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Cross-modal transformers have demonstrated superiority in various vision tasks by effectively integrating different modalities. This paper first critiques prior token exchange methods which replace less informative tokens with inter-modal features, and demonstrate exchange based methods underperform cross-attention mechanisms, while the computational demand of the latter inevitably restricts its use with longer sequences. To surmount the computational challenges, we propose GeminiFusion, a pixel-wise fusion approach that capitalizes on aligned cross-modal representations. GeminiFusion elegantly combines intra-modal and inter-modal attentions, dynamically integrating complementary information across modalities. We employ a layer-adaptive noise to adaptively control their interplay on a per-layer basis, thereby achieving a harmonized fusion process. Notably, GeminiFusion maintains linear complexity with respect to the number of input tokens, ensuring this multimodal framework operates with efficiency comparable to unimodal networks. Comprehensive evaluations across multimodal image-to-image translation, 3D object detection and arbitrary-modal semantic segmentation tasks, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, event data, etc. demonstrate the superior performance of our GeminiFusion against leading-edge techniques.

Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization patterns*\n\n*Aviral Kumar, A. Yazdanbakhsh, Milad Hashemi, Kevin Swersky, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a\"simulation-driven\"approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a\"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. Deep Graph Representation Learning and Optimization for Influence Maximization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization patterns*\n\n*Chen Ling, Junji Jiang, Junxiang Wang, M.

Qiu, Liang Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework DeepIM is designed to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Influence maximization (IM) is formulated as selecting a set of initial users from a social network to maximize the expected number of influenced users. Researchers have made great progress in designing various traditional methods, and their theoretical design and performance gain are close to a limit. In the past few years, learning-based IM methods have emerged to achieve stronger generalization ability to unknown graphs than traditional ones. However, the development of learning-based IM methods is still limited by fundamental obstacles, including 1) the difficulty of effectively solving the objective function; 2) the difficulty of characterizing the diversified underlying diffusion patterns; and 3) the difficulty of adapting the solution under various node-centrality-constrained IM variants. To cope with the above challenges, we design a novel framework DeepIM to generatively characterize the latent representation of seed sets, and we propose to learn the diversified information diffusion pattern in a data-driven and end-to-end manner. Finally, we design a novel objective function to infer optimal seed sets under flexible node-centrality-based budget constraints.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization patterns*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Enhanced Structured State Space Models via Grouped FIR Filtering and\n  Attention Sink Mechanisms\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models*\n\n*Tian Meng, Yang Tao, Wuliang Yin*\n\n**Abstract:** Structured State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as compelling alternatives\nto Transformer architectures, offering linear-time complexity and superior\nperformance in various sequence modeling tasks. Despite their advantages, SSMs\nlike the original Mamba-2 face training difficulties due to the sensitivities\nintroduced by the extended series of recurrent matrix multiplications. In this\npaper, we propose an advanced architecture that mitigates these challenges by\ndecomposing A-multiplications into multiple groups and optimizing positional\nencoding through Grouped Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filtering. This new\nstructure, denoted as Grouped FIR-enhanced SSM (GFSSM), employs semiseparable\nmatrices for efficient computation. Furthermore, inspired by the \"attention\nsink\" phenomenon identified in streaming language models, we incorporate a\nsimilar mechanism to enhance the stability and performance of our model over\nextended sequences.

Recursion in Recursion: Two-Level Nested Recursion for Length\n  Generalization with Scalability\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models*\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Abstract:** Binary Balanced Tree RvNNs (BBT-RvNNs) enforce sequence composition according\nto a preset balanced binary tree structure. Thus, their non-linear recursion\ndepth is just $\\log_2 n$ ($n$ being the sequence length). Such logarithmic\nscaling makes BBT-RvNNs efficient and scalable on long sequence tasks such as\nLong Range Arena (LRA). However, such computational efficiency comes at a cost\nbecause BBT-RvNNs cannot solve simple arithmetic tasks like ListOps. On the\nflip side, RvNNs (e.g., Beam Tree RvNN) that do succeed on ListOps (and other\nstructure-sensitive tasks like formal logical inference) are generally several\ntimes more expensive than even RNNs. In this paper, we introduce a novel\nframework -- Recursion in Recursion (RIR) to strike a balance between the two\nsides - getting some of the benefits from both worlds. In RIR, we use a form of\ntwo-level nested recursion - where the outer recursion is a $k$-ary balanced\ntree model with another recursive model (inner recursion) implementing its cell\nfunction. For the inner recursion, we choose Beam Tree RvNNs (BT-RvNN). To\nadjust BT-RvNNs within RIR we also propose a novel strategy of beam alignment.\nOverall, this entails that the total recursive depth in RIR is upper-bounded by\n$k \\log_k n$. Our best RIR-based model is the first model that demonstrates\nhigh ($\\geq 90\\%$) length-generalization performance on ListOps while at the\nsame time being scalable enough to be trainable on long sequence inputs from\nLRA. Moreover, in terms of accuracy in the LRA language tasks, it performs\ncompetitively with Structured State Space Models (SSMs) without any special\ninitialization - outperforming Transformers by a large margin. On the other\nhand, while SSMs can marginally outperform RIR on LRA, they (SSMs) fail to\nlength-generalize on ListOps.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: structured state space models*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Adaptive schemes provide a the ability to guide the experiment yielding new sample point positions to enrich the metamodel.

The performance of the innovative approach is tested for analytical functions as well as some mechanical problems and is furthermore compared to two regression-based adaptive schemes. For smooth problems, all three methods have comparable performances. For highly fluctuating response surface as encountered e.g. for dynamics or damage problems, the innovative MiVor algorithm performs very well and provides accurate binary classification with only a few observation points.\n\n**Published:** 2019-07-02\n\n\n\n#### 4. Octopus Inspired Optimization Algorithm: Multi-Level Structures and Parallel Computing Strategies\n\n*From Search Query: efficient adaptive mechanisms*\n\n*Rui He, Jia Deng, Xiang Li, Yuhua Dong, Yiquan Wang, Longji Xu, Xu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a novel bionic intelligent optimisation algorithm, Octopus Inspired Optimization (OIO) algorithm, which is inspired by the neural structure of octopus, especially its hierarchical and decentralised interaction properties. By simulating the sensory, decision-making, and executive abilities of octopuses, the OIO algorithm adopts a multi-level hierarchical strategy, including tentacles, suckers, individuals and groups, to achieve an effective combination of global and local search. This hierarchical design not only enhances the flexibility and efficiency of the algorithm, but also significantly improves its search efficiency and adaptability. In performance evaluations, including comparisons with existing mainstream intelligent optimisation algorithms, OIO shows faster convergence and higher accuracy, especially when dealing with multimodal functions and high-dimensional optimisation problems. This advantage is even more pronounced as the required minimum accuracy is higher, with the OIO algorithm showing an average speedup of 2.27 times that of conventional particle swarm optimisation (PSO) and 9.63 times that of differential evolution (DE) on multimodal functions. In particular, when dealing with high-dimensional optimisation problems, OIO achieves an average speed of 10.39 times that of DE, demonstrating its superior computational efficiency. In addition, the OIO algorithm also shows a reduction of about $5\\%$ in CPU usage efficiency compared to PSO, which is reflected in the efficiency of CPU resource usage also shows its efficiency. These features make the OIO algorithm show great potential in complex optimisation problems, and it is especially suitable for application scenarios that require fast, efficient and robust optimisation methods, such as robot path planning, supply chain management optimisation, and energy system management.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-10\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

It introduces the use of local self-attention within SSMs, which enhances their expressive power and ability to handle complex dependencies. This integration of self-attention into SSMs can be particularly beneficial for autoregressive tasks.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Adaptive Mechanisms in Linear Complexity Models\n\n- The concept of hierarchical state space models, as discussed in the analysis, shows promise. For instance, \"Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\" suggests stacking structured state-space models to create a temporal hierarchy, which can capture multi-scale dependencies efficiently while maintaining linear complexity.

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/86 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nThe other direction is wellestablished in the literature on semiseparable matrices. Proposition 3.4. Every N -semiseparable matrix has a N -SSS representation. Furthermore, note that although Definition 3.2 involves $O\\left(N^{2} \\mathrm{~T}\\right)$ parameters for the representation (in particular to store the A matrices), it can actually be compressed down to $O(\\mathrm{NT})$ parameters, which is asymptotically tight (Pernet, Signargout, and Villard 2023). Therefore in the rest of this paper we will conflate the structured matrix class (Definition 3.1) and a particular representation of it (Definition 3.2); we will always use this representation instead of other candidates. In turn we will use N -SS to refer to an N -semiseparable matrix in SSS form. Semiseparable matrices are a fundamental matrix structure and have many important properties. They are deeply related to recurrences at large, and can be defined by multiple characterizations (e.g. Definitions 3.1 and 3.2) which reveal different connections and efficient algorithms for them. We mention some of their other properties in Appendix C.1. Remark 2. The notion of semiseparability is very broad and many similar but subtlely different definitions appear in the literature; our definitions may differ slightly from other conventions. First, because we are primarily concerned with causal or autoregressive settings in this paper, we have restricted the definition of semiseparability to the triangular case; Definition 3.1 more formally might be called ( $\\mathrm{N}, 0$ )-semiseparability by some authors. Some authors may also instead refer to it as a form of quasiseparability (Eidelman and Gohberg 1999; Pernet 2016).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 73/86 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nIn: The International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR). 2024.

The scalar SSM scan is defined as computing the recurrent part of the discrete SSM (7), in the case when $N=1$ (i.e. $A$ is a scalar). This is commonly used to compute SSMs recurrently; in particular, the case of structured SSMs where $A$ is diagonally structured reduces down to this operation, such as in the S5 (J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023) and S6 (Gu and Dao 2023) models. The goal of this section is to support a central theme of this paper that efficient algorithms for sequence models can be viewed as structured matrix multiplication algorithms. The various matrix decomposition ideas we show here are related to ideas used to derive fast SSM algorithms (Section 6), as well as directly used as a subroutine. ## B. 1 Problem Definition\n\nLet $a:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) and $b:(\\mathrm{D}$, ) be sequences of scalars. The scalar SSM scan is defined as\n\n$$\nh_{t}=a_{t} h_{t-1}+b_{t}\n$$\n\nHere $h_{-1}$ can be an arbitrary value representing the previous hidden state to the SSM recurrence; unless otherwise specified, we assume $h_{-1}=0$. We also call equation (21) the cumprodsum (cumulative product sum). Note that the cumprodsum reduces to the cumprod (cumulative product) when $b=0$ is the additive identity and it reduces to the cumsum (cumulative sum) when $a=1$ is the multiplicative identity. Finally, note that in vectorized form we can write\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh & =M b \\\\\nM & =\\left[\\begin{array}{ccccc}\n1 & & & & \\\\\na_{1} & 1 & & & \\\\\na_{2} a_{1} & a_{2} & 1 & & \\\\\n\\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\ddots & \\\\\na_{T-1} \\ldots a_{1} & a_{T-1} \\ldots a_{2} & \\ldots & a_{T-1} & 1\n\\end{array}\\right]\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nIn other words, this is simply the matrix-vector product by a 1-SS matrix $M$. Therefore we have three ways of viewing this fundamental primitive operation that are all equivalent:\n\n- A (scalar) SSM scan. - A cumprodsum. - A 1-SS matrix-vector multiplication . ## B. 2 Classical Algorithms\n\nWe first describe the two classical ways of computing the SSM scan (21), previously used by prior work. ## B.2.1 Sequential Recurrence\n\nThe recurrent mode simply computes (21) one timestep $t$ at a time. From the perspective of 1-SS multiplication, this was also described in Section 3.4.1. ## B.2.2 Parallel Associative Scan\n\nSecond, an important observation is that this recurrence can be turned into an associative scan (E.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/86 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892 (2024).

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.61)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/35 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

In contrast to most known approaches for linearly structured rank minimization, we do not (a) use the full SVD, nor (b) resort to augmented Lagrangian techniques, nor (c) solve linear systems per iteration. Instead, we formulate the problem differently so that it is amenable to a generalized conditional gradient method, which results in a practical improvement with low per iteration computational cost.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix operations*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 3. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix operations*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Block-Coordinate Methods and Restarting for Solving Extensive-Form Games\n\n*From Search Query: block-wise processing optimization*\n\n*D. Chakrabarti, Jelena Diakonikolas, Christian Kroer*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents the first cyclic coordinate-descent-like method for the polytope of sequence-form strategies, which form the strategy spaces for the players in an extensive-form game (EFG), and introduces a restarting heuristic for EFG solving.\n\n**Abstract:** Coordinate descent methods are popular in machine learning and optimization for their simple sparse updates and excellent practical performance. In the context of large-scale sequential game solving, these same properties would be attractive, but until now no such methods were known, because the strategy spaces do not satisfy the typical separable block structure exploited by such methods. We present the first cyclic coordinate-descent-like method for the polytope of sequence-form strategies, which form the strategy spaces for the players in an extensive-form game (EFG). Our method exploits the recursive structure of the proximal update induced by what are known as dilated regularizers, in order to allow for a pseudo block-wise update. We show that our method enjoys a $O(1/T)$ convergence rate to a two-player zero-sum Nash equilibrium, while avoiding the worst-case polynomial scaling with the number of blocks common to cyclic methods. We empirically show that our algorithm usually performs better than other state-of-the-art first-order methods (i.e., mirror prox), and occasionally can even beat CFR$^+$, a state-of-the-art algorithm for numerical equilibrium computation in zero-sum EFGs. We then introduce a restarting heuristic for EFG solving. We show empirically that restarting can lead to speedups, sometimes huge, both for our cyclic method, as well as for existing methods such as mirror prox and predictive CFR$^+$.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Residual Learning in Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: block-wise processing optimization*\n\n*Wei Fang, Zhaofei Yu, Yanqing Chen, Tiejun Huang, T. Masquelier, Yonghong Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in deep SNNs and proves that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) present optimization difficulties for gradient-based approaches due to discrete binary activation and complex spatial-temporal dynamics. Considering the huge success of ResNet in deep learning, it would be natural to train deep SNNs with residual learning. Previous Spiking ResNet mimics the standard residual block in ANNs and simply replaces ReLU activation layers with spiking neurons, which suffers the degradation problem and can hardly implement residual learning. In this paper, we propose the spike-element-wise (SEW) ResNet to realize residual learning in deep SNNs. We prove that the SEW ResNet can easily implement identity mapping and overcome the vanishing/exploding gradient problems of Spiking ResNet. We evaluate our SEW ResNet on ImageNet, DVS Gesture, and CIFAR10-DVS datasets, and show that SEW ResNet outperforms the state-of-the-art directly trained SNNs in both accuracy and time-steps. Moreover, SEW ResNet can achieve higher performance by simply adding more layers, providing a simple method to train deep SNNs. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training deep SNNs with more than 100 layers becomes possible.

Learning World Models with Identifiable Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: block-wise processing optimization*\n\n*Yu-Ren Liu, Biwei Huang, Zhengmao Zhu, Hong Tian, Mingming Gong, Yang Yu, Kun Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** IFactor is proposed, a general framework to model four distinct categories of latent state variables that capture various aspects of information within the RL system, based on their interactions with actions and rewards, and establishes block-wise identifiability of these latent variables.\n\n**Abstract:** Extracting a stable and compact representation of the environment is crucial for efficient reinforcement learning in high-dimensional, noisy, and non-stationary environments. Different categories of information coexist in such environments -- how to effectively extract and disentangle these information remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we propose IFactor, a general framework to model four distinct categories of latent state variables that capture various aspects of information within the RL system, based on their interactions with actions and rewards. Our analysis establishes block-wise identifiability of these latent variables, which not only provides a stable and compact representation but also discloses that all reward-relevant factors are significant for policy learning. We further present a practical approach to learning the world model with identifiable blocks, ensuring the removal of redundants but retaining minimal and sufficient information for policy optimization. Experiments in synthetic worlds demonstrate that our method accurately identifies the ground-truth latent variables, substantiating our theoretical findings.

Beerel*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, dubbed as Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA), which incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a novel Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method, dubbed as Adaptive Freezing of Low Rank Adaptation (AFLoRA). Specifically, for each pre-trained frozen weight tensor, we add a parallel path of trainable low-rank matrices, namely a down-projection and an up-projection matrix, each of which is followed by a feature transformation vector. Based on a novel freezing score, we the incrementally freeze these projection matrices during fine-tuning to reduce the computation and alleviate over-fitting. Our experimental results demonstrate that we can achieve state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of up to $0.85\\%$ as evaluated on GLUE benchmark while yeilding up to $9.5\\times$ fewer average trainable parameters. While compared in terms of runtime, AFLoRA can yield up to $1.86\\times$ improvement as opposed to similar PEFT alternatives. Besides the practical utility of our approach, we provide insights on the trainability requirements of LoRA paths at different modules and the freezing schedule for the different projection matrices.

While such models offer a number of compelling benefits, it has been difficult for these to compete with modern classification algorithms in performance and even in feature extraction. \nIn this work, we propose a novel approach explicitly designed to address a number of subtle yet important issues which have stymied earlier DML algorithms. It maintains an explicit model of the distributions of the different classes in representation space. It then employs this knowledge to adaptively assess similarity, and achieve local discrimination by penalizing class distribution overlap. \nWe demonstrate the effectiveness of this idea on several tasks. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification results on a number of fine-grained visual recognition datasets, surpassing the standard softmax classifier and outperforming triplet loss by a relative margin of 30-40%. In terms of computational performance, it alleviates training inefficiencies in the traditional triplet loss, reaching the same error in 5-30 times fewer iterations. Beyond classification, we further validate the saliency of the learnt representations via their attribute concentration and hierarchy recovery properties, achieving 10-25% relative gains on the softmax classifier and 25-50% on triplet loss in these tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 210  (*Influential: 27*)\n\n#### 9. Near Input Sparsity Time Kernel Embeddings via Adaptive Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature transformation*\n\n*David P. Woodruff, A. Zandieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A near input sparsity time algorithm for sampling the high-dimensional feature space implicitly defined by a kernel transformation, and shows how its subspace embedding bounds imply new statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression.\n\n**Abstract:** To accelerate kernel methods, we propose a near input sparsity time algorithm for sampling the high-dimensional feature space implicitly defined by a kernel transformation. Our main contribution is an importance sampling method for subsampling the feature space of a degree $q$ tensoring of data points in almost input sparsity time, improving the recent oblivious sketching method of (Ahle et al., 2020) by a factor of $q^{5/2}/\\epsilon^2$. This leads to a subspace embedding for the polynomial kernel, as well as the Gaussian kernel, with a target dimension that is only linearly dependent on the statistical dimension of the kernel and in time which is only linearly dependent on the sparsity of the input dataset. We show how our subspace embedding bounds imply new statistical guarantees for kernel ridge regression. Furthermore, we empirically show that in large-scale regression tasks, our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art kernel approximation methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. A Simple Convolutional Generative Network for Next Item Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix operations*\n\n*Joemon M. Jose, Fajie Yuan, Ioannis Arapakis, Xiangnan He, Alexandros Karatzoglou*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been recently introduced in the\ndomain of session-based next item recommendation. An ordered collection of past\nitems the user has interacted with in a session (or sequence) are embedded into\na 2-dimensional latent matrix, and treated as an image. The convolution and\npooling operations are then applied to the mapped item embeddings. In this\npaper, we first examine the typical session-based CNN recommender and show that\nboth the generative model and network architecture are suboptimal when modeling\nlong-range dependencies in the item sequence. To address the issues, we\nintroduce a simple, but very effective generative model that is capable of\nlearning high-level representation from both short- and long-range item\ndependencies. The network architecture of the proposed model is formed of a\nstack of \\emph{holed} convolutional layers, which can efficiently increase the\nreceptive fields without relying on the pooling operation. Another contribution\nis the effective use of residual block structure in recommender systems, which\ncan ease the optimization for much deeper networks. The proposed generative\nmodel attains state-of-the-art accuracy with less training time in the next\nitem recommendation task. It accordingly can be used as a powerful\nrecommendation baseline to beat in future, especially when there are long\nsequences of user feedback.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-15\n\n\n\n#### 2. CoLA: Exploiting Compositional Structure for Automatic and Efficient Numerical Linear Algebra\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix operations*\n\n*Andrew Gordon Wilson, Geoff Pleiss, Marc Finzi, Andres Potapczynski*\n\n**Abstract:** Many areas of machine learning and science involve large linear algebra problems, such as eigendecompositions, solving linear systems, computing matrix exponentials, and trace estimation. The matrices involved often have Kronecker, convolutional, block diagonal, sum, or product structure. In this paper, we propose a simple but general framework for large-scale linear algebra problems in machine learning, named CoLA (Compositional Linear Algebra). By combining a linear operator abstraction with compositional dispatch rules, CoLA automatically constructs memory and runtime efficient numerical algorithms. Moreover, CoLA provides memory efficient automatic differentiation, low precision computation, and GPU acceleration in both JAX and PyTorch, while also accommodating new objects, operations, and rules in downstream packages via multiple dispatch. CoLA can accelerate many algebraic operations, while making it easy to prototype matrix structures and algorithms, providing an appealing drop-in tool for virtually any computational effort that requires linear algebra. We showcase its efficacy across a broad range of applications, including partial differential equations, Gaussian processes, equivariant model construction, and unsupervised learning.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. 8-bit Optimizers via Block-wise Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: block-wise processing optimization*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Sam Shleifer, Mike Lewis, Tim Dettmers*\n\n**Abstract:** Stateful optimizers maintain gradient statistics over time, e.g., the exponentially smoothed sum (SGD with momentum) or squared sum (Adam) of past gradient values. This state can be used to accelerate optimization compared to plain stochastic gradient descent but uses memory that might otherwise be allocated to model parameters, thereby limiting the maximum size of models trained in practice. In this paper, we develop the first optimizers that use 8-bit statistics while maintaining the performance levels of using 32-bit optimizer states. To overcome the resulting computational, quantization, and stability challenges, we develop block-wise dynamic quantization. Block-wise quantization divides input tensors into smaller blocks that are independently quantized. Each block is processed in parallel across cores, yielding faster optimization and high precision quantization. To maintain stability and performance, we combine block-wise quantization with two additional changes: (1) dynamic quantization, a form of non-linear optimization that is precise for both large and small magnitude values, and (2) a stable embedding layer to reduce gradient variance that comes from the highly non-uniform distribution of input tokens in language models. As a result, our 8-bit optimizers maintain 32-bit performance with a small fraction of the memory footprint on a range of tasks, including 1.5B parameter language modeling, GLUE finetuning, ImageNet classification, WMT'14 machine translation, MoCo v2 contrastive ImageNet pretraining+finetuning, and RoBERTa pretraining, without changes to the original optimizer hyperparameters. We open-source our 8-bit optimizers as a drop-in replacement that only requires a two-line code change.\n\n**Conference:** 8-bit-optimizers-via-block-wise-quantization-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-06\n\n\n\n#### 4. GhostNets on Heterogeneous Devices via Cheap Operations\n\n*From Search Query: block-wise processing optimization*\n\n*Qi Tian, Enhua Wu, Chunjing Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Chang Xu, Yunhe Wang, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on mobile devices is difficult due to the limited memory and computation resources. We aim to design efficient neural networks for heterogeneous devices including CPU and GPU, by exploiting the redundancy in feature maps, which has rarely been investigated in neural architecture design. For CPU-like devices, we propose a novel CPU-efficient Ghost (C-Ghost) module to generate more feature maps from cheap operations. Based on a set of intrinsic feature maps, we apply a series of linear transformations with cheap cost to generate many ghost feature maps that could fully reveal information underlying intrinsic features. The proposed C-Ghost module can be taken as a plug-and-play component to upgrade existing convolutional neural networks. C-Ghost bottlenecks are designed to stack C-Ghost modules, and then the lightweight C-GhostNet can be easily established. We further consider the efficient networks for GPU devices. Without involving too many GPU-inefficient operations (e.g.,, depth-wise convolution) in a building stage, we propose to utilize the stage-wise feature redundancy to formulate GPU-efficient Ghost (G-Ghost) stage structure. The features in a stage are split into two parts where the first part is processed using the original block with fewer output channels for generating intrinsic features, and the other are generated using cheap operations by exploiting stage-wise redundancy. Experiments conducted on benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed C-Ghost module and the G-Ghost stage. C-GhostNet and G-GhostNet can achieve the optimal trade-off of accuracy and latency for CPU and GPU, respectively.

Exploring Sequence Feature Alignment for Domain Adaptive Detection Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature transformation*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Yonggang Wen, Zheng-Jun Zha, Fengxiang He, Jing Zhang, Yang Cao, Wen Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Detection transformers have recently shown promising object detection results and attracted increasing attention. However, how to develop effective domain adaptation techniques to improve its cross-domain performance remains unexplored and unclear. In this paper, we delve into this topic and empirically find that direct feature distribution alignment on the CNN backbone only brings limited improvements, as it does not guarantee domain-invariant sequence features in the transformer for prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel Sequence Feature Alignment (SFA) method that is specially designed for the adaptation of detection transformers. Technically, SFA consists of a domain query-based feature alignment (DQFA) module and a token-wise feature alignment (TDA) module. In DQFA, a novel domain query is used to aggregate and align global context from the token sequence of both domains. DQFA reduces the domain discrepancy in global feature representations and object relations when deploying in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Meanwhile, TDA aligns token features in the sequence from both domains, which reduces the domain gaps in local and instance-level feature representations in the transformer encoder and decoder, respectively. Besides, a novel bipartite matching consistency loss is proposed to enhance the feature discriminability for robust object detection. Experiments on three challenging benchmarks show that SFA outperforms state-of-the-art domain adaptive object detection methods.

Variable-Rate Deep Image Compression through Spatially-Adaptive Feature Transform\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive feature transformation*\n\n*Bohyung Han, Jinyoung Choi, Myungseo Song*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a versatile deep image compression network based on Spatial Feature Transform (SFT arXiv:1804.02815), which takes a source image and a corresponding quality map as inputs and produce a compressed image with variable rates. Our model covers a wide range of compression rates using a single model, which is controlled by arbitrary pixel-wise quality maps. In addition, the proposed framework allows us to perform task-aware image compressions for various tasks, e.g., classification, by efficiently estimating optimized quality maps specific to target tasks for our encoding network. This is even possible with a pretrained network without learning separate models for individual tasks. Our algorithm achieves outstanding rate-distortion trade-off compared to the approaches based on multiple models that are optimized separately for several different target rates. At the same level of compression, the proposed approach successfully improves performance on image classification and text region quality preservation via task-aware quality map estimation without additional model training.

These SALs employ a lightweight gating network to dynamically determine which tokens should undergo softmax attention processing, thereby balancing computational efficiency with enhanced long-range modeling capabilities. This selective approach allows for adaptive feature transformation while maintaining linear memory usage.\n\n### State Space Duality (SSD) Framework\nThe SSD framework, as discussed in the references, provides a theoretical foundation for designing efficient models.

Proposition 3.4. Every N -semiseparable matrix has a N -SSS representation. Furthermore, note that although Definition 3.2 involves $O\\left(N^{2} \\mathrm{~T}\\right)$ parameters for the representation (in particular to store the A matrices), it can actually be compressed down to $O(\\mathrm{NT})$ parameters, which is asymptotically tight (Pernet, Signargout, and Villard 2023). Therefore in the rest of this paper we will conflate the structured matrix class (Definition 3.1) and a particular representation of it (Definition 3.2); we will always use this representation instead of other candidates. In turn we will use N -SS to refer to an N -semiseparable matrix in SSS form. Semiseparable matrices are a fundamental matrix structure and have many important properties. They are deeply related to recurrences at large, and can be defined by multiple characterizations (e.g. Definitions 3.1 and 3.2) which reveal different connections and efficient algorithms for them. We mention some of their other properties in Appendix C.1. Remark 2. The notion of semiseparability is very broad and many similar but subtlely different definitions appear in the literature; our definitions may differ slightly from other conventions. First, because we are primarily concerned with causal or autoregressive settings in this paper, we have restricted the definition of semiseparability to the triangular case; Definition 3.1 more formally might be called ( $\\mathrm{N}, 0$ )-semiseparability by some authors. Some authors may also instead refer to it as a form of quasiseparability (Eidelman and Gohberg 1999; Pernet 2016).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 58/86 (Score: 0.17)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892 (2024).

Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 2. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices, and proposes a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which is shown to be better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

However, not all tokens are equally important, especially for longer documents. We propose CoLT5, a long-input Transformer model that builds on this intuition by employing conditional computation, devoting more resources to important tokens in both feedforward and attention layers. We show that CoLT5 achieves stronger performance than LongT5 with much faster training and inference, achieving SOTA on the long-input SCROLLS benchmark. Moreover, CoLT5 can effectively and tractably make use of extremely long inputs, showing strong gains up to 64k input length.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 52  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. CrypTen: Secure Multi-Party Computation Meets Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: semiseparable computation*\n\n*Brian Knott, Shobha Venkataraman, Awni Y. Hannun, Shubho Sengupta, Mark Ibrahim, L. Maaten*\n\n**TL;DR:** CrypTen is a software framework that exposes popular secure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern machine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic differentiation, and modular neural networks, and it is hoped that CrypTen will spur adoption of secureMPC in the machine- learning community.\n\n**Abstract:** Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations on data while keeping that data private. This capability has great potential for machine-learning applications: it facilitates training of machine-learning models on private data sets owned by different parties, evaluation of one party's private model using another party's private data, etc. Although a range of studies implement machine-learning models via secure MPC, such implementations are not yet mainstream. Adoption of secure MPC is hampered by the absence of flexible software frameworks that\"speak the language\"of machine-learning researchers and engineers. To foster adoption of secure MPC in machine learning, we present CrypTen: a software framework that exposes popular secure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern machine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic differentiation, and modular neural networks. This paper describes the design of CrypTen and measure its performance on state-of-the-art models for text classification, speech recognition, and image classification. Our benchmarks show that CrypTen's GPU support and high-performance communication between (an arbitrary number of) parties allows it to perform efficient private evaluation of modern machine-learning models under a semi-honest threat model. For example, two parties using CrypTen can securely predict phonemes in speech recordings using Wav2Letter faster than real-time. We hope that CrypTen will spur adoption of secure MPC in the machine-learning community.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 289  (*Influential: 60*)\n\n#### 8. How to Capture Higher-order Correlations? Generalizing Matrix Softmax Attention to Kronecker Computation\n\n*From Search Query: semiseparable computation*\n\n*Josh Alman, Zhao Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise correlations, and shows that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations and yields a natural tradeoff between the boundedness of the entries, and order of the tensor one may use for more expressive, efficient attention computation.\n\n**Abstract:** In the classical transformer attention scheme, we are given three $n \\times d$ size matrices $Q, K, V$ (the query, key, and value tokens), and the goal is to compute a new $n \\times d$ size matrix $D^{-1} \\exp(QK^\\top) V$ where $D = \\mathrm{diag}( \\exp(QK^\\top) {\\bf 1}_n )$. In this work, we study a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise correlations. This generalization is able to solve problems about detecting triple-wise connections that were shown to be impossible for transformers. The potential downside of this generalization is that it appears as though computations are even more difficult, since the straightforward algorithm requires cubic time in $n$. However, we show that in the bounded-entry setting (which arises in practice, and which is well-studied in both theory and practice), there is actually a near-linear time algorithm. More precisely, we show that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations: $\\bullet$ On the positive side, if all entries of the input matrices are bounded above by $o(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$ then we show how to approximate the ``tensor-type'' attention matrix in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. $\\bullet$ On the negative side, we show that if the entries of the input matrices may be as large as $\\Omega(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$, then there is no algorithm that runs faster than $n^{3-o(1)}$ (assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory). We also show that our construction, algorithms, and lower bounds naturally generalize to higher-order tensors and correlations. Interestingly, the higher the order of the tensors, the lower the bound on the entries needs to be for an efficient algorithm. Our results thus yield a natural tradeoff between the boundedness of the entries, and order of the tensor one may use for more expressive, efficient attention computation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. DeFT: Decoding with Flash Tree-attention for Efficient Tree-structured\n  LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Jinwei Yao, Kaiqi Chen, Kexun Zhang, Jiaxuan You, Binhang Yuan, Zeke Wang, Tao Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed for complex tasks that\nprocess multiple generation calls in a tree structure with shared prefixes of\ntokens, including few-shot prompting, multi-step reasoning, speculative\ndecoding, etc. However, existing inference systems for tree-based applications\nare inefficient due to improper partitioning of queries and KV cache during\nattention calculation. This leads to two main issues: (1) a lack of memory\naccess (IO) reuse for KV cache of shared prefixes, and (2) poor load\nbalancing.As a result, there is redundant KV cache IO between GPU global memory\nand shared memory, along with low GPU utilization. To address these challenges,\nwe propose DeFT(Decoding with Flash Tree-Attention), a hardware-efficient\nattention algorithm with prefix-aware and load-balanced KV cache partitions.\nDeFT reduces the number of read/write operations of KV cache during attention\ncalculation through KV-Guided Grouping, a method that avoids repeatedly loading\nKV cache of shared prefixes in attention computation. Additionally, we propose\nFlattened Tree KV Splitting, a mechanism that ensures even distribution of the\nKV cache across partitions with little computation redundancy, enhancing GPU\nutilization during attention computations. By reducing 73-99 KV cache IO and\nnearly 100 IO for partial results during attention calculation, DeFT achieves\nup to 2.52/3.82x speedup in the end-to-end/attention latency across three\npractical tree-based workloads compared to state-of-the-art attention\nalgorithms.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-30T04:34:54Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T22:17:01Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. BLAST: Block-Level Adaptive Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Network Inference\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Hun-Seok Kim, Qing Qu, Soo Min Kwon, Changwoo Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in language and vision tasks. However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operations involved in these large networks pose significant computational challenges during inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-Level Adaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficient structures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deep learning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrix offers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structures that are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix for compressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sized models such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performance while reducing complexity by 70% and 40%, respectively; and (ii) for large foundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2x compression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among all tested structured matrices.

Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Yandong Wen, Songyou Peng, Juyeon Heo, Zhen Liu, Haiwen Feng, Longhui Yu, Yuxuan Xue, Yuliang Xiu, Yao Feng, Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large foundation models are becoming ubiquitous, but training them from scratch is prohibitively expensive. Thus, efficiently adapting these powerful models to downstream tasks is increasingly important. In this paper, we study a principled finetuning paradigm -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) -- for downstream task adaptation. Despite demonstrating good generalizability, OFT still uses a fairly large number of trainable parameters due to the high dimensionality of orthogonal matrices. To address this, we start by examining OFT from an information transmission perspective, and then identify a few key desiderata that enable better parameter-efficiency. Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, we propose an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures. We apply this parameterization to OFT, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT). By subsuming OFT as a special case, BOFT introduces a generalized orthogonal finetuning framework. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical study of adapting large vision transformers, large language models, and text-to-image diffusion models to various downstream tasks in vision and language.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Computing Functions of Symmetric Hierarchically Semiseparable Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: semiseparable computation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The aim of this work is to develop a fast algorithm for approximating the matrix function $f(A)$ of a square matrix $A$ that is symmetric and has hierarchically semiseparable (HSS) structure. Appearing in a wide variety of applications, often in the context of discretized (fractional) differential and integral operators, HSS matrices have a number of attractive properties facilitating the development of fast algorithms. In this work, we use an unconventional telescopic decomposition of $A$, inspired by recent work of Levitt and Martinsson on approximating an HSS matrix from matrix-vector products with a few random vectors. This telescopic decomposition allows us to approximate $f(A)$ by recursively performing low-rank updates with rational Krylov subspaces while keeping the size of the matrices involved in the rational Krylov subspaces small. In particular, no large-scale linear system needs to be solved, which yields favorable complexity estimates and reduced execution times compared to existing methods, including an existing divide-and-conquer strategy. The advantages of our newly proposed algorithms are demonstrated for a number of examples from the literature, featuring the exponential, the inverse square root, and the sign function of a matrix. Even for matrix inversion, our algorithm exhibits superior performance, even if not specifically designed for this task.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 6.

We develop a new divide-and-conquer method based on (rational) Krylov subspace methods for performing low-rank updates of matrix functions. Our convergence analysis of the newly proposed method proceeds by establishing relations to best polynomial and rational approximation. When only the trace or the diagonal of the matrix function is of interest, we demonstrate -- in practice and in theory -- that convergence can be faster. For the special case of a banded matrix, we show that the divide-and-conquer method reduces to a much simpler algorithm, which proceeds by computing matrix functions of small submatrices. Numerical experiments confirm the effectiveness of the newly developed algorithms for computing large-scale matrix functions from a wide variety of applications.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using adaptive structured matrices, hardware-efficient attention, and semiseparable computation, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Adaptive Mechanisms in Structured Matrix Computations\n\nThe concept of adaptive structured matrices is well-explored in the context of efficient deep neural network inference.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/29 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.05254, 2024b.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 4. When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

Similar concepts have been extensively explored in existing literature:\n\n     - **Routing Transformers** already implement content-based routing mechanisms to dynamically select tokens for attention, aiming to improve efficiency and scalability (Roy et al., 2021).\n     - **SBM-Transformer** enhances this concept by using stochastic block models to data-adaptively sample attention patterns (Cho et al., 2022).\n     - **Sparse Transformers** and **Reformer** utilize sparse attention patterns and efficient computation methods to handle long sequences.\n\n     Recent works like **Lou et al., 2024** introduce innovative sparse attention mechanisms with differentiable top-k masking, and **Ren et al., 2023** propose Sparse Modular Activation, which achieves model sparsity through dynamic activation of sub-modules.\n\n     Therefore, RSLA overlaps significantly with existing models in both concept and implementation, lacking sufficient novelty.\n\n   - **Implementation Feasibility:**\n\n     Implementing differentiable routing introduces computational overhead and complexity in training. The proposal mentions the need for an efficient backward pass and stable training process, but lacks detailed strategies to address these challenges.\n\n     Existing models have already tackled similar issues, and without specific innovations, RSLA may not provide practical advantages over established methods.\n\n   - **Impact on Model Performance:**\n\n     - **Accuracy and Expressiveness:** While RSLA aims to enhance expressiveness by focusing on important dependencies, it's unclear if it offers significant improvements over existing models like SBM-Transformer or SMA (Ren et al., 2023).\n     - **Efficiency and Scalability:** The added complexity from routing mechanisms may negate efficiency gains from sparsity and block-wise computation. Existing models have optimized these aspects, and RSLA needs to demonstrate clear advantages.\n     - **Robustness:** Dynamic routing could improve robustness by adapting to varying input patterns, but this benefit has been explored in prior work.\n\n   - **Hardware-Aware Design:**\n\n     While the proposal mentions hardware-aware optimization, practical implementation details are lacking, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness.\n\n   - **Alternative Approaches and Potential Improvements:**\n\n     To enhance novelty and impact, the proposal could explore:\n\n     - **Integrating State Space Models (SSMs):** Explore combining SSMs with attention mechanisms to handle long sequences more effectively, as in **Smith et al., 2022** and **Fu et al., 2023**.\n     - **Unique Sparse Patterns:** Investigate novel sparsity patterns inspired by expander graphs or other mathematical constructs, as in **Shirzad et al., 2023**.\n     - **Implicit Attention Mechanisms:** Consider models that reframe attention as implicit processes, as in **Zimerman et al., 2024**, which might offer new perspectives.\n     - **Hybrid Models:** Explore combining attention mechanisms with other architectures, such as convolutional or recurrent networks, to capture both local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n4. **Future Search Plan or Next Steps:**\n\n   - **Investigate State Space Models in Transformers:**\n\n     - Examine recent works like **Gu and Dao, 2024** - \"Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\" to understand how SSMs can be leveraged for efficient sequence modeling.\n\n   - **Explore Innovative Sparse Attention Mechanisms:**\n\n     - Look into the latest research on adaptive sparsity and efficient attention mechanisms not covered in the current analysis.\n\n   - **Consider Alternative Mechanisms:**\n\n     - Investigate cross-disciplinary methods from areas like graph neural networks or implicit attention formulations that might inspire unique approaches.\n\n   - **Assess Theoretical Foundations:**\n\n     - Search for theoretical frameworks proposing new foundations for attention mechanisms and sequence modeling.\n\n   - **Review Hardware-Specific Implementations:**\n\n     - Explore recent advancements in optimizing transformers for specific hardware architectures to uncover innovative efficiency strategies.\n\n5. **List of References:**\n\n   - Cho, S., Min, S., Kim, J., Lee, M., Lee, H., & Hong, S.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Aurko Roy, M. Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192. We open-source the code for Routing Transformer in Tensorflow.1\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/50 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers \n\nAurko Roy and Mohammad Saffar and Ashish Vaswani and David Grangier<br>Google Research<br>\\{aurkor, msaffar, avaswani, grangier\\}@google.com\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSelf-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems.\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/16 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2021.

Sparse MoE as the New Dropout: Scaling Dense and Self-Slimmable Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: routing transformers*\n\n*Tianlong Chen, Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ajay Jaiswal, Shiwei Liu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse and explores the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievement, gigantic transformers encounter significant drawbacks, including exorbitant computational and memory footprints during training, as well as severe collapse evidenced by a high degree of parameter redundancy. Sparsely-activated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoEs) have shown promise to mitigate the issue of training efficiency, yet they are prone to (1) redundant experts due to representational collapse; and (2) poor expert scalability for inference and downstream fine-tuning, primarily due to overfitting of the learned routing policy to the number of activated experts during training. As recent research efforts are predominantly focused on improving routing policies to encourage expert specializations, this work focuses on exploring the overlooked scalability bottleneck of SMoEs and leveraging it to effectively scale dense transformers. To this end, we propose a new plug-and-play training framework, SMoE-Dropout, to enable scaling transformers to better accuracy in their full capacity without collapse. Specifically, SMoE-Dropout consists of a randomly initialized and fixed router network to activate experts and gradually increases the activated expert number as training progresses over time. Transformers trained by SMoE-Dropout naturally exhibit a self-slimmable property subject to resource availability, offering smooth and consistent performance boosts with an increase in activated experts during inference or fine-tuning. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance and substantial computation savings of SMoE-Dropout, compared to dense training baselines with equivalent parameter counts. In particular, our trained BERT outperforms its densely trained counterpart with consistent improvements of {1.03%, 0.78%, 1.09%} on challenging reasoning tasks {ASDiv-A, MAWPS, SVAMP}, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Learning to Hash\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Zhiqing Sun, Yiming Yang, Shinjae Yoo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively is proposed, which is applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer has become ubiquitous in sequence modeling tasks. As a key component of Transformer, self-attention does not scale to long sequences due to its quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. To tackle this problem, recent work developed dynamic attention sparsification techniques based on Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) methods, where similar queries and keys are allocated to the same hash bucket with high probability. However, the effectiveness of those ANN methods relies on the assumption that queries and keys should lie in the same space, which is not well justified. Besides, some of the ANN methods such as Locality-Sensitive Hashing (LSH) are randomized and cannot fully utilize the available real data distributions. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a new strategy for sparse attention, namely LHA (Learningto-Hash Attention), which directly learns separate parameterized hash functions for queries and keys, respectively. Another advantage of LHA is that it does not impose extra constraints for queries and keys, which makes it applicable to the wide range of pre-trained Transformer models. Our experiments on evaluation of the WikiText-103 dataset for language modeling, the GLUE benchmark for natural language understanding, and the Lang-Range-Arena benchmark for multiple tasks (text/image classification, retrieval, etc.) show the superior performance of LHA over other strong Transformer variants.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Long-range Sequence Modeling with Predictable Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Yimeng Zhuang, Jing Zhang, Mei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling, which remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanism has been shown to be an effective approach for capturing global context dependencies in sequence modeling, but it suffers from quadratic complexity in time and memory usage. Due to the sparsity of the attention matrix, much computation is redundant. Therefore, in this paper, we design an efficient Transformer architecture, named Fourier Sparse Attention for Transformer (FSAT), for fast long-range sequence modeling. We provide a brand-new perspective for constructing sparse attention matrix, i.e. making the sparse attention matrix predictable. Two core sub-modules are: (1) A fast Fourier transform based hidden state cross module, which captures and pools L^2 semantic combinations in \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L) time complexity. (2) A sparse attention matrix estimation module, which predicts dominant elements of an attention matrix based on the output of the previous hidden state cross module. By reparameterization and gradient truncation, FSAT successfully learned the index of dominant elements. The overall complexity about the sequence length is reduced from \\mathcal{O}(L^2) to \\mathcal{O}(L\\log L). Extensive experiments (natural language, vision, and math) show that FSAT remarkably outperforms the standard multi-head attention and its variants in various long-sequence tasks with low computational costs, and achieves new state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Is Sparse Attention more Interpretable?\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Clara Meister, Stefan Lazov, Isabelle Augenstein, Ryan Cotterell*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is observed in this setting that inducing sparsity may make it less plausible that attention can be used as a tool for understanding model behavior.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention has been claimed to increase model interpretability under the assumption that it highlights influential inputs. Yet the attention distribution is typically over representations internal to the model rather than the inputs themselves, suggesting this assumption may not have merit. We build on the recent work exploring the interpretability of attention; we design a set of experiments to help us understand how sparsity affects our ability to use attention as an explainability tool. On three text classification tasks, we verify that only a weak relationship between inputs and co-indexed intermediate representations exists\u2014under sparse attention and otherwise. Further, we do not find any plausible mappings from sparse attention distributions to a sparse set of influential inputs through other avenues. Rather, we observe in this setting that inducing sparsity may make it less plausible that attention can be used as a tool for understanding model behavior.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. STAR-Caps: Capsule Networks with Straight-Through Attentive Routing\n\n*From Search Query: differentiable routing attention*\n\n*Karim Ahmed, L. Torresani*\n\n**TL;DR:** Star-Caps is proposed, a capsule-based network that exploits a straight-through attentive routing to address the drawbacks of capsule networks and outperforms the baseline capsule networks on several image classification datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Capsule networks have been shown to be powerful models for image classification, thanks to their ability to represent and capture viewpoint variations of an object. However, the high computational complexity of capsule networks that stems from the recurrent dynamic routing poses a major drawback making their use for large-scale image classification challenging. In this work, we propose Star-Caps a capsule-based network that exploits a straight-through attentive routing to address the drawbacks of capsule networks. By utilizing attention modules augmented by differentiable binary routers, the proposed mechanism estimates the routing coefficients between capsules without recurrence, as opposed to prior related work. Subsequently, the routers utilize straight-through estimators to make binary decisions to either connect or disconnect the route between capsules, allowing stable and faster performance. The experiments conducted on several image classification datasets, including MNIST, SmallNorb, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet show that Star-Caps outperforms the baseline capsule networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 50  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8.

The new mechanism 1) designs routing via inverted dot-product attention; 2) imposes Layer Normalization as normalization; and 3) replaces sequential iterative routing with concurrent iterative routing. When compared to previously proposed routing algorithms, our method improves performance on benchmark datasets such as CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, and it performs at-par with a powerful CNN (ResNet-18) with 4x fewer parameters. On a different task of recognizing digits from overlayed digit images, the proposed capsule model performs favorably against CNNs given the same number of layers and neurons per layer. We believe that our work raises the possibility of applying capsule networks to complex real-world tasks.

However, to push this idea towards practical implementation, we need better models and better ways of training. We contribute in both directions: we propose a model based on attention layers with benefits over the Pointer Network and we show how to train this model using REINFORCE with a simple baseline based on a deterministic greedy rollout, which we find is more efficient than using a value function. We significantly improve over recent learned heuristics for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), getting close to optimal results for problems up to 100 nodes. With the same hyperparameters, we learn strong heuristics for two variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), the Orienteering Problem (OP) and (a stochastic variant of) the Prize Collecting TSP (PCTSP), outperforming a wide range of baselines and getting results close to highly optimized and specialized algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 999  (*Influential: 264*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on\ntasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential\nelements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long\nseqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention\noperation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying\nor linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot\nstraightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often\nrequire complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and\nlinear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention\nmatrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention\nwith an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with\nlinear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates\na sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention\noperation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse\nattention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the\nquadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than\nOPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable\nattention matrix.

BiFormer: Vision Transformer with Bi-Level Routing Attention\n\n*From Search Query: routing transformers*\n\n*Rynson Lau, Wayne Zhang, Zhanghan Ke, Xinjiang Wang, Lei Zhu*\n\n**Abstract:** As the core building block of vision transformers, attention is a powerful tool to capture long-range dependency. However, such power comes at a cost: it incurs a huge computation burden and heavy memory footprint as pairwise token interaction across all spatial locations is computed. A series of works attempt to alleviate this problem by introducing handcrafted and content-agnostic sparsity into attention, such as restricting the attention operation to be inside local windows, axial stripes, or dilated windows. In contrast to these approaches, we propose a novel dynamic sparse attention via bi-level routing to enable a more flexible allocation of computations with content awareness. Specifically, for a query, irrelevant key-value pairs are first filtered out at a coarse region level, and then fine-grained token-to-token attention is applied in the union of remaining candidate regions (\\ie, routed regions). We provide a simple yet effective implementation of the proposed bi-level routing attention, which utilizes the sparsity to save both computation and memory while involving only GPU-friendly dense matrix multiplications. Built with the proposed bi-level routing attention, a new general vision transformer, named BiFormer, is then presented. As BiFormer attends to a small subset of relevant tokens in a \\textbf{query adaptive} manner without distraction from other irrelevant ones, it enjoys both good performance and high computational efficiency, especially in dense prediction tasks. Empirical results across several computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation verify the effectiveness of our design.

Efficient Content-Based Sparse Attention with Routing Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: routing transformers*\n\n*Mohammad Saffar, David Grangier, Ashish Vaswani, Aurko Roy*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic compute and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: it combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to $O\\left(n^{1.5}d\\right)$ from $O\\left(n^2d\\right)$ for sequence length $n$ and hidden dimension $d$. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity) as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Bo Dai, Dale Schuurmans, Jure Leskovec, Mengjiao Yang, Zihang Dai, Hanjun Dai, Hongyu Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. MInference 1.0: Accelerating Pre-filling for Long-Context LLMs via Dynamic Sparse Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Chin-Yew Lin, Dongsheng Li, Amir H. Abdi, Zhenhua Han, Surin Ahn, Xufang Luo, Qianhui Wu, Chengruidong Zhang, Yucheng Li, Huiqiang Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational challenges of Large Language Model (LLM) inference remain a significant barrier to their widespread deployment, especially as prompt lengths continue to increase. Due to the quadratic complexity of the attention computation, it takes 30 minutes for an 8B LLM to process a prompt of 1M tokens (i.e., the pre-filling stage) on a single A100 GPU. Existing methods for speeding up prefilling often fail to maintain acceptable accuracy or efficiency when applied to long-context LLMs. To address this gap, we introduce MInference (Milliontokens Inference), a sparse calculation method designed to accelerate pre-filling of long-sequence processing. Specifically, we identify three unique patterns in long-context attention matrices-the A-shape, Vertical-Slash, and Block-Sparsethat can be leveraged for efficient sparse computation on GPUs. We determine the optimal pattern for each attention head offline and dynamically build sparse indices based on the assigned pattern during inference. With the pattern and sparse indices, we perform efficient sparse attention calculations via our optimized GPU kernels to significantly reduce the latency in the pre-filling stage of long-context LLMs. Our proposed technique can be directly applied to existing LLMs without any modifications to the pre-training setup or additional fine-tuning. By evaluating on a wide range of downstream tasks, including InfiniteBench, RULER, PG-19, and Needle In A Haystack, and models including LLaMA-3-1M, GLM4-1M, Yi-200K, Phi-3-128K, and Qwen2-128K, we demonstrate that MInference effectively reduces inference latency by up to 10x for pre-filling on an A100, while maintaining accuracy.

DRL4Route: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: differentiable routing attention*\n\n*Youfang Lin, Haoyuan Hu, Jianbin Zheng, Lixia Wu, Huaiyu Wan, Hengrui Zhang, Haomin Wen, Xiaowei Mao*\n\n**Abstract:** Pick-up and Delivery Route Prediction (PDRP), which aims to estimate the future service route of a worker given his current task pool, has received rising attention in recent years. Deep neural networks based on supervised learning have emerged as the dominant model for the task because of their powerful ability to capture workers' behavior patterns from massive historical data. Though promising, they fail to introduce the non-differentiable test criteria into the training process, leading to a mismatch in training and test criteria. Which considerably trims down their performance when applied in practical systems. To tackle the above issue, we present the first attempt to generalize Reinforcement Learning (RL) to the route prediction task, leading to a novel RL-based framework called DRL4Route. It combines the behavior-learning abilities of previous deep learning models with the non-differentiable objective optimization ability of reinforcement learning. DRL4Route can serve as a plug-and-play component to boost the existing deep learning models. Based on the framework, we further implement a model named DRL4Route-GAE for PDRP in logistic service. It follows the actor-critic architecture which is equipped with a Generalized Advantage Estimator that can balance the bias and variance of the policy gradient estimates, thus achieving a more optimal policy. Extensive offline experiments and the online deployment show that DRL4Route-GAE improves Location Square Deviation (LSD) by 0.9%-2.7%, and Accuracy@3 (ACC@3) by 2.4%-3.2% over existing methods on the real-world dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, such as the proposed **RoutedSparseLinearAttention (RSLA)**, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the analysis and search results:\n\n## Novelty and Originality\n- The concept of combining differentiable routing with sparse attention mechanisms is not entirely new. **Routing Transformers** by Roy et al. (2021) already implement a similar approach, using a differentiable routing mechanism to dynamically select tokens to attend to.\n- **Sparse Transformers** and **Reformer** also employ sparse attention patterns and efficient computation methods, which suggests that while RSLA may refine these ideas, it may not be entirely novel.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Models\n- **Routing Transformers**: These models use a content-based routing mechanism to improve efficiency and scalability.

As an important modeling tool, neural attention should capture long-range interaction in such sequences. However, most existing neural attention models admit only short sequences, or they have to employ chunking or padding to enforce a constant input length. Here we propose a simple neural network building block called ChordMixer which can model the attention for long sequences with variable lengths. Each ChordMixer block consists of a position-wise rotation layer without learnable parameters and an element-wise MLP layer. Repeatedly applying such blocks forms an effective network backbone that mixes the input signals towards the learning targets. We have tested ChordMixer on the synthetic adding problem, long document classification, and DNA sequence-based taxonomy classification. The experiment results show that our method substantially outperforms other neural attention models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS), volume 30, 2017.

Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, David Grangier*\n\n**Published in:** Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2020)\t**Cited by** 478  (*Influential: 45*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest, and shows that this model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103, as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 while using fewer self-attention layers.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention has recently been adopted for a wide range of sequence modeling problems. Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers. Additionally, we set a new state-of-the-art on the newly released PG-19 data-set, obtaining a test perplexity of 33.2 with a 22 layer Routing Transformer model trained on sequences of length 8192.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 3. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAurko Roy, Mohammad Saffar, Ashish Vaswani, and David Grangier. 2020.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods.

Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformers*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.

Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models for sequence modeling*\n\n*Jimmy Smith, Andrew Warrington, Scott W. Linderman*\n\n**TL;DR:** A state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Models using structured state space sequence (S4) layers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. An S4 layer combines linear state space models (SSMs), the HiPPO framework, and deep learning to achieve high performance. We build on the design of the S4 layer and introduce a new state space layer, the S5 layer. Whereas an S4 layer uses many independent single-input, single-output SSMs, the S5 layer uses one multi-input, multi-output SSM. We establish a connection between S5 and S4, and use this to develop the initialization and parameterization used by the S5 model. The result is a state space layer that can leverage efficient and widely implemented parallel scans, allowing S5 to match the computational efficiency of S4, while also achieving state-of-the-art performance on several long-range sequence modeling tasks. S5 averages 87.4% on the long range arena benchmark, and 98.5% on the most difficult Path-X task.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 334  (*Influential: 32*)\n\n#### 5.

Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Vision Mamba: Efficient Visual Representation Learning with Bidirectional State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models for sequence modeling*\n\n*Lianghui Zhu, Bencheng Liao, Qian Zhang, Xinlong Wang, Wenyu Liu, Xinggang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models and has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently the state space models (SSMs) with efficient hardware-aware designs, i.e., the Mamba deep learning model, have shown great potential for long sequence modeling. Meanwhile building efficient and generic vision backbones purely upon SSMs is an appealing direction. However, representing visual data is challenging for SSMs due to the position-sensitivity of visual data and the requirement of global context for visual understanding. In this paper, we show that the reliance on self-attention for visual representation learning is not necessary and propose a new generic vision backbone with bidirectional Mamba blocks (Vim), which marks the image sequences with position embeddings and compresses the visual representation with bidirectional state space models. On ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation tasks, Vim achieves higher performance compared to well-established vision transformers like DeiT, while also demonstrating significantly improved computation&memory efficiency. For example, Vim is 2.8$\\times$ faster than DeiT and saves 86.8% GPU memory when performing batch inference to extract features on images with a resolution of 1248$\\times$1248. The results demonstrate that Vim is capable of overcoming the computation&memory constraints on performing Transformer-style understanding for high-resolution images and it has great potential to be the next-generation backbone for vision foundation models.

Big Bird: Transformers for Longer Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration transformers sparse attention*\n\n*M. Zaheer, Guru Guruganesh, Kumar Avinava Dubey, J. Ainslie, Chris Alberti, Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n, Philip Pham, Anirudh Ravula, Qifan Wang, Li Yang, Amr Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers-based models, such as BERT, have been one of the most successful deep learning models for NLP. Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1772  (*Influential: 249*)\n\n#### 8. DynamicViT: Efficient Vision Transformers with Dynamic Token Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration transformers sparse attention*\n\n*Yongming Rao, Wenliang Zhao, Benlin Liu, Jiwen Lu, Jie Zhou, Cho-Jui Hsieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input and an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is sparse in vision transformers. We observe the final prediction in vision transformers is only based on a subset of most informative tokens, which is sufficient for accurate image recognition. Based on this observation, we propose a dynamic token sparsification framework to prune redundant tokens progressively and dynamically based on the input. Specifically, we devise a lightweight prediction module to estimate the importance score of each token given the current features. The module is added to different layers to prune redundant tokens hierarchically. To optimize the prediction module in an end-to-end manner, we propose an attention masking strategy to differentiably prune a token by blocking its interactions with other tokens. Benefiting from the nature of self-attention, the unstructured sparse tokens are still hardware friendly, which makes our framework easy to achieve actual speed-up. By hierarchically pruning 66% of the input tokens, our method greatly reduces 31%~37% FLOPs and improves the throughput by over 40% while the drop of accuracy is within 0.5% for various vision transformers. Equipped with the dynamic token sparsification framework, DynamicViT models can achieve very competitive complexity/accuracy trade-offs compared to state-of-the-art CNNs and vision transformers on ImageNet.

Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration transformers sparse attention*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Kaizhao Liang, Jiaming Yang, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Adapt or Perish: Adaptive Sparse Transformer with Attentive Feature Refinement for Image Restoration\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformers*\n\n*Jufeng Yang, Jinglei Shi, Jinshan Pan, Duosheng Chen, Shihao Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:**     Transformer-based approaches have achieved promising performance in image restoration tasks given their ability to model long-range dependencies which is crucial for recovering clear images. Though diverse efficient attention mechanism designs have addressed the intensive computations associated with using transformers they often involve redundant information and noisy interactions from irrelevant regions by considering all available tokens. In this work we propose an Adaptive Sparse Transformer (AST) to mitigate the noisy interactions of irrelevant areas and remove feature redundancy in both spatial and channel domains. AST comprises two core designs i.e. an Adaptive Sparse Self-Attention (ASSA) block and a Feature Refinement Feed-forward Network (FRFN). Specifically ASSA is adaptively computed using a two-branch paradigm where the sparse branch is introduced to filter out the negative impacts of low query-key matching scores for aggregating features while the dense one ensures sufficient information flow through the network for learning discriminative representations. Meanwhile FRFN employs an enhance-and-ease scheme to eliminate feature redundancy in channels enhancing the restoration of clear latent images. Experimental results on commonly used benchmarks have demonstrated the versatility and competitive performance of our method in several tasks including rain streak removal real haze removal and raindrop removal.

OA-CNNs: Omni-Adaptive Sparse CNNs for 3D Semantic Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive sparse attention transformers*\n\n*Jiaya Jia, Zhuotao Tian, Hengshuang Zhao, Yukang Chen, Li Jiang, Xiaoyang Wu, Bohao Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** The booming of 3D recognition in the 2020s began with the introduction of point cloud transformers. They quickly overwhelmed sparse CNNs and became state-of-the-art models, especially in 3D semantic segmentation. However, sparse CNNs are still valuable networks, due to their efficiency treasure, and ease of application. In this work, we reexamine the design distinctions and test the limits of what a sparse CNN can achieve. We discover that the key credit to the performance difference is adaptivity. Specifically, we propose two key components, i.e., adaptive receptive fields (spatially) and adaptive relation, to bridge the gap. This exploration led to the creation of Omni-Adaptive 3D CNNs (OA-CNNs), a family of networks that integrates a lightweight module to greatly enhance the adaptivity of sparse CNNs at minimal computational cost. Without any self-attention modules, OA-CNNs favorably surpass point transformers in terms of accuracy in both indoor and outdoor scenes, with much less latency and memory cost. Notably, it achieves 76.1%, 78.9%, and 70.6% mIoU on ScanNet v2, nuScenes, and SemanticKITTI validation benchmarks respectively, while maintaining at most 5x better speed than transformer counterparts. This revelation highlights the potential of pure sparse CNNs to outperform transformer-related networks.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-21\n\n\n\n#### 3. Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models for sequence modeling*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Karan Goel, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** A central goal of sequence modeling is designing a single principled model that can address sequence data across a range of modalities and tasks, particularly on long-range dependencies. Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n**Conference:** efficiently-modeling-long-sequences-with\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state-space models for sequence modeling*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Tuo Zhao, Eren Manavoglu, Denis Charles, Jian Jiao, Xiaodong Liu, Simiao Zuo*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models have achieved superior performance in various natural language processing tasks. However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. SparseTIR: Composable Abstractions for Sparse Compilation in Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration transformers sparse attention*\n\n*Luis Ceze, Tianqi Chen, Junru Shao, Ruihang Lai, Zihao Ye*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse tensors are rapidly becoming critical components of modern deep learning workloads. However, developing high-performance sparse operators can be difficult and tedious, and existing vendor libraries cannot satisfy the escalating demands from new operators. Sparse tensor compilers simplify the development of operators, but efficient sparse compilation for deep learning remains challenging because a single sparse format cannot maximize hardware efficiency, and single-shot compilers cannot keep up with latest hardware and system advances. In this paper, we observe that the key to addressing both these challenges is to leverage composable formats and composable transformations. We propose SparseTIR, a sparse tensor compilation abstraction that offers composable formats and composable transformations for deep learning workloads. SparseTIR constructs a search space over these composable components for performance tuning. With these improvements, SparseTIR obtains consistent performance speedups vs vendor libraries on GPUs for single operators: 1.20-2.34x for GNN operators, 1.05-2.98x for sparse attention operators, and 0.56-7.45x for sparse convolution operators. SparseTIR also accelerates end-to-end GNNs by 1.08-1.52x for GraphSAGE training, and 4.20-40.18x for RGCN inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. Fast Inner-Product Algorithms and Architectures for Deep Neural Network Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware acceleration transformers sparse attention*\n\n*Nicola Nicolici, Trevor E. Pogue*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a new algorithm called the Free-pipeline Fast Inner Product (FFIP) and its hardware architecture that improve an under-explored fast inner-product algorithm (FIP) proposed by Winograd in 1968. Unlike the unrelated Winograd minimal filtering algorithms for convolutional layers, FIP is applicable to all machine learning (ML) model layers that can mainly decompose to matrix multiplication, including fully-connected, convolutional, recurrent, and attention/transformer layers. We implement FIP for the first time in an ML accelerator then present our FFIP algorithm and generalized architecture which inherently improve FIP's clock frequency and, as a consequence, throughput for a similar hardware cost. Finally, we contribute ML-specific optimizations for the FIP and FFIP algorithms and architectures. We show that FFIP can be seamlessly incorporated into traditional fixed-point systolic array ML accelerators to achieve the same throughput with half the number of multiply-accumulate (MAC) units, or it can double the maximum systolic array size that can fit onto devices with a fixed hardware budget. Our FFIP implementation for non-sparse ML models with 8 to 16-bit fixed-point inputs achieves higher throughput and compute efficiency than the best-in-class prior solutions on the same type of compute platform.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-20\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Understanding the Researcher's Goal and Intent\n\nThe researcher is aiming to develop a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically focusing on enhancing the efficiency and performance of transformer models through innovative attention mechanisms.

Similarly, **Sparse Transformers** and **Reformer** utilize sparse attention patterns and efficient computation methods to handle long sequences.\n\n     The proposed RSLA introduces a learnable routing network and block-wise sparse computation, which are approaches also present in existing models. For instance, **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)** in **Ren et al., 2023** employs dynamic sparse activation with block-wise processing for efficiency.\n\n     Therefore, the RSLA proposal lacks sufficient novelty compared to existing research and may not offer significant unique contributions.\n\n   - **Implementation Feasibility:**\n\n     Implementing differentiable routing can introduce computational overhead and complicate training. Ensuring efficient gradient computation and stable training is challenging. The block-wise processing and dynamic sparsity require careful optimization to prevent inefficiencies.\n\n     Moreover, existing models have already addressed these challenges, and implementing RSLA may not provide practical advantages over established methods.\n\n   - **Impact on Accuracy, Robustness, Efficiency, and Scalability:**\n\n     - **Accuracy and Expressiveness:** While RSLA aims to enhance expressiveness by focusing on important dependencies, existing models like **Routing Transformers** have already demonstrated this capability. Without empirical evidence, it is unclear if RSLA significantly improves upon them.\n\n     - **Efficiency and Scalability:** The added complexity of the routing mechanism may offset efficiency gains from sparsity and block-wise computation. Existing models have optimized these aspects, and RSLA may not offer substantial improvements.\n\n     - **Robustness:** Dynamic routing could improve robustness by adapting to varying input patterns, but this benefit has been explored in prior work.\n\n     - **Hardware-Aware Design:** While the proposal mentions hardware-aware optimization, practical implementation details are lacking, making it difficult to assess the effectiveness.\n\n   - **Overlap with Internal Proposals:**\n\n     The proposal is a refinement of a previous submission that failed the review with a low rating. Despite changes, the core concept remains similar, and the concerns about novelty and originality persist.\n\n   - **Potential for Improvement:**\n\n     To differentiate RSLA from existing models, the proposal could explore novel routing mechanisms, introduce unique sparsity patterns, or combine methodologies in an innovative way.

Models like **Routing Transformers** (Roy et al., 2020) have already introduced content-based sparse attention using routing mechanisms. More recent works, such as **SBM-Transformers** (Cho et al., 2022), further enhance this concept by using stochastic block models to data-adaptively sample attention patterns.\n\n     The **RSLA** proposal overlaps significantly with these existing models in both concept and implementation. The use of block-wise computation and hardware-aware optimizations is also a common theme in the literature (e.g., Lou et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2023). Therefore, the proposal lacks sufficient novelty unless it introduces a fundamentally different approach or demonstrates significant empirical improvements.\n\n   - **Implementation Feasibility:**\n\n     Implementing differentiable routing and sparse computations introduces challenges in terms of computational overhead and training stability. While the proposal mentions efficient backward pass and hardware optimization, it lacks detailed strategies to address these challenges.\n\n     Existing models have tackled similar issues, and without specific innovations, RSLA may not provide practical advantages over established methods.\n\n   - **Impact on Model Performance:**\n\n     - **Accuracy and Expressiveness:** The proposal aims to enhance expressiveness by focusing computation on important dependencies. However, without empirical evidence or theoretical justification, it's unclear if RSLA offers improvements over models like SBM-Transformer or Sparse Modular Activation (SMA).\n\n     - **Efficiency and Scalability:** The added complexity from routing mechanisms may negate efficiency gains from sparse computations. Existing models have optimized these aspects, and RSLA needs to demonstrate clear advantages.\n\n   - **Potential Directions for Improvement:**\n\n     To enhance the novelty and impact of the proposal, consider:\n\n     - **Incorporating State Space Models (SSMs):** Explore integrating SSMs with sparse attention to handle long sequences more effectively, as in Smith et al.

Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models have achieved superior performance on various natural language processing tasks such as language modeling (Dai et al., 2019), natural language generation (Brown et al., 2020) and natural language understanding (Devlin et al., 2019; He et al., 2021). These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 3. Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token.

If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

We propose LOCOST: an encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models for conditional text generation with long context inputs. With a computational complexity of \\mathcal{O}(L \\log L), this architecture can handle significantly longer sequences than state-of-the-art models that are based on sparse attention patterns. We evaluate our model on a series of long document abstractive summarization tasks. The model reaches a performance level that is 93-96% comparable to the top-performing sparse transformers of the same size while saving up to 50% memory during training and up to 87% during inference. Additionally, LOCOST effectively handles input texts exceeding 600K tokens at inference time, setting new state-of-the-art results on full-book summarization and opening new perspectives for long input processing.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/30 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nAs key examples, Guo et al. (2022) and Zaheer et al. (2020) extended the context capacity of encoderdecoder models (Raffel et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) and showed drastic increases in the performance on long text summarization, motivating the quest to incorporate longer contexts. However, in practice, even the best sparse-transformers need heavy computational resources to handle sequences of length larger than 8 K tokens (see Figure 4). Deep state-space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2022b) have been proposed for sequence processing, with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$, initially for computer vision and audio and more recently for text. Their recurrent architectures are designed for capturing long-range dependencies (Gu et al., 2020). Up to now, their applications have been restrained to either unconditional autoregressive generation, i.e., with a decoder-only (Fu et al., 2023; Goel et al., 2022) ; or sequence classification, i.e., with an encoder-only (Gu et al., 2022b,a; Nguyen et al., 2022). Tackling conditional text generation with SSMs as required e.g. for summarization remains yet unexplored. In this paper, we propose LOCOST an encoder-\ndecoder architecture to explore the performance of SSMs for conditional text generation tasks, through the lens of abstractive summarization. We demonstrate that SSMs can be competitive with transformer-based models while drastically reducing their memory requirements. We opt for a lightweight architecture design, comparable to the average base transformers (roughly 250M parameters) in order to process extremely long sequences on standard compute resources. Our experimentations with extremely long sequences yield stateof-the-art results on the challenging BookSumBook. With an increase of up to 2 points in average ROUGE score compared to sparse attention baselines, our model is able to process entire books, without truncation, and on a single GPU. Our contributions are threefold:\n\n- We propose a new encoder-decoder architecture based on state-space models. By bypassing the self-attention mechanism used in transformers, the model enjoys a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ instead of $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ as in traditional transformers. - Compared with the best-performing sparse transformers of the same size, the model achieves $93-96 \\%$ of the best performance on various long document abstractive summarization while being up to $50 \\%$ more memory-efficient during training and up to $87 \\%$ at inference time, see Figure 1. - The model is able to process entire input sequences of up to 600 K tokens, a length far out of reach for sparse transformers. This allows the model to achieve a new state-of-the-art on a challenging full-book summarization task. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first encoder-decoder that performs competitively with sparse transformers with no attention in the encoder. Furthermore, this work represents the first successful attempt at processing extremely long texts e.g. entire books without any truncation, all in a single pass. The proposed model opens new perspectives for addressing long texts with lesser resources.*\n\n## 2 Related Work\n\nIn this section, we first review memory-efficient transformers and existing alternatives to the attention mechanism. Then, we discuss recent literature on state-space models. [^1]Memory efficiency for transformers. Reducing the memory consumption of transformers is an active research field. Optimization at the hardware level (Dao et al., 2022) helped to improve the scaling of the attention computation on recent GPUs. A line of work considers retrieving-augmented transformers, like (Borgeaud et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2023), that use additional modules to enhance the language modeling backbone. While crucial in developing memory-efficient architectures, we consider these last two topics as being orthogonal to our work that focuses on the models' architecture. Profuse literature focuses on tailoring the models' architecture for long inputs. Since the computational complexity of attention comes from the computation of the self-attention matrix, a straightforward way to reduce its cost is to approximate it using sparse-attention patterns. These patterns typically incorporate a combination of local attention and a set of carefully selected tokens. For instance, in addition to global tokens, BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020) considers random tokens, while LSG (Condevaux and Harispe, 2023) considers sparse tokens through various strategy of sparsification. LongT5 (Guo et al., 2022) chunks the sequence into blocks and averages their representations, which gives a number of global tokens equal to the number of blocks. An overview of the complexity of various sparse-transformers can be found in Table 1. In contrast, we propose an alternative, computationally efficient architecture, without the need of costly self-attention blocks nor sparse-attention patterns. Attention-free transformers. Some variants of transformers already avoid the standard attention mechanism. For example Katharopoulos et al. (2020); Hua et al. (2022) approximate the softmax similarity in the attention by a more efficient computation. More recently, mixing architectures were introduced in (Liu et al., 2021). They are the main component of the FNet (Lee-Thorp et al., 2022) model, an encoder that replaces self-attention with a Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). FNet has a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log L)$ and is an encoder-only model, thus restricted to classification and regression tasks. Our proposed model also bypasses attention in the encoder, reaching the same computational complexity as encoders such as FNet, while being a much more versatile model, specifically designed for conditional text generation. | Encoder architecture | Complexity per layer |\n| :--- | :---: |\n| Transformer (full) | $\\mathcal{O}\\left(L^{2}\\right)$ |\n| LED | $\\mathcal{O}(L w)$ |\n| BigBird | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+r))$ |\n| LSG | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L(g+s))$ |\n| LongT5 (TGlobal) | $\\mathcal{O}(L w+L\\lfloor L / c\\rfloor)$ |\n| LOCOST | $\\mathcal{O}(L \\log (L))$ |\n\nTable 1: Computational complexity per encoder layer as a function of the input length $L$, the local window size $w$ (typically set to 256 tokens), the number of global tokens $g$, random tokens $r$, sparse tokens $s$ and the chunk size $c$.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 44 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 10 raw search queries input to the search frame: innovative sparse attention mechanisms, state-space models in transformers, implicit attention in sequence models, hardware-efficient transformer architectures, graph attention networks transformers, expander graphs neural networks, theoretical frameworks for attention mechanisms, foundations of efficient sequence modeling, transformer optimization for GPUs, efficient transformer inference TPUs\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 25 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Distributions in each of these families have fixed support. In contrast, for finite domains, there has been recent work on sparse alternatives to softmax (e.g. sparsemax and alpha-entmax), which have varying support, being able to assign zero probability to irrelevant categories. This paper expands that work in two directions: first, we extend alpha-entmax to continuous domains, revealing a link with Tsallis statistics and deformed exponential families. Second, we introduce continuous-domain attention mechanisms, deriving efficient gradient backpropagation algorithms for alpha in {1,2}. Experiments on attention-based text classification, machine translation, and visual question answering illustrate the use of continuous attention in 1D and 2D, showing that it allows attending to time intervals and compact regions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

This leads us to ponder the computational advantages and functional role of these \u201cgrandmother cells.\" Here, we propose that such cells can serve as prototype memory priors that bias and shape the distributed feature processing during the image generation process in the brain. These memory prototypes are learned by momentum online clustering and are utilized through a memory-based attention operation. Integrating this mechanism, we propose Memory Concept Attention ( MoCA ) to improve few shot image generation quality. We show that having a prototype memory with attention mechanisms can improve image synthesis quality, learn interpretable visual concept clusters, and improve the robustness of the model.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

On the Parameterization and Initialization of Diagonal State Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Ankit Gupta, Karan Goel, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically describes various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and performs a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSM) have recently been shown to be very effective as a deep learning layer as a promising alternative to sequence models such as RNNs, CNNs, or Transformers. The first version to show this potential was the S4 model, which is particularly effective on tasks involving long-range dependencies by using a prescribed state matrix called the HiPPO matrix. While this has an interpretable mathematical mechanism for modeling long dependencies, it introduces a custom representation and algorithm that can be difficult to implement. On the other hand, a recent variant of S4 called DSS showed that restricting the state matrix to be fully diagonal can still preserve the performance of the original model when using a specific initialization based on approximating S4's matrix. This work seeks to systematically understand how to parameterize and initialize such diagonal state space models. While it follows from classical results that almost all SSMs have an equivalent diagonal form, we show that the initialization is critical for performance. We explain why DSS works mathematically, by showing that the diagonal restriction of S4's matrix surprisingly recovers the same kernel in the limit of infinite state dimension. We also systematically describe various design choices in parameterizing and computing diagonal SSMs, and perform a controlled empirical study ablating the effects of these choices. Our final model S4D is a simple diagonal version of S4 whose kernel computation requires just 2 lines of code and performs comparably to S4 in almost all settings, with state-of-the-art results for image, audio, and medical time-series domains, and averaging 85\\% on the Long Range Arena benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 216  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 7. Hyena Hierarchy: Towards Larger Convolutional Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: implicit attention in sequence models*\n\n*Michael Poli, Stefano Massaroli, Eric Q. Nguyen, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao, S. Baccus, Y. Bengio, Stefano Ermon, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating, and sets a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in deep learning have relied heavily on the use of large Transformers due to their ability to learn at scale. However, the core building block of Transformers, the attention operator, exhibits quadratic cost in sequence length, limiting the amount of context accessible. Existing subquadratic methods based on low-rank and sparse approximations need to be combined with dense attention layers to match Transformers, indicating a gap in capability. In this work, we propose Hyena, a subquadratic drop-in replacement for attention constructed by interleaving implicitly parametrized long convolutions and data-controlled gating. In recall and reasoning tasks on sequences of thousands to hundreds of thousands of tokens, Hyena improves accuracy by more than 50 points over operators relying on state-spaces and other implicit and explicit methods, matching attention-based models. We set a new state-of-the-art for dense-attention-free architectures on language modeling in standard datasets (WikiText103 and The Pile), reaching Transformer quality with a 20% reduction in training compute required at sequence length 2K. Hyena operators are twice as fast as highly optimized attention at sequence length 8K, and 100x faster at sequence length 64K.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 212  (*Influential: 37*)\n\n#### 8.

Baccus, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level, an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Genomic (DNA) sequences encode an enormous amount of information for gene regulation and protein synthesis. Similar to natural language models, researchers have proposed foundation models in genomics to learn generalizable features from unlabeled genome data that can then be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as identifying regulatory elements. Due to the quadratic scaling of attention, previous Transformer-based genomic models have used 512 to 4k tokens as context (<0.001% of the human genome), significantly limiting the modeling of long-range interactions in DNA. In addition, these methods rely on tokenizers to aggregate meaningful DNA units, losing single nucleotide resolution where subtle genetic variations can completely alter protein function via single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Recently, Hyena, a large language model based on implicit convolutions was shown to match attention in quality while allowing longer context lengths and lower time complexity. Leveraging Hyenas new long-range capabilities, we present HyenaDNA, a genomic foundation model pretrained on the human reference genome with context lengths of up to 1 million tokens at the single nucleotide-level, an up to 500x increase over previous dense attention-based models. HyenaDNA scales sub-quadratically in sequence length (training up to 160x faster than Transformer), uses single nucleotide tokens, and has full global context at each layer. We explore what longer context enables - including the first use of in-context learning in genomics for simple adaptation to novel tasks without updating pretrained model weights. On fine-tuned benchmarks from the Nucleotide Transformer, HyenaDNA reaches state-of-the-art (SotA) on 12 of 17 datasets using a model with orders of magnitude less parameters and pretraining data. On the GenomicBenchmarks, HyenaDNA surpasses SotA on all 8 datasets on average by +9 accuracy points.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 123  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n#### 9. Transformer Language Models without Positional Encodings Still Learn Positional Information\n\n*From Search Query: implicit attention in sequence models*\n\n*Adi Haviv, Ori Ram, Ofir Press, Peter Izsak, Omer Levy*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that LMs without any explicit positional encoding are still competitive with standard models, and that this phenomenon is robust across different datasets, model sizes, and sequence lengths.\n\n**Abstract:** Causal transformer language models (LMs), such as GPT-3, typically require some form of positional encoding, such as positional embeddings. However, we show that LMs without any explicit positional encoding are still competitive with standard models, and that this phenomenon is robust across different datasets, model sizes, and sequence lengths. Probing experiments reveal that such models acquire an implicit notion of absolute positions throughout the network, effectively compensating for the missing information. We conjecture that causal attention enables the model to infer the number of predecessors that each token can attend to, thereby approximating its absolute position. Our findings indicate that causal LMs might derive positional awareness not only from the explicit positioning mechanism, but also from the effects of the causal mask.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 83  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 10. LiteTransformerSearch: Training-free Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient transformer architectures*\n\n*Mojan Javaheripi, Gustavo de Rosa, Subhabrata Mukherjee, S. Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 11. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient transformer architectures*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 70  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 12. No Train No Gain: Revisiting Efficient Training Algorithms For Transformer-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient transformer architectures*\n\n*Jean Kaddour, Oscar Key, Piotr Nawrot, Pasquale Minervini, Matt J. Kusner*\n\n**TL;DR:** An evaluation protocol is defined that enables computation to be done on arbitrary machines by mapping all computation time to a reference machine which is called reference system time and is discussed in this work.\n\n**Abstract:** The computation necessary for training Transformer-based language models has skyrocketed in recent years. This trend has motivated research on efficient training algorithms designed to improve training, validation, and downstream performance faster than standard training. In this work, we revisit three categories of such algorithms: dynamic architectures (layer stacking, layer dropping), batch selection (selective backprop, RHO loss), and efficient optimizers (Lion, Sophia). When pre-training BERT and T5 with a fixed computation budget using such methods, we find that their training, validation, and downstream gains vanish compared to a baseline with a fully-decayed learning rate. We define an evaluation protocol that enables computation to be done on arbitrary machines by mapping all computation time to a reference machine which we call reference system time. We discuss the limitations of our proposed protocol and release our code to encourage rigorous research in efficient training procedures: https://github.com/JeanKaddour/NoTrainNoGain.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 31  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 13. Edgeformers: Graph-Empowered Transformers for Representation Learning on Textual-Edge Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph attention networks transformers*\n\n*Bowen Jin, Yu Zhang, Yu Meng, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and nodes representations, respectively.\n\n**Abstract:** Edges in many real-world social/information networks are associated with rich text information (e.g., user-user communications or user-product reviews). However, mainstream network representation learning models focus on propagating and aggregating node attributes, lacking specific designs to utilize text semantics on edges. While there exist edge-aware graph neural networks, they directly initialize edge attributes as a feature vector, which cannot fully capture the contextualized text semantics of edges. In this paper, we propose Edgeformers, a framework built upon graph-enhanced Transformers, to perform edge and node representation learning by modeling texts on edges in a contextualized way. Specifically, in edge representation learning, we inject network information into each Transformer layer when encoding edge texts; in node representation learning, we aggregate edge representations through an attention mechanism within each node's ego-graph. On five public datasets from three different domains, Edgeformers consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines in edge classification and link prediction, demonstrating the efficacy in learning edge and node representations, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 14. Specformer: Spectral Graph Neural Networks Meet Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: graph attention networks transformers*\n\n*Deyu Bo, Chuan Shi, Lele Wang, Renjie Liao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter and design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** Spectral graph neural networks (GNNs) learn graph representations via spectral-domain graph convolutions. However, most existing spectral graph filters are scalar-to-scalar functions, i.e., mapping a single eigenvalue to a single filtered value, thus ignoring the global pattern of the spectrum. Furthermore, these filters are often constructed based on some fixed-order polynomials, which have limited expressiveness and flexibility. To tackle these issues, we introduce Specformer, which effectively encodes the set of all eigenvalues and performs self-attention in the spectral domain, leading to a learnable set-to-set spectral filter. We also design a decoder with learnable bases to enable non-local graph convolution. Importantly, Specformer is equivariant to permutation. By stacking multiple Specformer layers, one can build a powerful spectral GNN. On synthetic datasets, we show that our Specformer can better recover ground-truth spectral filters than other spectral GNNs. Extensive experiments of both node-level and graph-level tasks on real-world graph datasets show that our Specformer outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and learns meaningful spectrum patterns.

However, due to the quadratic self-attention complexity, most of the pretrained Transformers models can only handle relatively short text. It is still a challenge when it comes to modeling very long documents. In this work, we propose to use a graph attention network on top of the available pretrained Transformers model to learn document embeddings. This graph attention network allows us to leverage the high-level semantic structure of the document. In addition, based on our graph document model, we design a simple contrastive learning strategy to pretrain our models on a large amount of unlabeled corpus. Empirically, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in document classification and document retrieval tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 16. Revisiting Pruning at Initialization Through the Lens of Ramanujan Graph\n\n*From Search Query: expander graphs neural networks*\n\n*Duc L. N. Hoang, Shiwei Liu, R. Marculescu, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is observed that not only the Ramanujan property for sparse networks shows no significant relationship to PaI\u2019s relative performance, but maximizing it can also lead to the formation of pseudo-random graphs with no structural meanings.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning neural networks at initialization (PaI) has received an upsurge of interest due to its end-to-end saving potential. PaI is able to find sparse subnetworks at initialization that can achieve comparable performance to the full networks. These methods can surpass the trivial baseline of random pruning but suffer from a significant performance gap compared to post-training pruning. Previous approaches firmly rely on weights, gradients, and sanity checks as primary signals when conducting PaI analysis. To better understand the underlying mechanism of PaI, we propose to interpret it through the lens of the Ramanujan Graph - a class of expander graphs that are sparse while being highly connected. It is often believed there should be a strong correlation between the Ramanujan graph and PaI since both are about finding sparse and well-connected neural networks. However, the finer-grained link relating highly sparse and connected networks to their relative performance ( i.e. , ranking of difference sparse structures at the same specific global sparsity) is still missing. We observe that not only the Ramanujan property for sparse networks shows no significant relationship to PaI\u2019s relative performance, but maximizing it can also lead to the formation of pseudo-random graphs with no structural meanings. We reveal the underlying cause to be Ramanujan Graph\u2019s strong assumption on the upper bound of the largest nontrivial eigenvalue ( \u02c6 \u00b5 ) of layers belonging to highly sparse networks. We hence propose Iterative Mean Difference of Bound (IMDB) as a mean to relax the \u02c6 \u00b5 upper bound. Likewise, we also show there exists a lower bound for \u02c6 \u00b5 , which we call the Normalized Random Coefficient (NaRC), that gives us an accurate assessment for when sparse but highly connected\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 17.

We present a formulation of CNNs in the context of spectral graph theory, which provides the necessary mathematical background and efficient numerical schemes to design fast localized convolutional filters on graphs.

Generalization Analysis of Message Passing Neural Networks on Large Random Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: expander graphs neural networks*\n\n*Sohir Maskey, R. Levie, Yunseok Lee, Gitta Kutyniok*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown how a MPNN with high complexity can generalize from a small dataset of graphs, as long as the graphs are large.\n\n**Abstract:** Message passing neural networks (MPNN) have seen a steep rise in popularity since their introduction as generalizations of convolutional neural networks to graph-structured data, and are now considered state-of-the-art tools for solving a large variety of graph-focused problems. We study the generalization error of MPNNs in graph classification and regression. We assume that graphs of different classes are sampled from different random graph models. We show that, when training a MPNN on a dataset sampled from such a distribution, the generalization gap increases in the complexity of the MPNN, and decreases, not only with respect to the number of training samples, but also with the average number of nodes in the graphs. This shows how a MPNN with high complexity can generalize from a small dataset of graphs, as long as the graphs are large. The generalization bound is derived from a uniform convergence result, that shows that any MPNN, applied on a graph, approximates the MPNN applied on the geometric model that the graph discretizes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 19.

Existing studies have developed spatiotemporal prediction neural networks based on the PC theory, emulating its two core mechanisms: Correcting predictions from residuals and hierarchical learning. However, these models do not show the enhancement of prediction skills on real-world forecasting tasks and ignore the Precision Weighting mechanism of PC theory. The precision weighting mechanism posits that the brain allocates more attention to signals with lower precision, contributing to the cognitive ability of human brains. This work introduces the Cognitive Diffusion Probabilistic Models (CogDPM), which demonstrate the connection between diffusion probabilistic models and PC theory. CogDPM features a precision estimation method based on the hierarchical sampling capabilities of diffusion models and weight the guidance with precision weights estimated by the inherent property of diffusion models. We experimentally show that the precision weights effectively estimate the data predictability. We apply CogDPM to real-world prediction tasks using the United Kindom precipitation and ERA surface wind datasets. Our results demonstrate that CogDPM outperforms both existing domain-specific operational models and general deep prediction models by providing more proficient forecasting.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 20. AWESOME: GPU Memory-constrained Long Document Summarization using Memory Mechanism and Global Salient Content\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical frameworks for attention mechanisms*\n\n*Shuyang Cao, Lu Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work aims to leverage the memory-efficient nature of divide-and-conquer methods while preserving global context to produce summaries with improved informativeness, faithfulness, and coherence on longer documents, while having a smaller GPU memory footprint.\n\n**Abstract:** Long document summarization systems are critical for domains with lengthy and jargon-laden text, yet they present significant challenges to researchers and developers with limited computing resources. Existing solutions mainly focus on efficient attentions or divide-and-conquer strategies. The former reduces theoretical time complexity, but is still memory-heavy. The latter methods sacrifice global context, leading to uninformative and incoherent summaries. This work aims to leverage the memory-efficient nature of divide-and-conquer methods while preserving global context. Concretely, our framework AWESOME uses two novel mechanisms: (1) External memory mechanisms track previously encoded document segments and their corresponding summaries, to enhance global document understanding and summary coherence. (2) Global salient content is further identified beforehand to augment each document segment to support its summarization. Extensive experiments on diverse genres of text, including government reports, meeting transcripts, screenplays, scientific papers, and novels, show that AWESOME produces summaries with improved informativeness, faithfulness, and coherence than competitive baselines on longer documents, while having a smaller GPU memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 21.

Under the slogan of differentiable programming, there is an increasing demand for efficient automatic gradient computation for emerging network architectures that incorporate dynamic control flow, especially in NLP. In this paper we propose an implementation of backpropagation using functions with callbacks, where the forward pass is executed as a sequence of function calls, and the backward pass as a corresponding sequence of function returns. A key realization is that this technique of chaining callbacks is well known in the programming languages community as continuation-passing style (CPS). Any program can be converted to this form using standard techniques, and hence, any program can be mechanically converted to compute gradients. Our approach achieves the same flexibility as other reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD) techniques, but it can be implemented without any auxiliary data structures besides the function call stack, and it can easily be combined with graph construction and native code generation techniques through forms of multi-stage programming, leading to a highly efficient implementation that combines the performance benefits of define-then-run software frameworks such as TensorFlow with the expressiveness of define-by-run frameworks such as PyTorch.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 22.

Kwok, Ping Luo, Huchuan Lu, Zhenguo Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** PIXART-$\\alpha$ is introduced, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards.\n\n**Abstract:** The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-$\\alpha$, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024px resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that separately optimize pixel dependency, text-image alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-$\\alpha$'s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART-$\\alpha$ only takes 10.8% of Stable Diffusion v1.5's training time (675 vs. 6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly \\$300,000 (\\$26,000 vs. \\$320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-$\\alpha$ excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-$\\alpha$ will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 177  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n#### 23. ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: transformer optimization for GPUs*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 24.

Towards Efficient Spiking Transformer: a Token Sparsification Framework for Training and Inference Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: efficient transformer inference TPUs*\n\n*Zhengyang Zhuge, Peisong Wang, Xingting Yao, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the token sparsification technique for efficient training of Spiking Transformer and finds conventional methods suffer from noticeable performance degradation, and proposes Sparsification with Timestep-wise Anchor Token and dual Alignments (STATA).\n\n**Abstract:** Nowadays Spiking Transformers have exhibited remarkable performance close to Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs), while enjoying the inherent energy-efficiency of Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). However, training Spiking Trans-formers on GPUs is considerably more time-consuming compared to the ANN counterparts, despite the energy-efficient inference through neuromorphic computation. In this paper, we investigate the token sparsification technique for efficient training of Spiking Transformer and find conventional methods suffer from noticeable performance degradation. We analyze the issue and propose our Sparsification with Timestep-wise Anchor Token and dual Alignments (STATA).

Edge-MoE: Memory-Efficient Multi-Task Vision Transformer Architecture with Task-level Sparsity via Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: innovative sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang, Zhiwen Fan, Hanxue Liang, Rishov Sarkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Computer vision researchers are embracing two promising paradigms: Vision Transformers (ViTs) and Multi-task Learning (MTL), which both show great performance but are computation-intensive, given the quadratic complexity of self-attention in ViT and the need to activate an entire large MTL model for one task. M$^3$ViT is the latest multi-task ViT model that introduces mixture-of-experts (MoE), where only a small portion of subnetworks (\"experts\") are sparsely and dynamically activated based on the current task. M$^3$ViT achieves better accuracy and over 80% computation reduction but leaves challenges for efficient deployment on FPGA. Our work, dubbed Edge-MoE, solves the challenges to introduce the first end-to-end FPGA accelerator for multi-task ViT with a collection of architectural innovations, including (1) a novel reordering mechanism for self-attention, which requires only constant bandwidth regardless of the target parallelism; (2) a fast single-pass softmax approximation; (3) an accurate and low-cost GELU approximation; (4) a unified and flexible computing unit that is shared by almost all computational layers to maximally reduce resource usage; and (5) uniquely for M$^3$ViT, a novel patch reordering method to eliminate memory access overhead. Edge-MoE achieves 2.24x and 4.90x better energy efficiency comparing with GPU and CPU, respectively. A real-time video demonstration is available online, along with our open-source code written using High-Level Synthesis.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. RadarOcc: Robust 3D Occupancy Prediction with 4D Imaging Radar\n\n*From Search Query: innovative sparse attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yunzhou Zhu, Chris Xiaoxuan Lu, Yiming Li, Xiangyu Wen, Fangqiang Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** 3D occupancy-based perception pipeline has significantly advanced autonomous driving by capturing detailed scene descriptions and demonstrating strong generalizability across various object categories and shapes. Current methods predominantly rely on LiDAR or camera inputs for 3D occupancy prediction. These methods are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, limiting the all-weather deployment of self-driving cars. To improve perception robustness, we leverage the recent advances in automotive radars and introduce a novel approach that utilizes 4D imaging radar sensors for 3D occupancy prediction. Our method, RadarOcc, circumvents the limitations of sparse radar point clouds by directly processing the 4D radar tensor, thus preserving essential scene details. RadarOcc innovatively addresses the challenges associated with the voluminous and noisy 4D radar data by employing Doppler bins descriptors, sidelobe-aware spatial sparsification, and range-wise self-attention mechanisms. To minimize the interpolation errors associated with direct coordinate transformations, we also devise a spherical-based feature encoding followed by spherical-to-Cartesian feature aggregation. We benchmark various baseline methods based on distinct modalities on the public K-Radar dataset. The results demonstrate RadarOcc's state-of-the-art performance in radar-based 3D occupancy prediction and promising results even when compared with LiDAR- or camera-based methods. Additionally, we present qualitative evidence of the superior performance of 4D radar in adverse weather conditions and explore the impact of key pipeline components through ablation studies.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. State Space Model for New-Generation Network Alternative to Transformers: A Survey\n\n*From Search Query: state-space models in transformers*\n\n*Jin Tang, Yonghong Tian, YaoWei Wang, Chenglong Li, Bo Jiang, Ziwen Wang, Haoxiang Yang, Shihao Li, Ju Huang, Weizhe Kong, Yao Rong, Wentao Wu, Yuehang Li, Yuhe Ding, Shiao Wang, Xiao Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In the post-deep learning era, the Transformer architecture has demonstrated its powerful performance across pre-trained big models and various downstream tasks. However, the enormous computational demands of this architecture have deterred many researchers. To further reduce the complexity of attention models, numerous efforts have been made to design more efficient methods. Among them, the State Space Model (SSM), as a possible replacement for the self-attention based Transformer model, has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this paper, we give the first comprehensive review of these works and also provide experimental comparisons and analysis to better demonstrate the features and advantages of SSM. Specifically, we first give a detailed description of principles to help the readers quickly capture the key ideas of SSM. After that, we dive into the reviews of existing SSMs and their various applications, including natural language processing, computer vision, graph, multi-modal and multi-media, point cloud/event stream, time series data, and other domains. In addition, we give statistical comparisons and analysis of these models and hope it helps the readers to understand the effectiveness of different structures on various tasks. Then, we propose possible research points in this direction to better promote the development of the theoretical model and application of SSM.

Explaining Modern Gated-Linear RNNs via a Unified Implicit Attention Formulation\n\n*From Search Query: implicit attention in sequence models*\n\n*Lior Wolf, Ameen Ali, Itamar Zimerman*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient sequence modeling have led to attention-free layers, such as Mamba, RWKV, and various gated RNNs, all featuring sub-quadratic complexity in sequence length and excellent scaling properties, enabling the construction of a new type of foundation models. In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art Transformer explainability methods.

VECO: Variable and Flexible Cross-lingual Pre-training for Language Understanding and Generation\n\n*From Search Query: implicit attention in sequence models*\n\n*Luo Si, Fei Huang, Songfang Huang, Bin Bi, Yijia Liu, Jiahao Liu, Wei Wang, Fuli Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing work in multilingual pretraining has demonstrated the potential of cross-lingual transferability by training a unified Transformer encoder for multiple languages. However, much of this work only relies on the shared vocabulary and bilingual contexts to encourage the correlation across languages, which is loose and implicit for aligning the contextual representations between languages. In this paper, we plug a cross-attention module into the Transformer encoder to explicitly build the interdependence between languages. It can effectively avoid the degeneration of predicting masked words only conditioned on the context in its own language. More importantly, when fine-tuning on downstream tasks, the cross-attention module can be plugged in or out on-demand, thus naturally benefiting a wider range of cross-lingual tasks, from language understanding to generation. As a result, the proposed cross-lingual model delivers new state-of-the-art results on various cross-lingual understanding tasks of the XTREME benchmark, covering text classification, sequence labeling, question answering, and sentence retrieval. For cross-lingual generation tasks, it also outperforms all existing cross-lingual models and state-of-the-art Transformer variants on WMT14 English-to-German and English-to-French translation datasets, with gains of up to 1~2 BLEU.\n\n**Conference:** veco-variable-encoder-decoder-pre-training\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-30\n\n\n\n#### 7. LeViT: a Vision Transformer in ConvNet's Clothing for Faster Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient transformer architectures*\n\n*Matthijs Douze, Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Armand Joulin, Pierre Stock, Hugo Touvron, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Ben Graham*\n\n**Abstract:** We design a family of image classification architectures that optimize the trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in a high-speed regime. Our work exploits recent findings in attention-based architectures, which are competitive on highly parallel processing hardware. We revisit principles from the extensive literature on convolutional neural networks to apply them to transformers, in particular activation maps with decreasing resolutions. We also introduce the attention bias, a new way to integrate positional information in vision transformers. As a result, we propose LeVIT: a hybrid neural network for fast inference image classification. We consider different measures of efficiency on different hardware platforms, so as to best reflect a wide range of application scenarios. Our extensive experiments empirically validate our technical choices and show they are suitable to most architectures. Overall, LeViT significantly outperforms existing convnets and vision transformers with respect to the speed/accuracy tradeoff. For example, at 80% ImageNet top-1 accuracy, LeViT is 5 times faster than EfficientNet on CPU.

Rethinking Vision Transformers for MobileNet Size and Speed\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-efficient transformer architectures*\n\n*Jian Ren, Sergey Tulyakov, Yanzhi Wang, Kamyar Salahi, Georgios Evangelidis, Yang Wen, Ju Hu, Yanyu Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of Vision Transformers (ViTs) in computer vision tasks, recent arts try to optimize the performance and complexity of ViTs to enable efficient deployment on mobile devices. Multiple approaches are proposed to accelerate attention mechanism, improve inefficient designs, or incorporate mobile-friendly lightweight convolutions to form hybrid architectures. However, ViT and its variants still have higher latency or considerably more parameters than lightweight CNNs, even true for the years-old MobileNet. In practice, latency and size are both crucial for efficient deployment on resource-constraint hardware. In this work, we investigate a central question, can transformer models run as fast as MobileNet and maintain a similar size? We revisit the design choices of ViTs and propose a novel supernet with low latency and high parameter efficiency. We further introduce a novel fine-grained joint search strategy for transformer models that can find efficient architectures by optimizing latency and number of parameters simultaneously. The proposed models, EfficientFormerV2, achieve 3.5% higher top-1 accuracy than MobileNetV2 on ImageNet-1K with similar latency and parameters. This work demonstrate that properly designed and optimized vision transformers can achieve high performance even with MobileNet-level size and speed.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-15\n\n\n\n#### 9. Universal Graph Transformer Self-Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph attention networks transformers*\n\n*Dinh Phung, Tu Dinh Nguyen, Dai Quoc Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer self-attention network has been extensively used in research domains such as computer vision, image processing, and natural language processing. But it has not been actively used in graph neural networks (GNNs) where constructing an advanced aggregation function is essential. To this end, we present U2GNN, an effective GNN model leveraging a transformer self-attention mechanism followed by a recurrent transition, to induce a powerful aggregation function to learn graph representations. Experimental results show that the proposed U2GNN achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on well-known benchmark datasets for graph classification.

Conversational Question Answering over Knowledge Graphs with Transformer and Graph Attention Networks\n\n*From Search Query: graph attention networks transformers*\n\n*Maria Maleshkova, Jens Lehmann, Harsh Thakkar, Kuldeep Singh, Joan Plepi, Endri Kacupaj*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the task of (complex) conversational question answering over a knowledge graph. For this task, we propose LASAGNE (muLti-task semAntic parSing with trAnsformer and Graph atteNtion nEtworks). It is the first approach, which employs a transformer architecture extended with Graph Attention Networks for multi-task neural semantic parsing. LASAGNE uses a transformer model for generating the base logical forms, while the Graph Attention model is used to exploit correlations between (entity) types and predicates to produce node representations. LASAGNE also includes a novel entity recognition module which detects, links, and ranks all relevant entities in the question context. We evaluate LASAGNE on a standard dataset for complex sequential question answering, on which it outperforms existing baseline averages on all question types. Specifically, we show that LASAGNE improves the F1-score on eight out of ten question types; in some cases, the increase in F1-score is more than 20% compared to the state of the art.\n\n**Proceeding:** eacl-2021-2\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-04\n\n\n\n#### 11. Sparsifying the Update Step in Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: expander graphs neural networks*\n\n*Michalis Vazirgiannis, Changmin Wu, Johannes F. Lutzeyer*\n\n**Abstract:** Message-Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs), the most prominent Graph Neural Network (GNN) framework, celebrate much success in the analysis of graph-structured data. Concurrently, the sparsification of Neural Network models attracts a great amount of academic and industrial interest. In this paper we conduct a structured, empirical study of the effect of sparsification on the trainable part of MPNNs known as the Update step. To this end, we design a series of models to successively sparsify the linear transform in the Update step. Specifically, we propose the ExpanderGNN model with a tuneable sparsification rate and the Activation-Only GNN, which has no linear transform in the Update step. In agreement with a growing trend in the literature the sparsification paradigm is changed by initialising sparse neural network architectures rather than expensively sparsifying already trained architectures. Our novel benchmark models enable a better understanding of the influence of the Update step on model performance and outperform existing simplified benchmark models such as the Simple Graph Convolution. The ExpanderGNNs, and in some cases the Activation-Only models, achieve performance on par with their vanilla counterparts on several downstream tasks, while containing significantly fewer trainable parameters.

Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation for Graph Nets\n\n*From Search Query: expander graphs neural networks*\n\n*Petar Veli\u010dkovi\u0107, Pietro Li\u00f2, Dominique Beaini, Luca Cavalleri, Gabriele Corso*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been shown to be effective models for different predictive tasks on graph-structured data. Recent work on their expressive power has focused on isomorphism tasks and countable feature spaces. We extend this theoretical framework to include continuous features - which occur regularly in real-world input domains and within the hidden layers of GNNs - and we demonstrate the requirement for multiple aggregation functions in this context. Accordingly, we propose Principal Neighbourhood Aggregation (PNA), a novel architecture combining multiple aggregators with degree-scalers (which generalize the sum aggregator). Finally, we compare the capacity of different models to capture and exploit the graph structure via a novel benchmark containing multiple tasks taken from classical graph theory, alongside existing benchmarks from real-world domains, all of which demonstrate the strength of our model. With this work, we hope to steer some of the GNN research towards new aggregation methods which we believe are essential in the search for powerful and robust models.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-12\n\n\n\n#### 13. RobustScanner: Dynamically Enhancing Positional Clues for Robust Text Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical frameworks for attention mechanisms*\n\n*Hongbin Sun, Chenhao Lin, Wayne Zhang, Zhanghui Kuang, Xiaoyu Yue*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention-based encoder-decoder framework has recently achieved impressive results for scene text recognition, and many variants have emerged with improvements in recognition quality. However, it performs poorly on contextless texts (e.g., random character sequences) which is unacceptable in most of real application scenarios. In this paper, we first deeply investigate the decoding process of the decoder. We empirically find that a representative character-level sequence decoder utilizes not only context information but also positional information. Contextual information, which the existing approaches heavily rely on, causes the problem of attention drift. To suppress such side-effect, we propose a novel position enhancement branch, and dynamically fuse its outputs with those of the decoder attention module for scene text recognition. Specifically, it contains a position aware module to enable the encoder to output feature vectors encoding their own spatial positions, and an attention module to estimate glimpses using the positional clue (i.e., the current decoding time step) only. The dynamic fusion is conducted for more robust feature via an element-wise gate mechanism. Theoretically, our proposed method, dubbed \\emph{RobustScanner}, decodes individual characters with dynamic ratio between context and positional clues, and utilizes more positional ones when the decoding sequences with scarce context, and thus is robust and practical. Empirically, it has achieved new state-of-the-art results on popular regular and irregular text recognition benchmarks while without much performance drop on contextless benchmarks, validating its robustness in both contextual and contextless application scenarios.\n\n**Proceeding:** eccv-2020-8\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-15\n\n\n\n#### 14. Exphormer: Sparse Transformers for Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: theoretical frameworks for attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ali Kemal Sinop, Danica J. Sutherland, Balaji Venkatachalam, Ameya Velingker, Hamed Shirzad*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformers have emerged as a promising architecture for a variety of graph learning and representation tasks. Despite their successes, though, it remains challenging to scale graph transformers to large graphs while maintaining accuracy competitive with message-passing networks. In this paper, we introduce Exphormer, a framework for building powerful and scalable graph transformers. Exphormer consists of a sparse attention mechanism based on two mechanisms: virtual global nodes and expander graphs, whose mathematical characteristics, such as spectral expansion, pseduorandomness, and sparsity, yield graph transformers with complexity only linear in the size of the graph, while allowing us to prove desirable theoretical properties of the resulting transformer models. We show that incorporating Exphormer into the recently-proposed GraphGPS framework produces models with competitive empirical results on a wide variety of graph datasets, including state-of-the-art results on three datasets. We also show that Exphormer can scale to datasets on larger graphs than shown in previous graph transformer architectures.

Retentive Network: A Successor to Transformer for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: foundations of efficient sequence modeling*\n\n*Furu Wei, Jianyong Wang, Jilong Xue, Yuqing Xia, Shuming Ma, Shaohan Huang, Li Dong, Yutao Sun*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we propose Retentive Network (RetNet) as a foundation architecture for large language models, simultaneously achieving training parallelism, low-cost inference, and good performance. We theoretically derive the connection between recurrence and attention. Then we propose the retention mechanism for sequence modeling, which supports three computation paradigms, i.e., parallel, recurrent, and chunkwise recurrent. Specifically, the parallel representation allows for training parallelism. The recurrent representation enables low-cost $O(1)$ inference, which improves decoding throughput, latency, and GPU memory without sacrificing performance. The chunkwise recurrent representation facilitates efficient long-sequence modeling with linear complexity, where each chunk is encoded parallelly while recurrently summarizing the chunks. Experimental results on language modeling show that RetNet achieves favorable scaling results, parallel training, low-cost deployment, and efficient inference. The intriguing properties make RetNet a strong successor to Transformer for large language models. Code will be available at https://aka.ms/retnet.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 16. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: foundations of efficient sequence modeling*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 17. AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: transformer optimization for GPUs*\n\n*Song Han, Xingyu Dang, Guangxuan Xiao, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Chuang Gan, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Jiaming Tang, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 18. LightSeq2: Accelerated Training for Transformer-based Models on GPUs\n\n*From Search Query: transformer optimization for GPUs*\n\n*Yufei Ding, Guyue Huang, Mingxuan Wang, Lei LI, Yang Wei, Xian Qian, Ying Xiong, Xiaohui Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based neural models are used in many AI applications. Training these models is expensive, as it takes huge GPU resources and long duration. It is challenging because typical data like sentences have variable lengths, and Transformer's computation patterns are more complex than convolutional neural networks. Existing systems either only focus on model inference or optimization for only BERT-like encoder models. In this paper, we present LightSeq2, a system to accelerate training for a general family of Transformer models on GPUs. We propose a series of GPU optimization techniques tailored to the specific computation flow and memory access patterns of Transformer models. LightSeq2 supports many model architectures, including BERT (encoder-only), GPT (decoder-only), Transformer (encoder-decoder), and vision Transformer. Our experiments for a variety of models and benchmarks show that LightSeq2 is consistently faster (1.4-3.5x) than previous systems on different GPUs. In particular, it gains 308% training speedup compared with existing systems on a large public machine translation benchmark (WMT14 English-German).\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-12\n\n\n\n#### 19.

They can assist compilers in making heuristic decisions or aid autotuners in identifying the optimal configuration for a given program. For example, the autotuner for XLA, a machine learning compiler, discovered 10-20% speedup on state-of-the-art models serving substantial production traffic at Google. Although there exist a few datasets for program performance prediction, they target small sub-programs such as basic blocks or kernels. This paper introduces TpuGraphs, a performance prediction dataset on full tensor programs, represented as computational graphs, running on Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). Each graph in the dataset represents the main computation of a machine learning workload, e.g., a training epoch or an inference step. Each data sample contains a computational graph, a compilation configuration, and the execution time of the graph when compiled with the configuration. The graphs in the dataset are collected from open-source machine learning programs, featuring popular model architectures, e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, Mask R-CNN, and Transformer. TpuGraphs provides 25x more graphs than the largest graph property prediction dataset (with comparable graph sizes), and 770x larger graphs on average compared to existing performance prediction datasets on machine learning programs. This graph-level prediction task on large graphs introduces new challenges in learning, ranging from scalability, training efficiency, to model quality.\n\n**Conference:** tpugraphs-a-performance-prediction-dataset-on\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-25\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that surpasses the performance of existing state-of-the-art models, focusing on aspects such as low perplexity, high accuracy on downstream tasks, robustness, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### Key Intentions and Areas of Focus\n\n1. **Novelty and Innovation**:\n   - The researcher aims to introduce a substantially different mechanism or demonstrate significant improvements over current methods.

            "analysis": "**Analysis Note:**\n\n---\n\n1. **Summary of Analysis:**\n\n   The **RoutedSparseLinearAttention (RSLA)** proposal aims to enhance LinearAttention by integrating differentiable routing mechanisms with sparse computation patterns. The key idea is to introduce learnable routing functions that dynamically determine sparse attention patterns and leverage block-wise computation for memory efficiency and hardware optimization.\n\n   Upon analyzing the proposal alongside recent research and internal prior designs, it becomes evident that similar concepts have been extensively explored in existing literature. Models like **Routing Transformers**, **Sparse Transformers**, **Reformer**, and more recent works from 2022-2024 have proposed various methods for integrating adaptive sparsity, differentiable routing, and hardware-optimized implementations into transformer architectures to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n   Therefore, the RSLA proposal lacks sufficient novelty compared to existing research. To make a meaningful contribution, the proposal needs to introduce a substantially different mechanism or demonstrate significant improvements over current methods.\n\n2. **All Useful References with Excerpts:**\n\n   **a.** **Cho et al., 2022 - \"Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\":**\n\n   > *\"We propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\"*\n\n   **b.** **Lou et al., 2024 - \"Sparser is Faster and Less is More: Efficient Sparse Attention for Long-Range Transformers\":**\n\n   > *\"Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, offering linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation.

This formulation includes most of their sub-components and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods.\"*\n\n3. **Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n   - **Novelty Assessment:**\n\n     The integration of differentiable routing mechanisms with sparse attention patterns in transformer architectures is a well-explored area. Models like **Routing Transformers** (Roy et al., 2020) have already introduced content-based sparse attention using routing mechanisms. More recent works, such as **SBM-Transformers** (Cho et al., 2022), further enhance this concept by using stochastic block models to data-adaptively sample attention patterns.\n\n     The **RSLA** proposal overlaps significantly with these existing models in both concept and implementation. The use of block-wise computation and hardware-aware optimizations is also a common theme in the literature (e.g., Lou et al., 2024; Fu et al., 2023). Therefore, the proposal lacks sufficient novelty unless it introduces a fundamentally different approach or demonstrates significant empirical improvements.\n\n   - **Implementation Feasibility:**\n\n     Implementing differentiable routing and sparse computations introduces challenges in terms of computational overhead and training stability. While the proposal mentions efficient backward pass and hardware optimization, it lacks detailed strategies to address these challenges.\n\n     Existing models have tackled similar issues, and without specific innovations, RSLA may not provide practical advantages over established methods.\n\n   - **Impact on Model Performance:**\n\n     - **Accuracy and Expressiveness:** The proposal aims to enhance expressiveness by focusing computation on important dependencies. However, without empirical evidence or theoretical justification, it's unclear if RSLA offers improvements over models like SBM-Transformer or Sparse Modular Activation (SMA).\n\n     - **Efficiency and Scalability:** The added complexity from routing mechanisms may negate efficiency gains from sparse computations. Existing models have optimized these aspects, and RSLA needs to demonstrate clear advantages.\n\n   - **Potential Directions for Improvement:**\n\n     To enhance the novelty and impact of the proposal, consider:\n\n     - **Incorporating State Space Models (SSMs):** Explore integrating SSMs with sparse attention to handle long sequences more effectively, as in Smith et al. (2022) and Fu et al.

    "abstract": "This proposal introduces AdaptiveBlockLinearAttention (ABLA), a novel enhancement to LinearAttention that leverages structured matrix computation through hierarchical block decomposition and adaptive feature transformation. By introducing learnable block-structured patterns and hardware-efficient computation strategies inspired by state space duality, ABLA achieves improved efficiency and expressiveness while maintaining linear complexity. The design combines insights from recent advances in structured matrices and hardware-aware optimization to create a more efficient attention mechanism.",
