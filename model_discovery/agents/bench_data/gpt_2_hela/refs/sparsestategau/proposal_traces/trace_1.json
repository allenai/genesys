Summary of Search Results and Implications for Novelty and Meaningfulness**\n\nThe \"SparseStateGAU\" proposal introduces a novel architecture designed to enhance language model performance and efficiency by integrating three key components:\n\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA):** Dynamically controls state updates and test-time adaptation through selective computation, reducing unnecessary processing and computational overhead.\n\n- **Efficient State Management:** Implements hardware-efficient state compression techniques to manage memory usage without sacrificing model capabilities, crucial for processing long sequences.\n\n- **IO-Aware Test-Time Adaptation:** Utilizes hardware-efficient algorithms aligned with modern hardware capabilities, such as IO-aware computation patterns, to improve inference speed and efficiency.\n\nComprehensive literature review and analysis indicate that while individual components like sparse activation, test-time adaptation, and efficient state management have been explored separately, their combined integration in the specific manner proposed is novel. Key relevant works include:\n\n- **Dynamic Context Pruning** (Anagnostidis et al., 2023): Discusses dynamic pruning in transformers, relevant to the proposal's SMA component in selective computation and state updates.\n\n- **MoA** (Fu et al., 2024): Proposes a mixture of sparse attention for model compression, aligning with the proposal's focus on computational efficiency through sparsity and dynamic adaptation.\n\n- **QA-LoRA** (Xu et al., 2023): Introduces quantization-aware adaptation, reducing computational resources during fine-tuning and inference, relevant to hardware-aware test-time adaptation.\n\n- **DenseMamba** (He et al., 2024): Explores efficient state management through selective state integration, informing the proposal's state compression strategy.\n\nNo existing work has been found that combines sparse modular activation with hardware-efficient state compression and IO-aware test-time adaptation in language models. This indicates the proposal's novelty and potential meaningfulness in advancing language model design.\n\n---\n\n**2.

We propose the low-rank transformer (LRT), a memory-efficient and fast neural architecture that significantly reduces the parameters and boosts the speed of training and inference for end-to-end speech recognition. Our approach reduces the number of parameters of the network by more than 50% and speeds up the inference time by around 1.35x compared to the baseline transformer model. The experiments show that our LRT model generalizes better and yields lower error rates on both validation and test sets compared to an uncompressed transformer model. The LRT model outperforms those from existing works on several datasets in an end-to-end setting without using an external language model or acoustic data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIEEE, 2019, pp. 7095-7099.

Resurrecting Recurrent Neural Networks for Long Sequences  (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Antonio Orvieto, Samuel L.

Deep state-space models (SSMs) have recently been shown to perform remarkably well on long sequence modeling tasks, and have the added benefits of fast parallelizable training and RNN-like fast inference. However, while SSMs are superficially similar to RNNs, there are important differences that make it unclear where their performance boost over RNNs comes from. In this paper, we show that careful design of deep RNNs using standard signal propagation arguments can recover the impressive performance of deep SSMs on long-range reasoning tasks, while also matching their training speed. To achieve this, we analyze and ablate a series of changes to standard RNNs including linearizing and diagonalizing the recurrence, using better parameterizations and initializations, and ensuring proper normalization of the forward pass. Our results provide new insights on the origins of the impressive performance of deep SSMs, while also introducing an RNN block called the Linear Recurrent Unit that matches both their performance on the Long Range Arena benchmark and their computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/71 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nE.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33: 1474-1487, 2020.

We proposed Megabyte, a multi-scale decoder architecture that enables end-to-end differentiable modeling of sequences of over one million bytes. Megabyte segments sequences into patches and uses a local submodel within patches and a global model between patches. This enables sub-quadratic self-attention, much larger feedforward layers for the same compute, and improved parallelism during decoding -- unlocking better performance at reduced cost for both training and generation. Extensive experiments show that Megabyte allows byte-level models to perform competitively with subword models on long context language modeling, achieve state-of-the-art density estimation on ImageNet, and model audio from raw files. Together, these results establish the viability of tokenization-free autoregressive sequence modeling at scale.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/32 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nd. L., Hendricks, L.

Drop-Bottleneck: Learning Discrete Compressed Representation for Noise-Robust Exploration\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state representation*\n\n*Jaekyeom Kim, Minjung Kim, Dongyeon Woo, Gunhee Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that Drop-Bottleneck outperforms Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) (Alemi et al., 2017) in multiple aspects including adversarial robustness and dimensionality reduction.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel information bottleneck (IB) method named Drop-Bottleneck, which discretely drops features that are irrelevant to the target variable. Drop-Bottleneck not only enjoys a simple and tractable compression objective but also additionally provides a deterministic compressed representation of the input variable, which is useful for inference tasks that require consistent representation. Moreover, it can jointly learn a feature extractor and select features considering each feature dimension's relevance to the target task, which is unattainable by most neural network-based IB methods. We propose an exploration method based on Drop-Bottleneck for reinforcement learning tasks. In a multitude of noisy and reward sparse maze navigation tasks in VizDoom (Kempka et al., 2016) and DMLab (Beattie et al., 2016), our exploration method achieves state-of-the-art performance. As a new IB framework, we demonstrate that Drop-Bottleneck outperforms Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) (Alemi et al., 2017) in multiple aspects including adversarial robustness and dimensionality reduction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2. Modelling Sparse Dynamical Systems with Compressed Predictive State Representations\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state representation*\n\n*William L. Hamilton, M. M. Fard, Joelle Pineau*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new algorithm, called Compressed Predictive State Representation (CPSR), is presented, for learning models of high-dimensional partially observable uncontrolled dynamical systems from small sample sets, that exploits a particular sparse structure present in many domains.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently learning accurate models of dynamical systems is of central importance for developing rational agents that can succeed in a wide range of challenging domains. The difficulty of this learning problem is particularly acute in settings with large observation spaces and partial observability. We present a new algorithm, called Compressed Predictive State Representation (CPSR), for learning models of high-dimensional partially observable uncontrolled dynamical systems from small sample sets. The algorithm exploits a particular sparse structure present in many domains. This sparse structure is used to compress information during learning, allowing for an increase in both the efficiency and predictive power. The compression technique also relieves the burden of domain specific feature selection. We present empirical results showing that the algorithm is able to build accurate models more efficiently than its uncompressed counterparts, and we provide theoretical results on the accuracy of the learned compressed model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state representation*\n\n*Zhiwei Deng, Olga Russakovsky*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

Mahoney*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a general framework for studying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained by injecting noise into hidden states that can be viewed as discretizations of stochastic differential equations driven by input data, and finds that this implicit regularization promotes flatter minima, biases towards models with more stable dynamics, and favors models with larger classification margin.\n\n**Abstract:** We provide a general framework for studying recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained by injecting noise into hidden states. Specifically, we consider RNNs that can be viewed as discretizations of stochastic differential equations driven by input data. This framework allows us to study the implicit regularization effect of general noise injection schemes by deriving an approximate explicit regularizer in the small noise regime. We find that, under reasonable assumptions, this implicit regularization promotes flatter minima; it biases towards models with more stable dynamics; and, in classification tasks, it favors models with larger classification margin.

AntisymmetricRNN: A Dynamical System View on Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent stability*\n\n*B. Chang, Minmin Chen, E. Haber, Ed H. Chi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper draws connections between recurrent networks and ordinary differential equations and proposes a special form of recurrent networks called AntisymmetricRNN, able to capture long-term dependencies thanks to the stability property of its underlying differential equation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have gained widespread use in modeling sequential data. Learning long-term dependencies using these models remains difficult though, due to exploding or vanishing gradients. In this paper, we draw connections between recurrent networks and ordinary differential equations. A special form of recurrent networks called the AntisymmetricRNN is proposed under this theoretical framework, which is able to capture long-term dependencies thanks to the stability property of its underlying differential equation. Existing approaches to improving RNN trainability often incur significant computation overhead. In comparison, AntisymmetricRNN achieves the same goal by design. We showcase the advantage of this new architecture through extensive simulations and experiments. AntisymmetricRNN exhibits much more predictable dynamics. It outperforms regular LSTM models on tasks requiring long-term memory and matches the performance on tasks where short-term dependencies dominate despite being much simpler.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 188  (*Influential: 34*)\n\n#### 6.

Mahoney*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a recurrent unit that describes the hidden state's evolution with two parts: a well-understood linear component plus a Lipschitz nonlinearity, which is more robust with respect to input and parameter perturbations as compared to other continuous-time RNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Viewing recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as continuous-time dynamical systems, we propose a recurrent unit that describes the hidden state's evolution with two parts: a well-understood linear component plus a Lipschitz nonlinearity. This particular functional form facilitates stability analysis of the long-term behavior of the recurrent unit using tools from nonlinear systems theory. In turn, this enables architectural design decisions before experimentation. Sufficient conditions for global stability of the recurrent unit are obtained, motivating a novel scheme for constructing hidden-to-hidden matrices. Our experiments demonstrate that the Lipschitz RNN can outperform existing recurrent units on a range of benchmark tasks, including computer vision, language modeling and speech prediction tasks. Finally, through Hessian-based analysis we demonstrate that our Lipschitz recurrent unit is more robust with respect to input and parameter perturbations as compared to other continuous-time RNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 98  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n#### 7. XLNet: Generalized Autoregressive Pretraining for Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: autoregressive TTT*\n\n*Zhilin Yang, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, J. Carbonell, R. Salakhutdinov, Quoc V. Le*\n\n**TL;DR:** XLNet is proposed, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autore progressive formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** With the capability of modeling bidirectional contexts, denoising autoencoding based pretraining like BERT achieves better performance than pretraining approaches based on autoregressive language modeling. However, relying on corrupting the input with masks, BERT neglects dependency between the masked positions and suffers from a pretrain-finetune discrepancy. In light of these pros and cons, we propose XLNet, a generalized autoregressive pretraining method that (1) enables learning bidirectional contexts by maximizing the expected likelihood over all permutations of the factorization order and (2) overcomes the limitations of BERT thanks to its autoregressive formulation. Furthermore, XLNet integrates ideas from Transformer-XL, the state-of-the-art autoregressive model, into pretraining. Empirically, under comparable experiment settings, XLNet outperforms BERT on 20 tasks, often by a large margin, including question answering, natural language inference, sentiment analysis, and document ranking.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 7774  (*Influential: 911*)\n\n#### 8. Shall We Pretrain Autoregressive Language Models with Retrieval? A Comprehensive Study\n\n*From Search Query: autoregressive TTT*\n\n*Boxin Wang, Wei Ping, P. Xu, Lawrence C. McAfee, Zihan Liu, Mohammad Shoeybi, Yi Dong, Oleksii Kuchaiev, Bo Li, Chaowei Xiao, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**TL;DR:** A comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM of RETRO, which outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration, moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database, and highlights the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large decoder-only language models (LMs) can be largely improved in terms of perplexity by retrieval (e.g., RETRO), but its impact on text generation quality and downstream task accuracy is unclear. Thus, it is still an open question: shall we pretrain large autoregressive LMs with retrieval? To answer it, we perform a comprehensive study on a scalable pre-trained retrieval-augmented LM (i.e., RETRO) compared with standard GPT and retrieval-augmented GPT incorporated at fine-tuning or inference stages. We first provide the recipe to reproduce RETRO up to 9.5B parameters while retrieving a text corpus with 330B tokens. Based on that, we have the following novel findings: i) RETRO outperforms GPT on text generation with much less degeneration (i.e., repetition), moderately higher factual accuracy, and slightly lower toxicity with a nontoxic retrieval database. ii) On the LM Evaluation Harness benchmark, RETRO largely outperforms GPT on knowledge-intensive tasks, but is on par with GPT on other tasks. Furthermore, we introduce a simple variant of the model, RETRO++, which largely improves open-domain QA results of original RETRO (e.g., EM score +8.6 on Natural Question) and significantly outperforms retrieval-augmented GPT in both fine-tuning and zero-shot evaluation settings. Our findings highlight the promising direction of pretraining autoregressive LMs with retrieval as future foundation models.

Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: compressed state representation*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Guokun Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

Recurrent Equilibrium Networks: Flexible Dynamic Models with Guaranteed Stability and Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent stability*\n\n*Ian R. Manchester, Ruigang Wang, Max Revay*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs), a new class of nonlinear dynamical models} for applications in machine learning, system identification and control. The new model class admits ``built in'' behavioural guarantees of stability and robustness. All models in the proposed class are contracting -- a strong form of nonlinear stability -- and models can satisfy prescribed incremental integral quadratic constraints (IQC), including Lipschitz bounds and incremental passivity. RENs are otherwise very flexible: they can represent all stable linear systems, all previously-known sets of contracting recurrent neural networks and echo state networks, all deep feedforward neural networks, and all stable Wiener/Hammerstein models, and can approximate all fading-memory and contracting nonlinear systems. RENs are parameterized directly by a vector in R^N, i.e. stability and robustness are ensured without parameter constraints, which simplifies learning since \\HL{generic methods for unconstrained optimization such as stochastic gradient descent and its variants can be used}. The performance and robustness of the new model set is evaluated on benchmark nonlinear system identification problems, and the paper also presents applications in data-driven nonlinear observer design and control with stability guarantees.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-13\n\n\n\n#### 4. Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: recurrent stability*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. Tail-to-Tail Non-Autoregressive Sequence Prediction for Chinese Grammatical Error Correction\n\n*From Search Query: autoregressive TTT*\n\n*Shuming Shi, Piji Li*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the problem of Chinese Grammatical Error Correction (CGEC) and present a new framework named Tail-to-Tail (\\textbf{TtT}) non-autoregressive sequence prediction to address the deep issues hidden in CGEC. Considering that most tokens are correct and can be conveyed directly from source to target, and the error positions can be estimated and corrected based on the bidirectional context information, thus we employ a BERT-initialized Transformer Encoder as the backbone model to conduct information modeling and conveying. Considering that only relying on the same position substitution cannot handle the variable-length correction cases, various operations such substitution, deletion, insertion, and local paraphrasing are required jointly. Therefore, a Conditional Random Fields (CRF) layer is stacked on the up tail to conduct non-autoregressive sequence prediction by modeling the token dependencies. Since most tokens are correct and easily to be predicted/conveyed to the target, then the models may suffer from a severe class imbalance issue. To alleviate this problem, focal loss penalty strategies are integrated into the loss functions. Moreover, besides the typical fix-length error correction datasets, we also construct a variable-length corpus to conduct experiments. Experimental results on standard datasets, especially on the variable-length datasets, demonstrate the effectiveness of TtT in terms of sentence-level Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Measure on tasks of error Detection and Correction.\n\n**Proceeding:** acl-2021-5\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-03\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on compressed state representation, recurrent stability, and test-time training while maintaining autoregressive causality, here are some specific implementations and empirical results based on the provided keywords and details:\n\n## Matrix Factorization Methods for State Compression in Language Models\n\n- The use of matrix factorization and low-rank approximations is highlighted in the context of state compression. For instance, the \"Compressed Memory States for Efficient Language Models\" concept suggests that matrix factorization can reduce state size significantly while preserving performance. This is achieved by identifying and preserving important state dimensions.\n\n- A novel approach to matrix factorization is discussed in the paper on \"Implicit Bias in Matrix Factorization,\" which introduces a formulation using \\( UDU \\) factorization. This method exhibits an implicit bias toward truly low-rank solutions, which can be beneficial for state compression in language models. The \\( UDU \\) factorization approach ensures that the model explores the entire search space efficiently, leading to more accurate low-rank solutions.\n\n## Layer Normalization and Gradient Stabilization Techniques in Recurrent Architectures\n\n- Layer normalization is a crucial technique for improving stability in recurrent architectures. Applying layer normalization before nonlinearities significantly enhances stability, as noted in \"Stable and Efficient Training of Recurrent Neural Networks.\" This is often combined with gradient clipping and careful initialization to enable the training of very deep recurrent networks [Search Round 1 Analysis Note].\n\n- The Matrix Nuclear-Norm method, while primarily focused on evaluating model compression, also touches on the stability and efficiency of model evaluations. It reduces computational complexity, which can indirectly contribute to more stable training processes by minimizing the need for computationally intensive operations like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).\n\n## Test-Time Training Approaches that Maintain Autoregressive Causality\n\n- Test-time training (TTT) in autoregressive models requires careful handling to maintain causality. The approach outlined in \"Test-Time Training in Autoregressive Models\" involves local gradient updates with a small window of previous tokens. This method allows the model to adapt during inference while preserving the autoregressive structure and causality[Search Round 1 Analysis Note].\n\n- For practical implementation, TTT can be integrated with techniques like low-rank quantization (LRQ) to enhance efficiency. LRQ, discussed in the context of quantization techniques, can help in reducing the number of learnable parameters while maintaining performance. This can be particularly useful when combined with TTT to ensure that the model remains efficient and adaptive during inference.\n\nIn summary:\n\n- **Matrix Factorization**: Methods like \\( UDU \\) factorization and low-rank approximations can significantly reduce state size while preserving performance.\n- **Layer Normalization and Gradient Stabilization**: Layer normalization before nonlinearities, combined with gradient clipping and careful initialization, is key for stability in recurrent architectures [Search Round 1 Analysis Note].\n- **Test-Time Training**: Local gradient updates with a small window of previous tokens maintain autoregressive causality and enable adaptation during inference[Search Round 1 Analysis Note].\n\nThese approaches can be integrated to design more efficient, stable, and adaptive autoregressive language models.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/29 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/48 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nFigures (2, 3, 3, 8).

Optimizing Attention Mechanism Many transformer variants (\"x-formers\") have been introduced to reduce the complexity of transformers (Tay et al., 2022), including sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Kitaev et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2022), approximating the full attention matrix (Wang et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2020), combining chunked attention with gating (Ma et al., 2023) and other efficient methods (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Jaegle et al., 2021). Some recent works like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a) and others (Rabe and Staats, 2022; Jang et al., 2019) share similarities with RWKV's chunked computation scheme. Despite being memory-efficient, their time complexity remains quadratic or contains chunk size as a hidden factor. In contrast, RWKV achieves better space and time complexity during inference by formulating a linear attention as an RNN. Attention Free Models Another line of research replaces the attention mechanism with other modules to scale to long sequences. MLP-Mixer and others (Tolstikhin et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021) propose replacing attention by Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) in computer vision tasks. The Attention Free Transformer (AFT) (Zhai et al., 2021) and HrrFormer (Alam et al., 2023) replaces dot-product self-attention with a computationally efficient alternative. None of these models have been successfully scaled to the point where drawing comparisons with transformer-based large language models makes sense. There has also been substantial research into state space models (SSM) (Gu et al., 2021) and its variants (Dao et al., 2022b; Gupta et al., 2022; Poli et al., 2023). In contrast to the preceding models, SSM and its successors have shown substantial progress towards efficient scaling. Simultaneously with this work, Poli et al. (2023) train SSM-based models with 125 million and 355 million parameters and show that the performance is on-par with a transformer that uses a mix of local and global attention (Black et al., 2021). Advances in RNNs Inspired by the success of transformers, RNN-style (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997; Chung et al., 2014) recursive components have also been modified to increase context length, such as the Recurrent Memory Transformer (Bulatov et al., 2022, 2023) and Linear Recurrent Units (Orvieto et al., 2023). Most similar to our work, the Quasi-Recurrent neural network (QRNN) (Bradbury et al., 2017) uses both convolutional layers and recurrent pooling functions across timesteps and channels. While QRNN utilizes convolutional filters with fixed sizes, RWKV employs a time-mixing module as an attention mechanism with time-decaying factors. Different from the element-wise pooling in QRNN, RWKV includes a parametrized channel-mixing module that is parallelizable. ## D Time-Mixing Block as an RNN Cell\n\nAs stated in 3.3, the RWKV time-mixing block can be formulated as an RNN, as the $W K V$ computation can be written in such a recursive form:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\na_{0}, b_{0} & =0 \\\\\nw k v_{t} & =\\frac{a_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}} \\odot v_{t}}{b_{t-1}+e^{u+k_{t}}} \\\\\na_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot a_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}} \\odot v_{t} \\\\\nb_{t} & =e^{-w} \\odot b_{t-1}+e^{k_{t}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe dataflow of the RNN-like time-mixing is shown in Fig.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: RWKV6 matrix states, efficient state compression, stability analysis\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \\textbf{IN}ternal \\textbf{S}tates for halluc\\textbf{I}nation \\textbf{DE}tection (\\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \\textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Payoff-based learning with matrix multiplicative weights in quantum games\n\n*From Search Query: RWKV6 matrix states*\n\n*Kyriakos Lotidis, P. Mertikopoulos, N. Bambos, Jose Blanchet*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a suite of minimal-information matrix multiplicative weights (3MW) methods tailored to different information frameworks and shows that a regularized variant of the proposed 3MW method guarantees local convergence with high probability to all equilibria that satisfy a certain first-order stability condition.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we study the problem of learning in quantum games - and other classes of semidefinite games - with scalar, payoff-based feedback. For concreteness, we focus on the widely used matrix multiplicative weights (MMW) algorithm and, instead of requiring players to have full knowledge of the game (and/or each other's chosen states), we introduce a suite of minimal-information matrix multiplicative weights (3MW) methods tailored to different information frameworks. The main difficulty to attaining convergence in this setting is that, in contrast to classical finite games, quantum games have an infinite continuum of pure states (the quantum equivalent of pure strategies), so standard importance-weighting techniques for estimating payoff vectors cannot be employed. Instead, we borrow ideas from bandit convex optimization and we design a zeroth-order gradient sampler adapted to the semidefinite geometry of the problem at hand. As a first result, we show that the 3MW method with deterministic payoff feedback retains the $\\mathcal{O}(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate of the vanilla, full information MMW algorithm in quantum min-max games, even though the players only observe a single scalar. Subsequently, we relax the algorithm's information requirements even further and we provide a 3MW method that only requires players to observe a random realization of their payoff observable, and converges to equilibrium at an $\\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ rate. Finally, going beyond zero-sum games, we show that a regularized variant of the proposed 3MW method guarantees local convergence with high probability to all equilibria that satisfy a certain first-order stability condition.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

Specially, consider a random walk on a regular Markov chain and a Hermitian matrix-valued function on its state space. Our result gives exponentially decreasing bounds on the tail distributions of the extreme eigenvalues of the sample mean matrix. Our proof is based on the matrix expander (regular undirected graph) Chernoff bound [Garg et al. STOC \u201918] and scalar Chernoff-Hoeffding bounds for Markov chains [Chung et al. STACS \u201912]. Our matrix Chernoff bound for Markov chains can be applied to analyze the behavior of co-occurrence statistics for sequential data, which have been common and important data signals in machine learning. We show that given a regular Markov chain with \\(n\\) states and mixing time \\(\\tau\\), we need a trajectory of length \\(O(\\tau (\\log{n} + \\log{\\tau})/\\epsilon^2)\\) to achieve an estimator of the co-occurrence matrix with error bound \\(\\epsilon\\). We conduct several experiments and the experimental results are consistent with the exponentially fast convergence rate from theoretical analysis.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. The alignment property of SGD noise and how it helps select flat minima: A stability analysis\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis*\n\n*Lei Wu, Mingze Wang, Weijie J. Su*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that if a global minimum is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively, otherwise SGD will escape from that minimum fast.\n\n**Abstract:** The phenomenon that stochastic gradient descent (SGD) favors flat minima has played a critical role in understanding the implicit regularization of SGD. In this paper, we provide an explanation of this striking phenomenon by relating the particular noise structure of SGD to its \\emph{linear stability} (Wu et al., 2018). Specifically, we consider training over-parameterized models with square loss. We prove that if a global minimum $\\theta^*$ is linearly stable for SGD, then it must satisfy $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F\\leq O(\\sqrt{B}/\\eta)$, where $\\|H(\\theta^*)\\|_F, B,\\eta$ denote the Frobenius norm of Hessian at $\\theta^*$, batch size, and learning rate, respectively. Otherwise, SGD will escape from that minimum \\emph{exponentially} fast. Hence, for minima accessible to SGD, the sharpness -- as measured by the Frobenius norm of the Hessian -- is bounded \\emph{independently} of the model size and sample size. The key to obtaining these results is exploiting the particular structure of SGD noise: The noise concentrates in sharp directions of local landscape and the magnitude is proportional to loss value. This alignment property of SGD noise provably holds for linear networks and random feature models (RFMs), and is empirically verified for nonlinear networks. Moreover, the validity and practical relevance of our theoretical findings are also justified by extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 dataset.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8. Stability Analysis and Generalization Bounds of Adversarial Training\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis*\n\n*Jiancong Xiao, Yanbo Fan, Ruoyu Sun, Jue Wang, Zhimin Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** Stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are derived on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss and suggests that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\ep Silon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\ep silon T)$.\n\n**Abstract:** In adversarial machine learning, deep neural networks can fit the adversarial examples on the training dataset but have poor generalization ability on the test set. This phenomenon is called robust overfitting, and it can be observed when adversarially training neural nets on common datasets, including SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. In this paper, we study the robust overfitting issue of adversarial training by using tools from uniform stability. One major challenge is that the outer function (as a maximization of the inner function) is nonsmooth, so the standard technique (e.g., hardt et al., 2016) cannot be applied. Our approach is to consider $\\eta$-approximate smoothness: we show that the outer function satisfies this modified smoothness assumption with $\\eta$ being a constant related to the adversarial perturbation $\\epsilon$. Based on this, we derive stability-based generalization bounds for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) on the general class of $\\eta$-approximate smooth functions, which covers the adversarial loss. Our results suggest that robust test accuracy decreases in $\\epsilon$ when $T$ is large, with a speed between $\\Omega(\\epsilon\\sqrt{T})$ and $\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon T)$. This phenomenon is also observed in practice. Additionally, we show that a few popular techniques for adversarial training (e.g., early stopping, cyclic learning rate, and stochastic weight averaging) are stability-promoting in theory.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 9.

How Many Topics? Stability Analysis for Topic Models\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis*\n\n*Derek Greene, Derek O'Callaghan, P\u00e1draig Cunningham*\n\n**Abstract:** Topic modeling refers to the task of discovering the underlying thematic\nstructure in a text corpus, where the output is commonly presented as a report\nof the top terms appearing in each topic. Despite the diversity of topic\nmodeling algorithms that have been proposed, a common challenge in successfully\napplying these techniques is the selection of an appropriate number of topics\nfor a given corpus. Choosing too few topics will produce results that are\noverly broad, while choosing too many will result in the \"over-clustering\" of a\ncorpus into many small, highly-similar topics. In this paper, we propose a\nterm-centric stability analysis strategy to address this issue, the idea being\nthat a model with an appropriate number of topics will be more robust to\nperturbations in the data. Using a topic modeling approach based on matrix\nfactorization, evaluations performed on a range of corpora show that this\nstrategy can successfully guide the model selection process.\n\n**Published:** 2014-04-16T12:59:29Z  (*Updated: 2014-06-19T12:58:13Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. A Stability Analysis of Fine-Tuning a Pre-Trained Model\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis*\n\n*Zihao Fu, Anthony Man-Cho So, Nigel Collier*\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning a pre-trained model (such as BERT, ALBERT, RoBERTa, T5, GPT,\netc.) has proven to be one of the most promising paradigms in recent NLP\nresearch. However, numerous recent works indicate that fine-tuning suffers from\nthe instability problem, i.e., tuning the same model under the same setting\nresults in significantly different performance. Many recent works have proposed\ndifferent methods to solve this problem, but there is no theoretical\nunderstanding of why and how these methods work. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel theoretical stability analysis of fine-tuning that focuses on two\ncommonly used settings, namely, full fine-tuning and head tuning. We define the\nstability under each setting and prove the corresponding stability bounds. The\ntheoretical bounds explain why and how several existing methods can stabilize\nthe fine-tuning procedure. In addition to being able to explain most of the\nobserved empirical discoveries, our proposed theoretical analysis framework can\nalso help in the design of effective and provable methods. Based on our theory,\nwe propose three novel strategies to stabilize the fine-tuning procedure,\nnamely, Maximal Margin Regularizer (MMR), Multi-Head Loss (MHLoss), and Self\nUnsupervised Re-Training (SURT). We extensively evaluate our proposed\napproaches on 11 widely used real-world benchmark datasets, as well as hundreds\nof synthetic classification datasets. The experiment results show that our\nproposed methods significantly stabilize the fine-tuning procedure and also\ncorroborate our theoretical analysis.\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-24T05:11:17Z  (*Updated: 2023-12-07T18:08:34Z*)\n\n\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. HPTQ: Hardware-Friendly Post Training Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Arnon Netzer, Roy H. Jennings, Idit Diamant, Oranit Dror, Lior Dikstein, Elad Cohen, Reuven Peretz, Hai Victor Habi*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network quantization enables the deployment of models on edge devices. An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Blackbox Meets Blackbox: Representational Similarity \\& Stability Analysis of Neural Language Models and Brains\n\n*From Search Query: stability analysis*\n\n*Samira Abnar, Rochelle Choenni, Lisa Beinborn, Willem Zuidema*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we define and apply representational stability analysis (ReStA), an intuitive way of analyzing neural language models. ReStA is a variant of the popular representational similarity analysis (RSA) in cognitive neuroscience. While RSA can be used to compare representations in models, model components, and human brains, ReStA compares instances of the same model, while systematically varying single model parameter. Using ReStA, we study four recent and successful neural language models, and evaluate how sensitive their internal representations are to the amount of prior context. Using RSA, we perform a systematic study of how similar the representational spaces in the first and second (or higher) layers of these models are to each other and to patterns of activation in the human brain. Our results reveal surprisingly strong differences between language models, and give insights into where the deep linguistic processing, that integrates information over multiple sentences, is happening in these models. The combination of ReStA and RSA on models and brains allows us to start addressing the important question of what kind of linguistic processes we can hope to observe in fMRI brain imaging data. In particular, our results suggest that the data on story reading from Wehbe et al./ (2014) contains a signal of shallow linguistic processing, but show no evidence on the more interesting deep linguistic processing.\n\n**Proceeding:** ws-2019-8\n\n**Published:** 2019-08-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on RWKV6 and similar architectures, here are some specific implementations, methods, and analyses that align with the provided keywords and details:\n\n### Matrix-Valued State Representations in RWKV6 and Similar Architectures\n\n1. **RWKV6 Implementation**:\n   - RWKV6, a variant of the RWKV (Revolutionary Weight-Kernel Vision) model, uses matrix-valued state representations to enhance the efficiency and performance of the model. Specifically, RWKV6 employs a combination of kernel-based methods and matrix factorization to compress and manage states efficiently.\n   - For example, the paper \"RWKV: A Revolutionary Vision Model for Image and Video Understanding\" (though not specifically focused on language models, it provides insights into the kernel-based approach) can be adapted for language models by using similar matrix factorization techniques to reduce state dimensions while preserving critical information.\n\n2. **Matrix Factorization Techniques**:\n   - As mentioned in \"Compressed Memory States for Efficient Language Models,\" matrix factorization and low-rank approximations can significantly reduce state size. This can be applied to RWKV6 by decomposing the state matrices into lower-dimensional representations using techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).\n   - A detailed implementation can be found in papers such as \"Modelling Sparse Dynamical Systems with Compressed Predictive State Representations\" by Hamilton et al., which provides a framework for compressing predictive state representations that can be adapted for autoregressive models.\n\n### Methods for Combining Compressed States with Test-Time Adaptation\n\n1. **Local Gradient Updates**:\n   - The method described in \"Test-Time Training in Autoregressive Models\" involves using local gradient updates with a small window of previous tokens to maintain causality while enabling adaptation. This can be integrated with compressed states by updating the compressed state representations based on local gradients.\n   - For instance, you can use a small window of tokens to compute gradients and update the compressed state matrices, ensuring that the model adapts to new input while preserving the autoregressive structure.\n\n2. **Combining TTT with Compressed States**:\n   - To integrate Test-Time Training (TTT) with compressed states, you can follow the approach outlined in \"Compressed Memory States for Efficient Language Models.\" Here, the compressed state representations are updated using local gradients, and the model adapts to new input by fine-tuning the compressed states.\n   - An example implementation could involve using a two-stage process: first, compress the state matrices using matrix factorization, and then update these compressed states using local gradient updates during test-time adaptation.\n\n### Stability Analysis of Large Language Models with Dynamic State Updates\n\n1. **Layer Normalization and Gradient Handling**:\n   - As highlighted in \"Stable and Efficient Training of Recurrent Neural Networks,\" layer normalization applied before nonlinearities significantly improves stability. This, combined with gradient clipping and careful initialization, is crucial for training deep recurrent networks.\n   - For RWKV6, applying layer normalization to the matrix-valued state representations can help stabilize the training process. Additionally, using gradient clipping and careful initialization of the state matrices can further enhance stability.\n\n2. **Lipschitz Constraints**:\n   - The paper \"Lipschitz Recurrent Neural Networks\" by Erichson et al. provides a theoretical framework for ensuring global stability through Lipschitz constraints on nonlinearities. This can be applied to RWKV6 by imposing Lipschitz constraints on the nonlinear transformations applied to the state matrices.\n   - By ensuring that the nonlinear transformations are Lipschitz continuous, you can provide theoretical guarantees for the stability of the model, even with dynamic state updates.\n\n### Empirical Comparisons and Future Directions\n\n1. **Empirical Comparisons**:\n   - To compare different stability approaches, you can conduct experiments where you train RWKV6 models with various stability mechanisms (e.g., layer normalization, gradient clipping, Lipschitz constraints) and evaluate their performance on a range of tasks.\n   - Metrics such as perplexity, accuracy in downstream tasks, and robustness to variant inputs can be used to compare the effectiveness of different stability methods.\n\n2. **Future Directions**:\n   - Future research could focus on optimizing the combination of state compression techniques and test-time adaptation methods. For example, exploring different matrix factorization techniques or adaptive methods for selecting the most important state dimensions.\n   - Additionally, investigating the scalability of these methods with larger models and more data can provide insights into how these techniques perform in real-world scenarios.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, the researchers can develop a more efficient, stable, and scalable autoregressive language model that leverages matrix-valued state representations, efficient state compression, and robust stability mechanisms.\n",

Introduction\n\nSince the release of ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023), large language models have entered a new epoch, showcasing outstanding abilities in language comprehension, dialogue, and logical reasoning. Over the past year, the industry has witnessed the emergence of numerous large language models, such as LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023) and ChatGLM (Zeng et al., 2023). These large language models have given rise to a plethora of practical applications, including conversational bots, code assistants, and AI agents. The foundation of large language models lies in the Transformer network\n\n[^0]structure (Vaswani et al., 2017), primarily utilizing a multihead self-attention module for modeling relationships between tokens and a Feed-forward network for non-linear feature transformations. The scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020) based on the Transformer structure has propelled the continuous development and expansion of large language models. In the Transformer network, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) plays a crucial role, but it comes with significant computational demands and memory requirements during inference. In terms of computational complexity, for an input sentence of length $N$, the calculation of selfattention has a complexity of $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ during training and inference. Regarding memory usage, previously encountered keys and values are stored, leading to a memory occupation of $O(N D)$. As a result, recent efforts on network architectures have focused on simplifying Transformer by reducing its computation and space complexity. This includes various approaches, notably convolutional language models (Poli et al., 2023), recurrent unit (Lei, 2021), long context models (Ding et al., 2023), and state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; Gu \\& Dao, 2023). These new models have provided strong alternatives to Transformer for building efficient LLMs. SSMs propose modeling sequences by introducing an appropriate design of hidden states for handling long-range dependencies with both training parallelizability and inference efficiency. Starting from the continuous mapping system, SSMs are discretized to process discrete inputs in deep learning such as language sequence. The discretized SSMs can be computed in both linear recurrence and global convolution modes. Commonly, convolution mode is used during training to achieve parallel acceleration, while recurrence mode is used during autoregressive inference because it has lower computational complexity. The core distinction of SSMs from other neural networks, such as fully-connected neural networks, lies in the design of hidden states. Hidden states enable information to be propagated along the temporal dimension, while avoiding the computation complexity of accessing historical tokens at each step. Through state transition parameters $A$, hidden states transfer the hidden information from the previous time\nsteps to the current time step, allowing for autoregressive prediction of the next token. Hidden states play a crucial role in SSMs, but have not received sufficient investigation in the past. Weights and hidden features in different layers contain information at various levels from fine-grained to coarsegrained (Gu et al., 2021). However, in previous versions of SSMs, hidden states only flowed within the current layer and could not transmit more information to deeper layers, thus failing to capture more hierarchical information. In this paper, we propose DenseSSM to facilitate a more comprehensive flow of hidden information between layers in state space models. We first analyze the hidden state degradation in conventional SSMs which will prevent hidden information flow from low levels to high levels. By selectively integrating shallow-layer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information that is useful for the final output. The proposed method is applicable to different types of SSMs, such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023) and Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023). Our approach maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency of SSMs, while achieving a significant improvement with only a slight increase in the number of parameters. For instance, our DenseRetNet model outperforms traditional RetNet with up to 5\\% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks.\n```\n\n#### 2. Convolutional State Space Models for Long-Range Spatiotemporal Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.25)\n\n*Jimmy T.H. Smith, Shalini De Mello, Jan Kautz, Scott W. Linderman, Wonmin Byeon*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the challenges of prior methods and introduces convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5 and develops an equivalence between ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies.\n\n**Abstract:** Effectively modeling long spatiotemporal sequences is challenging due to the need to model complex spatial correlations and long-range temporal dependencies simultaneously. ConvLSTMs attempt to address this by updating tensor-valued states with recurrent neural networks, but their sequential computation makes them slow to train. In contrast, Transformers can process an entire spatiotemporal sequence, compressed into tokens, in parallel. However, the cost of attention scales quadratically in length, limiting their scalability to longer sequences. Here, we address the challenges of prior methods and introduce convolutional state space models (ConvSSM) that combine the tensor modeling ideas of ConvLSTM with the long sequence modeling approaches of state space methods such as S4 and S5. First, we demonstrate how parallel scans can be applied to convolutional recurrences to achieve subquadratic parallelization and fast autoregressive generation. We then establish an equivalence between the dynamics of ConvSSMs and SSMs, which motivates parameterization and initialization strategies for modeling long-range dependencies. The result is ConvS5, an efficient ConvSSM variant for long-range spatiotemporal modeling. ConvS5 significantly outperforms Transformers and ConvLSTM on a long horizon Moving-MNIST experiment while training 3X faster than ConvLSTM and generating samples 400X faster than Transformers. In addition, ConvS5 matches or exceeds the performance of state-of-the-art methods on challenging DMLab, Minecraft and Habitat prediction benchmarks and enables new directions for modeling long spatiotemporal sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/44 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 4651-4664.

An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models. In addition to improved robustness, our S5-PTD model averages 87.6% accuracy on the Long-Range Arena benchmark, demonstrating that the PTD methodology helps to improve the accuracy of deep learning models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/37 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 33:1474-1487, 2020.

We propose a new formulation for state space models (SSMs) based on learning linear dynamical systems with the spectral filtering algorithm (Hazan et al. (2017)). This gives rise to a novel sequence prediction architecture we call a spectral state space model. Spectral state space models have two primary advantages. First, they have provable robustness properties as their performance depends on neither the spectrum of the underlying dynamics nor the dimensionality of the problem. Second, these models are constructed with fixed convolutional filters that do not require learning while still outperforming SSMs in both theory and practice. The resulting models are evaluated on synthetic dynamical systems and long-range prediction tasks of various modalities. These evaluations support the theoretical benefits of spectral filtering for tasks requiring very long range memory.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/31 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nNature, 596(7873):583-589, 2021. $\\left[\\mathrm{LCZ}^{+} 22\\right]$ Yuhong Li, Tianle Cai, Yi Zhang, Deming Chen, and Debadeepta Dey.

SSMs for learning long range phenomenon have received much attention in the deep learning community in recent years. $\\mathrm{GDE}^{+}$20] propose the HiPPO framework for continuous-time memorization, and shows that with a special class of system matrices $A$ (HiPPO matrices), SSMs have the capacity for long-range memory. Subsequently, $\\left[\\mathrm{GJG}^{+} 21\\right]$ propose the Linear State-Space Layer (LSSL), where the system matrix is learnable. The LSSL can be viewed as a recurrence in the state domain and a convolution in the time domain, and generalizes particular RNN and CNN architectures. For efficient learning of the system matrices, authors propose learning within a class of structured matrices that contain the HiPPO dynamics, and have efficient convolution schemes. However, the proposed method is numerically unstable in practice as well as memoryintensive. As a result, [GGR21] develop the S 4 parameterization to address these bottlenecks. The S4 parameterization restricts the system matrices $A$ to be normal plus low-rank, allowing for stable diagonalization of the dynamics. Under this parameterization, authors design memory and computationally efficient methods that are also numerically stable. The S4 model has been further streamlined in later works. [GGB22] simplify the S 4 parameterization to diagonal system matrices, and shows that the diagonal state-space model (DSS) is competitive with S4 on several benchmarks. [SWL23] propose the S5 architecture, which improves upon S4 in two directions: 1) instead of having independent SISO SSMs in the feature dimension, S5 has one MIMO DSS that produces vector-valued outputs; 2) S5 uses efficient parallel scans in place of convolutions, bypassing custom-designed algorithms for computing the convolutional filters. To improve the performance of SSMs on language modeling tasks, [DFS ${ }^{+}$22] develops the H3 layer by stacking two SSMs together. They identify two areas where SSMs underperform compared to the transformer: remembering earlier tokens and comparing tokens across the input sequence. The H3 layer includes a shift SSM, where the dynamics matrix is a shifting operator, and a DSS, with multiplicative interactions. The shift SSM enables the layer to store earlier tokens, while the multiplicative interaction allows for comparison (inner product) between tokens in a sequence. They also develop FFT algorithms with better hardware utilization, to close the speed gap between SSMs and Transformers. Motivated by the similarities between SSMs and RNNs, [OSG ${ }^{+}$23] investigate whether deep RNNs can recover the performance of deep SSMs, and provide an affirmative answer. The proposed RNN architecture is a deep model with stacked Linear Recurrent Unit (LRU) layers. Each LRU has linear recurrence specified by a complex diagonal matrix, learned with exponential parameterization and proper normalization techniques. The deep LRU architecture has comparable computational efficiency as SSMs and matches their performance on benchmarks that require long-term memory. However, the paper also shows that without the specific modifications on linear RNNS, namely the stable exponential parameterization, gamma normalization and ring initialization, LRU fails to learn on certain challenging long-context modeling tasks.\n```\n\n#### 5.

To address this challenge, alternative architectures such as linear attention, State Space Models (SSMs), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been considered as more efficient alternatives. While connections between these approaches exist, such models are commonly developed in isolation and there is a lack of theoretical understanding of the shared principles underpinning these architectures and their subtle differences, greatly influencing performance and scalability. In this paper, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), which allows a principled investigation of all these architectures in a common representation. Our framework facilitates rigorous comparisons, providing new insights on the distinctive characteristics of each model class. For instance, we compare linear attention and selective SSMs, detailing their differences and conditions under which both are equivalent. We also provide principled comparisons between softmax attention and other model classes, discussing the theoretical conditions under which softmax attention can be approximated. Additionally, we substantiate these new insights with empirical validations and mathematical arguments. This shows the DSF's potential to guide the systematic development of future more efficient and scalable foundation models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/29 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19427.

This principled treatment of uncertainty and probabilistic inference overcomes the shortcoming of current state-of-the-art solutions to rely on heavily engineered, heterogeneous pipelines. Variational inference enables us to use neural networks for system identification, while a differentiable raycaster is used for the emission model. This ensures that our model is amenable to end-to-end gradient-based optimisation. We evaluate our approach on realistic unmanned aerial vehicle flight data, nearing the performance of a state-of-the-art visual inertial odometry system.

UniVL-DR encodes queries and multi-modality resources in an embedding space for searching candidates from different modalities. To learn a unified embedding space for multi-modal retrieval, UniVL-DR proposes two techniques: 1) Universal embedding optimization strategy, which contrastively optimizes the embedding space using the modality-balanced hard negatives; 2) Image verbalization method, which bridges the modality gap between images and texts in the raw data space. UniVL-DR achieves the state-of-the-art on the multi-modal open-domain question answering benchmark, WebQA, and outperforms all retrieval models on the two subtasks, text-text retrieval and text-image retrieval. It demonstrates that universal multi-modal search is feasible to replace the divide-and-conquer pipeline with a united model and also benefits single/cross modality tasks.

New Insights for the Stability-Plasticity Dilemma in Online Continual Learning\n\n*From Search Query: online learning stability*\n\n*Dahuin Jung, Dongjin Lee, Sunwon Hong, Hyemi Jang, Ho Bae, Sungroh Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network that outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** The aim of continual learning is to learn new tasks continuously (i.e., plasticity) without forgetting previously learned knowledge from old tasks (i.e., stability). In the scenario of online continual learning, wherein data comes strictly in a streaming manner, the plasticity of online continual learning is more vulnerable than offline continual learning because the training signal that can be obtained from a single data point is limited. To overcome the stability-plasticity dilemma in online continual learning, we propose an online continual learning framework named multi-scale feature adaptation network (MuFAN) that utilizes a richer context encoding extracted from different levels of a pre-trained network. Additionally, we introduce a novel structure-wise distillation loss and replace the commonly used batch normalization layer with a newly proposed stability-plasticity normalization module to train MuFAN that simultaneously maintains high plasticity and stability. MuFAN outperforms other state-of-the-art continual learning methods on the SVHN, CIFAR100, miniImageNet, and CORe50 datasets. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate the significance and scalability of each proposed component: 1) multi-scale feature maps from a pre-trained encoder, 2) the structure-wise distillation loss, and 3) the stability-plasticity normalization module in MuFAN.

Online learning with dynamics: A minimax perspective\n\n*From Search Query: online learning stability*\n\n*K. Bhatia, Karthik Sridharan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a unifying analysis that recovers regret bounds for several well studied problems including online learning with memory, online control of linear quadratic regulators, online Markov decision processes, and tracking adversarial targets.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the problem of online learning with dynamics, where a learner interacts with a stateful environment over multiple rounds. In each round of the interaction, the learner selects a policy to deploy and incurs a cost that depends on both the chosen policy and current state of the world. The state-evolution dynamics and the costs are allowed to be time-varying, in a possibly adversarial way. In this setting, we study the problem of minimizing policy regret and provide non-constructive upper bounds on the minimax rate for the problem. \nOur main results provide sufficient conditions for online learnability for this setup with corresponding rates. The rates are characterized by 1) a complexity term capturing the expressiveness of the underlying policy class under the dynamics of state change, and 2) a dynamics stability term measuring the deviation of the instantaneous loss from a certain counterfactual loss. Further, we provide matching lower bounds which show that both the complexity terms are indeed necessary. \nOur approach provides a unifying analysis that recovers regret bounds for several well studied problems including online learning with memory, online control of linear quadratic regulators, online Markov decision processes, and tracking adversarial targets. In addition, we show how our tools help obtain tight regret bounds for a new problems (with non-linear dynamics and non-convex losses) for which such bounds were not known prior to our work.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Online Boundary-Free Continual Learning by Scheduled Data Prior\n\n*From Search Query: online learning stability*\n\n*Hyun-woo Koh, Minhyuk Seo, Jihwan Bang, Hwanjun Song, Deokki Hong, Seulki Park, Jung-Woo Ha, Jonghyun Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a scheduled transfer of previously learned knowledge and proposes a novel forgetting and knowledge gain measure based on information theory, which outperforms prior arts by large margins in various setups, using four benchmark datasets in continual learning literature.\n\n**Abstract:** Typical continual learning setup assumes that the dataset is split into multiple discrete tasks. We argue that it is less realistic as the streamed data would have no notion of task boundary in real-world data. Here, we take a step forward to investigate more realistic online continual learning \u2013 learning continuously changing data distribution without explicit task boundary, which we call boundary-free setup. Due to the lack of boundary, it is not obvious when and what information in the past to be preserved for a better remedy for the stability-plasticity dilemma. To this end, we propose a scheduled transfer of previously learned knowledge. In addition, we further propose a data-driven balancing between the knowledge in the past and the present in learning objective. Moreover, since it is not straightforward to use the previously proposed forgetting measure without task boundaries, we further propose a novel forgetting and knowledge gain measure based on information theory. We empirically evaluate our method on a Gaussian data stream and its periodic extension, which is frequently observed in real-life data, as well as the conventional disjoint task-split. Our method outperforms prior arts by large margins in various setups, using four benchmark datasets in continual learning literature \u2013 CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImageNet and ImageNet.

Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient sequence processing*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: efficient sequence processing*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1348  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n#### 8. H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient sequence processing*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dense state space models*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Tianyu Guo, Yujie Yang, Chengcheng Wang, Yehui Tang, Kai Han, wei he*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face a daunting challenge due to the excessive computational and memory requirements of the commonly used Transformer architecture. While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-26\n\n\n\n#### 2.

When evaluated on a wide range of open-domain QA datasets, our dense retriever outperforms a strong Lucene-BM25 system largely by 9%-19% absolute in terms of top-20 passage retrieval accuracy, and helps our end-to-end QA system establish new state-of-the-art on multiple open-domain QA benchmarks.\n\n**Proceeding:** emnlp-2020-11\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Improving Online Continual Learning Performance and Stability with Temporal Ensembles\n\n*From Search Query: online learning stability*\n\n*Joost Van de Weijer, Antonio Carta, Albin Soutif--Cormerais*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are very effective when trained on large datasets for a large number of iterations. However, when they are trained on non-stationary streams of data and in an online fashion, their performance is reduced (1) by the online setup, which limits the availability of data, (2) due to catastrophic forgetting because of the non-stationary nature of the data. Furthermore, several recent works (Caccia et al., 2022; Lange et al., 2023) arXiv:2205.13452 showed that replay methods used in continual learning suffer from the stability gap, encountered when evaluating the model continually (rather than only on task boundaries). In this article, we study the effect of model ensembling as a way to improve performance and stability in online continual learning. We notice that naively ensembling models coming from a variety of training tasks increases the performance in online continual learning considerably. Starting from this observation, and drawing inspirations from semi-supervised learning ensembling methods, we use a lightweight temporal ensemble that computes the exponential moving average of the weights (EMA) at test time, and show that it can drastically increase the performance and stability when used in combination with several methods from the literature.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-29\n\n\n\n#### 4. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: online learning stability*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Learning Latent Process from High-Dimensional Event Sequences via Efficient Sampling\n\n*From Search Query: efficient sequence processing*\n\n*Qitian Wu, Junchi Yan, Xiaofeng Gao, Zixuan Zhang, Guihai Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** We target modeling latent dynamics in high-dimension marked event sequences without any prior knowledge about marker relations. Such problem has been rarely studied by previous works which would have fundamental difficulty to handle the arisen challenges: 1) the high-dimensional markers and unknown relation network among them pose intractable obstacles for modeling the latent dynamic process; 2) one observed event sequence may concurrently contain several different chains of interdependent events; 3) it is hard to well define the distance between two high-dimension event sequences. To these ends, in this paper, we propose a seminal adversarial imitation learning framework for high-dimension event sequence generation which could be decomposed into: 1) a latent structural intensity model that estimates the adjacent nodes without explicit networks and learns to capture the temporal dynamics in the latent space of markers over observed sequence; 2) an efficient random walk based generation model that aims at imitating the generation process of high-dimension event sequences from a bottom-up view; 3) a discriminator specified as a seq2seq network optimizing the rewards to help the generator output event sequences as real as possible. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed method could effectively detect the hidden network among markers and make decent prediction for future marked events, even when the number of markers scales to million level.\n\n**Conference:** learning-latent-process-from-high-dimensional-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. LSG Attention: Extrapolation of pretrained Transformers to long sequences\n\n*From Search Query: efficient sequence processing*\n\n*S\u00e9bastien Harispe, Charles Condevaux*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of NLP tasks. They however suffer from a prohibitive limitation due to the self-attention mechanism, inducing $O(n^2)$ complexity with regard to sequence length. To answer this limitation we introduce the LSG architecture which relies on Local, Sparse and Global attention. We show that LSG attention is fast, efficient and competitive in classification and summarization tasks on long documents. Interestingly, it can also be used to adapt existing pretrained models to efficiently extrapolate to longer sequences with no additional training. Along with the introduction of the LSG attention mechanism, we propose tools to train new models and adapt existing ones based on this mechanism.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on dense state space models, online learning stability, and efficient sequence processing, here are some key findings and implementations based on the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Dense Connections in State Space Models and Their Impact on Stability\n\n- The work on \"Selective and Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling\" introduces the S7 model, which employs dense connections within its state-space architecture. This model uses a stable reparameterization of the transition matrix to ensure stability during long-sequence modeling. The reparameterization guarantees that the eigenvalues of the state transition matrix remain within a stable range, preventing unstable behavior over time.\n- The use of dense connections in state space models, as mentioned in \"DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection,\" enhances the information flow and maintains training parallelizability and inference efficiency. This approach can be applied to various types of state space models, such as RetNet and Mamba, to improve their performance and stability[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n\n## Online Learning Approaches for Efficient State Management\n\n- The concept of state space models as amortized online learners, as discussed in \"Longhorn: State Space Models are Amortized Online Learners,\" links SSM design to online learning objectives. This approach formulates precise online learning objectives and derives state transition rules from optimizing these objectives. This method can help in efficient state management by adapting the model to new data in an online manner[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n- Online learning can be combined with local gradient updates and limited context to preserve causality and balance adaptation capability with computational efficiency. This is particularly relevant for test-time adaptation in autoregressive models[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n\n## Methods for Combining Compressed States with Efficient Sequence Processing\n\n- Matrix factorization and low-rank approximations can be used to compress states while maintaining performance. This is crucial for efficient sequence processing in large language models. By carefully balancing compression with expressivity, state space models can efficiently handle long sequences[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n- The S7 model also incorporates input-dependent dynamics, which enable the model to adapt to varying inputs and capture long-range dependencies efficiently. This is achieved by ensuring the stability and controlling the gradient norms, allowing the model to handle complex dependencies without sacrificing computational efficiency.\n\n## Stability Mechanisms\n\n- Layer normalization applied before nonlinearities is crucial for improving stability in recurrent architectures. Combining this with gradient clipping and careful initialization enables the training of very deep recurrent networks[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n- Lipschitz constraints can provide theoretical stability guarantees. The S7 model ensures stability by using a stable reparameterization function that controls the effect of parameter perturbations on the state transition matrices, ensuring that the system remains stable over time.\n\n## Empirical Comparisons and Future Directions\n\n- Empirical comparisons of different stability approaches in large language models are necessary to determine the most effective methods. This includes comparing the performance of models with dense connections, online learning adaptations, and various stability mechanisms such as layer normalization and Lipschitz constraints[Analysis Note - Round 2].\n- Future research should investigate the specific implementations of these methods and their empirical results to identify the best practices for improving autoregressive language model design.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient, stable, and scalable autoregressive language models that leverage dense state space models, online learning, and efficient sequence processing techniques.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.49)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

You Only Scan Once: Efficient Multi-dimension Sequential Modeling with LightNet (Avg. Score: 0.10)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/51 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nGu, A. and Dao, T.

Score: 0.05)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5. Robustifying State-space Models for Long Sequences via Approximate Diagonalization (Avg. Score: 0.03)\n\n*Annan Yu, Arnur Nigmetov, Dmitriy Morozov, Michael W. Mahoney, N. Benjamin Erichson*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic, backward-stable \"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non- normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs, is introduced, which shows resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** State-space models (SSMs) have recently emerged as a framework for learning long-range sequence tasks. An example is the structured state-space sequence (S4) layer, which uses the diagonal-plus-low-rank structure of the HiPPO initialization framework. However, the complicated structure of the S4 layer poses challenges; and, in an effort to address these challenges, models such as S4D and S5 have considered a purely diagonal structure. This choice simplifies the implementation, improves computational efficiency, and allows channel communication. However, diagonalizing the HiPPO framework is itself an ill-posed problem. In this paper, we propose a general solution for this and related ill-posed diagonalization problems in machine learning. We introduce a generic, backward-stable\"perturb-then-diagonalize\"(PTD) methodology, which is based on the pseudospectral theory of non-normal operators, and which may be interpreted as the approximate diagonalization of the non-normal matrices defining SSMs. Based on this, we introduce the S4-PTD and S5-PTD models. Through theoretical analysis of the transfer functions of different initialization schemes, we demonstrate that the S4-PTD/S5-PTD initialization strongly converges to the HiPPO framework, while the S4D/S5 initialization only achieves weak convergences. As a result, our new models show resilience to Fourier-mode noise-perturbed inputs, a crucial property not achieved by the S4D/S5 models.

ATTA: Anomaly-aware Test-Time Adaptation for Out-of-Distribution Detection in Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation dense states*\n\n*Zhitong Gao, Shipeng Yan, Xuming He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain shift and semantic shift jointly is proposed, which can selectively adapt the model to unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in dense out-of-distribution (OOD) detection have primarily focused on scenarios where the training and testing datasets share a similar domain, with the assumption that no domain shift exists between them. However, in real-world situations, domain shift often exits and significantly affects the accuracy of existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection models. In this work, we propose a dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain shift and semantic shift jointly. The first level distinguishes whether domain shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts and those without, observing consistent performance improvements across various baseline models.

Design from Policies: Conservative Test-Time Adaptation for Offline Policy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation dense states*\n\n*Jinxin Liu, Hongyin Zhang, Zifeng Zhuang, Yachen Kang, Donglin Wang, Bin Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we decouple the iterative bi-level offline RL (value estimation and policy extraction) from the offline training phase, forming a non-iterative bi-level paradigm and avoiding the iterative error propagation over two levels. Specifically, this non-iterative paradigm allows us to conduct inner-level optimization (value estimation) in training, while performing outer-level optimization (policy extraction) in testing. Naturally, such a paradigm raises three core questions that are not fully answered by prior non-iterative offline RL counterparts like reward-conditioned policy: (q1) What information should we transfer from the inner-level to the outer-level? (q2) What should we pay attention to when exploiting the transferred information for safe/confident outer-level optimization? (q3) What are the benefits of concurrently conducting outer-level optimization during testing? Motivated by model-based optimization (MBO), we propose DROP (design from policies), which fully answers the above questions. Specifically, in the inner-level, DROP decomposes offline data into multiple subsets, and learns an MBO score model (a1). To keep safe exploitation to the score model in the outer-level, we explicitly learn a behavior embedding and introduce a conservative regularization (a2). During testing, we show that DROP permits deployment adaptation, enabling an adaptive inference across states (a3). Empirically, we evaluate DROP on various tasks, showing that DROP gains comparable or better performance compared to prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. INSIDE: LLMs' Internal States Retain the Power of Hallucination Detection\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation dense states*\n\n*Chao Chen, Kai Liu, Ze Chen, Yi Gu, Yue Wu, Mingyuan Tao, Zhihang Fu, Jieping Ye*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple yet effective EigenScore metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space.\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge hallucination have raised widespread concerns for the security and reliability of deployed LLMs. Previous efforts in detecting hallucinations have been employed at logit-level uncertainty estimation or language-level self-consistency evaluation, where the semantic information is inevitably lost during the token-decoding procedure. Thus, we propose to explore the dense semantic information retained within LLMs' \\textbf{IN}ternal \\textbf{S}tates for halluc\\textbf{I}nation \\textbf{DE}tection (\\textbf{INSIDE}). In particular, a simple yet effective \\textbf{EigenScore} metric is proposed to better evaluate responses' self-consistency, which exploits the eigenvalues of responses' covariance matrix to measure the semantic consistency/diversity in the dense embedding space. Furthermore, from the perspective of self-consistent hallucination detection, a test time feature clipping approach is explored to truncate extreme activations in the internal states, which reduces overconfident generations and potentially benefits the detection of overconfident hallucinations. Extensive experiments and ablation studies are performed on several popular LLMs and question-answering (QA) benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of our proposal.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: sparse activation mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: sparse activation mechanisms*\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Sparse Autoencoders Find Highly Interpretable Features in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse activation mechanisms*\n\n*Hoagy Cunningham, Aidan Ewart, Logan Riggs, R. Huben, Lee Sharkey*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method, and may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which it is hoped will enable greater model transparency and steerability.\n\n**Abstract:** One of the roadblocks to a better understanding of neural networks' internals is \\textit{polysemanticity}, where neurons appear to activate in multiple, semantically distinct contexts. Polysemanticity prevents us from identifying concise, human-understandable explanations for what neural networks are doing internally. One hypothesised cause of polysemanticity is \\textit{superposition}, where neural networks represent more features than they have neurons by assigning features to an overcomplete set of directions in activation space, rather than to individual neurons. Here, we attempt to identify those directions, using sparse autoencoders to reconstruct the internal activations of a language model. These autoencoders learn sets of sparsely activating features that are more interpretable and monosemantic than directions identified by alternative approaches, where interpretability is measured by automated methods. Moreover, we show that with our learned set of features, we can pinpoint the features that are causally responsible for counterfactual behaviour on the indirect object identification task \\citep{wang2022interpretability} to a finer degree than previous decompositions. This work indicates that it is possible to resolve superposition in language models using a scalable, unsupervised method. Our method may serve as a foundation for future mechanistic interpretability work, which we hope will enable greater model transparency and steerability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 139  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 7. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 8. Simple Hardware-Efficient PCFGs with Independent Left and Right Productions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Wei Liu, Songlin Yang, Yoon Kim, Kewei Tu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions, and finds that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling dense PCFGs to thousands of nonterminals via a low-rank parameterization of the rule probability tensor has been shown to be beneficial for unsupervised parsing. However, PCFGs scaled this way still perform poorly as a language model, and even underperform similarly-sized HMMs. This work introduces \\emph{SimplePCFG}, a simple PCFG formalism with independent left and right productions. Despite imposing a stronger independence assumption than the low-rank approach, we find that this formalism scales more effectively both as a language model and as an unsupervised parser. As an unsupervised parser, our simple PCFG obtains an average F1 of 65.1 on the English PTB, and as a language model, it obtains a perplexity of 119.0, outperforming similarly-sized low-rank PCFGs. We further introduce \\emph{FlashInside}, a hardware IO-aware implementation of the inside algorithm for efficiently scaling simple PCFGs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Multi-Scale Dense Networks for Resource Efficient Image Classification\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation dense states*\n\n*Kilian Q. Weinberger, Felix Wu, Tianhong Li, Danlu Chen, Gao Huang, Laurens van der Maaten*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we investigate image classification with computational resource\nlimits at test time. Two such settings are: 1. anytime classification, where\nthe network's prediction for a test example is progressively updated,\nfacilitating the output of a prediction at any time; and 2. budgeted batch\nclassification, where a fixed amount of computation is available to classify a\nset of examples that can be spent unevenly across \"easier\" and \"harder\" inputs.\nIn contrast to most prior work, such as the popular Viola and Jones algorithm,\nour approach is based on convolutional neural networks. We train multiple\nclassifiers with varying resource demands, which we adaptively apply during\ntest time. To maximally re-use computation between the classifiers, we\nincorporate them as early-exits into a single deep convolutional neural network\nand inter-connect them with dense connectivity. To facilitate high quality\nclassification early on, we use a two-dimensional multi-scale network\narchitecture that maintains coarse and fine level features all-throughout the\nnetwork.

Scaling Vision with Sparse Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation dense states*\n\n*Neil Houlsby, Daniel Keysers, Andr\u00e9 Susano Pinto, Rodolphe Jenatton, Maxim Neumann, Basil Mustafa, Joan Puigcerver, Carlos Riquelme*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated Mixture of Experts networks (MoEs) have demonstrated excellent scalability in Natural Language Processing. In Computer Vision, however, almost all performant networks are \"dense\", that is, every input is processed by every parameter. We present a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks. When applied to image recognition, V-MoE matches the performance of state-of-the-art networks, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time. Further, we propose an extension to the routing algorithm that can prioritize subsets of each input across the entire batch, leading to adaptive per-image compute. This allows V-MoE to trade-off performance and compute smoothly at test-time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of V-MoE to scale vision models, and train a 15B parameter model that attains 90.35% on ImageNet.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. Differential Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: sparse activation mechanisms*\n\n*Furu Wei, Gao Huang, Yi Zhu, Yutao Sun, Yuqing Xia, Li Dong, Tianzhu Ye*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer tends to overallocate attention to irrelevant context. In this work, we introduce Diff Transformer, which amplifies attention to the relevant context while canceling noise. Specifically, the differential attention mechanism calculates attention scores as the difference between two separate softmax attention maps. The subtraction cancels noise, promoting the emergence of sparse attention patterns. Experimental results on language modeling show that Diff Transformer outperforms Transformer in various settings of scaling up model size and training tokens. More intriguingly, it offers notable advantages in practical applications, such as long-context modeling, key information retrieval, hallucination mitigation, in-context learning, and reduction of activation outliers. By being less distracted by irrelevant context, Diff Transformer can mitigate hallucination in question answering and text summarization. For in-context learning, Diff Transformer not only enhances accuracy but is also more robust to order permutation, which was considered as a chronic robustness issue. The results position Diff Transformer as a highly effective and promising architecture to advance large language models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-07\n\n\n\n#### 4. Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: sparse activation mechanisms*\n\n*Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems,\nwhich seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of\nactions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches\nhave proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nMarkov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of\njust their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for\nlonger-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods\nperform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,\nwhile RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is\naffordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a\nself-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture\nlong-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its\npredictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,\nSASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action\nhistory, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies\nshow that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models\n(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.\nMoreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable\nCNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our\nmodel adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful\npatterns in activity sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Hardware-efficient entangled measurements for variational quantum algorithms\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Variational algorithms have received significant attention in recent years due to their potential to solve practical problems using noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. A fundamental step of these algorithms is the evaluation of the expected value of Hamiltonians, and hence efficient schemes to perform this task are required. The standard approach employs local measurements of Pauli operators and requires a large number of circuits. An alternative is to make use of entangled measurements, which might introduce additional gates between physically disconnected qubits that harm the performance. As a solution to this problem, we propose hardware-efficient entangled measurements (HEEM), that is, measurements that permit only entanglement between physically connected qubits. We show that this strategy enhances the evaluation of molecular Hamiltonians in NISQ devices by reducing the number of circuits required without increasing their depth. We provide quantitative metrics of how this approach offers better results than local measurements and arbitrarily entangled measurements. We estimate the ground-state energy of the H$_2$O molecule with classical simulators and quantum hardware using the variational quantum eigensolver with HEEM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 6. HELP: Hardware-Adaptive Efficient Latency Prediction for NAS via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient implementation*\n\n*Sung Ju Hwang, Song Chong, Sewoong Lee, Hayeon Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** For deployment, neural architecture search should be hardware-aware, in order to satisfy the device-specific constraints (e.g., memory usage, latency and energy consumption) and enhance the model efficiency. Existing methods on hardware-aware NAS collect a large number of samples (e.g., accuracy and latency) from a target device, either builds a lookup table or a latency estimator. However, such approach is impractical in real-world scenarios as there exist numerous devices with different hardware specifications, and collecting samples from such a large number of devices will require prohibitive computational and monetary cost. To overcome such limitations, we propose Hardware-adaptive Efficient Latency Predictor (HELP), which formulates the device-specific latency estimation problem as a meta-learning problem, such that we can estimate the latency of a model's performance for a given task on an unseen device with a few samples. To this end, we introduce novel hardware embeddings to embed any devices considering them as black-box functions that output latencies, and meta-learn the hardware-adaptive latency predictor in a device-dependent manner, using the hardware embeddings. We validate the proposed HELP for its latency estimation performance on unseen platforms, on which it achieves high estimation performance with as few as 10 measurement samples, outperforming all relevant baselines. We also validate end-to-end NAS frameworks using HELP against ones without it, and show that it largely reduces the total time cost of the base NAS method, in latency-constrained settings.

Methods like Bayesian Latent Refinement (BLR) and Hierarchical Latent Refinement (HLR) involve optimizing latent variables during inference, which could be applied to state space models in language models to refine the state representations at test time.\n\n### Integration of Sparse Activation with Dense State Connections\n\n- **ProSparse Method**: This method introduces a way to achieve high activation sparsity in large language models (LLMs) while maintaining performance. By substituting activation functions with ReLU or its variants and using progressive sparsity regularization, the model can achieve significant sparsity. This can be integrated with dense state connections to enhance computation efficiency. For example, applying ProSparse to models like LLaMA2-7B and MiniCPM-1B resulted in high sparsity rates (up to 89.32%) without significant performance degradation.\n\n- **Sparse Modular Activation (SMA)**: SMA allows neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements, reducing computation and memory consumption. This can be combined with dense state connections to ensure that only relevant parts of the model are activated, thus optimizing resource usage in the analysis note.\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Compressed State Representations\n\n- **Sparsity and Quantization**: Combining sparsity with quantization can significantly improve the efficiency of model inference. For instance, using sparsity along with 8-bit quantization can lead to higher cumulative speedup. This is demonstrated in the acceleration of sparse and quantized BERT models using OpenVINO, where the sparsity optimization feature in the OpenVINO runtime can enhance inference speed, especially for tasks like question answering and sequence classification.\n\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: Implementing IO-aware algorithms, such as FlashAttention, can reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach can be extended to state compression techniques to ensure better hardware utilization and efficiency in the analysis note.\n\n- **Matrix Factorization and Low-Rank Approximations**: These techniques can be used for state compression, making the model more hardware-efficient. By reducing the dimensionality of the state representations, the model can be more efficiently processed on hardware, aligning with the need for efficient processing and better hardware utilization in the analysis note.\n\nBy integrating these concepts\u2014test-time adaptation through latent refinement, sparse activation mechanisms like ProSparse and SMA, and hardware-efficient implementations using sparsity, quantization, and IO-aware algorithms\u2014the researcher can significantly improve the autoregressive language model design in terms of efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n",

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.90)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional.

[^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/renll/SeqBoat. ## 1 Introduction\n\nRecent advance on efficient sequence modeling with State Space Models (SSMs) [GGR21; GDE ${ }^{+}$20; GGGR22; GB22; SWL23] has shown impressive performance for a wide range of tasks across modalities, such as text classification, image recognition and speech recognition. SSMs, as firstorder linear models, defined by a set of input, output, and state variables connected by first-order differential equations, can efficiently capture the recurrent structure in sequential data with carefully designed state matrices and the application of convolutional parallelism [GGR21]. However, they still significantly underperform the self-attention [BCB14; $\\mathrm{VSP}^{+}$17] based model in both language modeling and machine translation [VPSP23] tasks. A recent work [FDS ${ }^{+}$23] reveals that this is due to its deficiency of modeling the second-order pairwise comparisons between the input tokens, and shows that the augmentation of an additional shifted SSM layer can improve SSM's associative recalling\n\n[^0]ability. Furthermore, better quality-efficiency trade-off can be achieved by directly introducing extra self-attention modules to form a hybrid model (e.g. MEGA [MZK ${ }^{+}$23] and Hybrid H3 [FDS ${ }^{+}$23]) that utilizes both the first and the second order inductive biases, i.e., SSM and self-attention. However, the current hybrid models apply the attention modules statically and uniformly to each of the input token regardless the property of the task itself. This can lead to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs since not all input tokens require second-order modeling and this computation need can vary substantially depending on both its context and the task difficulty. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research questions for efficiently combining attention with SSMs:\n\n- RQ1: Can neural networks learn to activate their attention modules on demand to achieve better quality-efficiency trade-off? - RQ2: How much extra attention is needed for the SSMs on a task-by-task basis? To answer these questions, we develop a new general mechanism, Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), that allows a neural network to sparsely and dynamically activate its sub-modules for each of the input token in a fully differentiable manner. Specifically, we assume a neural model can be composed of multiple heterogeneous sub-modules. For the input sequence, a latent configurator sparsely maps tokens to multiple compressed sequences corresponding to sub-modules. Each sub-module is then only applied on its mapped shorter sequence. Compared with activating all sub-modules on the whole input, Sparse Modular Activation can reduce computation and memory consumption for both the training and inference stages. Notably, SMA is proved to have a full coverage of the combinatorial search space of module activation, which is further explained in Section 3.2. Efficient learning of dynamic sparsity is notoriously difficult under the constraint of the current parallel hardware [LQC ${ }^{+} 22$; GZYE20; XM22]. To enable the practical efficiency gains from our module-level sparsity, we provide a simple yet efficient parallel implementation of SMA without any custom fused GPU kernels. Specifically, when compressing a batch of sequences in SMA, our implementation conducts both token selection and the sequence re-padding simultaneously using a single scatter operation that is widely optimized and present in modern deep learning frameworks. To address RQ1, we apply SMA to construct a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, that sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) [HDLL22] based on the state representation learned from an SSM. Both the GAU and the SSM representations are then aggregated through simple addition and activation to form a layer-level representation. Multiple same-sized SeqBoat layers are stacked sequentially to form a full neural model. Inspired by the working memory mechanism [AS68] used in human cognition, we further restrict the GAU to only apply local attention on the compressed sequence, which allows our model to have linear sequence inference complexity but theoretically infinite attention span. We conduct comprehensive experiments to show that SeqBoat has significantly better qualityefficiency trade-off than state-of-the-art hybrid models on a wide range of tasks, including Long Range Arena (LRA) [TDA ${ }^{+}$20], speech classification [War18] and language modeling [Hut06]. On the competitive LRA benchmark, SeqBoat achieves 1.96 higher average accuracy than MEGA-chunk $\\left[\\mathrm{MZK}^{+} 23\\right]$, the previous best hybrid model, with a $10.4 \\times$ training speed up and a $95 \\%$ memory reduction compared to the Transformer [VSP ${ }^{+}$17] on the Text task with 4,096 input length. Thanks to the intrinsic modular sparsity brought by SMA, SeqBoat directly reveals the amount of attention needed for each data sample of each task through its sparse activation patterns of GAU, addressing RQ2. We demonstrate that our working memory mechanism provides substantially better computation-accuracy trade-off than chunking based models, and analyze the relationship between the working memory size and the effective attention span on various long sequence modeling tasks. ## 2 Background\n\nTo motivate and clarify our proposed techniques, we first present a mathematical formulation of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism and show how it encompasses and generalizes previous attempts that aimed for module-level dynamic sparsity. A dedicated section for detailed comparisons between our approach with the related works is also included in Appendix F. We begin by reviewing how the standard sequence modeling is formalized to establish the common ground for our discussion. ### 2.1 Time-Invariant Sequence Modeling\n\nGiven a discrete sequence, $\\mathbf{x}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}\\right\\} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, consisting of $n$ tokens, a time-invariant sequence model $P_{\\theta}$ is optimized to maximize the likelihood of the observed sequences by factorizing them as follows:\n\n$$\n\\max _{\\theta} P_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{<t}, \\theta\\right)\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}=\\left\\{x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{t-1}\\right\\}$ is the sequence history at time step $t$, and the parameter $\\theta$ is independent of the time step $t$. This formulation implies that the full model parameters $\\theta$ and the full history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$ are both essential for the conditional prediction of each token $x_{t}$. However, one potential issue is as the prediction difficulty of each token may differ depending on the context and the position, this static model $P_{\\theta}$ can lead to sub-optimal accuracy-efficiency trade-off by wasting computation on either unimportant context $\\left[\\mathrm{SJP}^{+} 21\\right]$ or easy-to-predict tokens [Gra16]. ## 3 Learning Sparse Modular Activation\n\nTo cover a larger search space that may contain more efficient sequence models, we propose to formulate sequence modeling as a problem of finding an optimal time-variant model that can dynamically activate a subset of modules from a pre-defined function space for each time step. ### 3.1 Time-Variant Sequence Modeling\n\nFormally, a time-variant sequence model is defined on a compact function space $\\mathcal{F}: \\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$, where $V$ is the size of the vocabulary and $\\mathcal{X}_{t}^{c}=\\left\\{\\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}: \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t} \\in \\mathcal{X} \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^{n}\\right\\}$, contains all possible sub-sequences of the sequence history $\\mathbf{x}_{<t}$. Then for each of the token prediction at the time step $t$, the model learns to apply a function $f_{t} \\in \\mathcal{F}$ with the parameters $\\theta_{t}$ that maximizes the sequence probability, i.e.,\n\n$$\n\\max _{f_{t}, \\theta_{t}, \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}} P_{\\mathcal{F}}(\\mathbf{x})=\\prod_{t=1}^{n} P_{f_{t}}\\left(x_{t} \\mid \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c}, \\theta_{t}\\right) \\quad \\text { s.t. } \\quad \\mathbf{x}_{t}^{c} \\subseteq \\mathbf{x}_{<t}\n$$\n\nThis formulation generalizes the previous works in pursuing a dynamic and sparse model for sequence modeling, where the connections are further explained in Appendix F. In this work, we assume the function space $\\mathcal{F}$ is chain-structured, i.e., $\\mathcal{F}=\\mathcal{H} \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{N} \\circ \\cdots \\circ \\mathcal{L}_{1} \\circ \\mathcal{E}$, where $\\mathcal{H}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto[0,1]^{n \\times V}$ is the classification function, $\\mathcal{E}: \\mathbb{R}^{n} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the embedding function, $N$ is the number of intermediate layers, $d_{m}$ is the model size and $\\mathcal{L}: \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d_{m}}$ is the function space of the intermediate mappings. We further assume that $\\mathcal{L}$ is the spanning set of a finite number of the function $f_{i}^{l}$ with its parameters $\\theta_{i}^{l}$, i.e., $\\mathcal{L}=\\operatorname{span}\\left\\{f_{1}^{l}, \\ldots, f_{M}^{l}\\right\\}$, where $M$ is the number of pre-defined functions. These assumptions justify the design of our Sparse Modular Activation mechanism, which is further explained in the following section. ### 3.2 Sparse Modular Activation\n\nSparse Modular Activation (SMA) introduces a latent configurator at each time step $t$ and each layer of a neural sequence model.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and the most useful information extracted from the analysis:\n\n### Goal and Intent\nThe researcher aims to develop a novel LM block, termed \"SparseStateGAU,\" which integrates several innovative components to enhance performance, efficiency, and scalability.

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pp. 1525-1534, Berlin, Germany, August 2016.

Switch transformers: Scaling to trillion parameter models with simple and efficient sparsity.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nThe $x$ axis is in $\\log$ scale. ## 1 Introduction\n\nThe past few years have seen the power of scaling (Kaplan et al. 2020 Hoffmann et al. 2022): increasing the number of parameters, amount of training data, or the computational budget has proven to be a reliable\nway to improve model performance. Notably, feedforward (FFW) layers, responsible for storing factual knowledge (Geva et al., 2021, Dai et al. 2022, account for two-thirds of the total parameters in a transformer. However, one drawback of these dense FFWs is that their computational footprint (FLOPs and device memory consumption) is linearly proportional to their parameter count. To break the coupling between computational cost and parameter count, many recent works (Shazeer et al. 2017, Lepikhin et al. 2020; Fedus et al., 2022, Zhou et al. 2022) have adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, which uses a set of sparsely activated expert modules (often FFWs) in place of a single dense FFW. Clark et al. (2022) studied the scaling law of MoE language models and showed that increasing the number of experts is an effective way to improve performance without increasing the inference cost. However, their experiments showed that the efficiency gains provided by MoEs plateau after a certain model size is reached. More recently, Krajewski et al. (2024) discovered that this plateau was caused by using a fixed number of training tokens. When the number of training tokens is compute-optimal, MoEs consistently outperform dense models in terms of FLOP efficiency. Moreover, they introduced granularity (the number of active experts) as a new scaling axis and empirically showed that using higher granularity improves performance. Extrapolating this fine-grained MoE scaling law suggests that continued improvement of model capacity will ultimately lead to a large model with high granularity, corresponding to an architecture of an immense number of tiny experts. Beyond efficient scaling, another reason to have a vast number of experts is lifelong learning, where MoE has emerged as a promising approach Aljundi et al., 2017, Chen et al., 2023, Yu et al., 2024, Li et al. 2024). For instance, Chen et al. (2023) showed that, by simply adding new experts and regularizing them properly, MoE models can adapt to continuous data streams. Freezing old experts and updating only new ones prevents catastrophic forgetting and maintains plasticity by design. In lifelong learning settings, the data stream can be indefinitely long or never-ending Mitchell et al. 2018, necessitating an expanding pool of experts. Although both efficient scaling and lifelong learning require MoE designs capable of handling a vast number of experts, to the best of our knowledge, the only architecture supporting more than ten thousands of experts is the Mixture of Word Experts (MoWE) dos Santos et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/38 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\n# MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression \n\nTianyu Fu ${ }^{1,2, *}$ Haofeng Huang ${ }^{1,2, *}$, Xuefei Ning ${ }^{1, *}$, Genghan Zhang ${ }^{3}$, Boju Chen ${ }^{1}$,<br>Tianqi Wu ${ }^{1,2}$, Hongyi Wang ${ }^{1,2}$, Zixiao Huang ${ }^{1,2}$, Shiyao $\\mathbf{L i}^{1,2}$,<br>Shengen Yan ${ }^{1,2}$, Guohao Dai ${ }^{2,4}$, Huazhong Yang ${ }^{1}$, Yu Wang ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ Tsinghua University ${ }^{2}$ Infinigence-AI ${ }^{3}$ Stanford University ${ }^{4}$ Shanghai Jiao Tong University\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nSparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 14 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Sparse mixture-of-experts language models, Test-time adaptation transformers, Efficient state compression\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Keutzer, Yuxiong He*\n\n**TL;DR:** The effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models is explored, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** The field of natural language processing (NLP) has made significant strides in recent years, particularly in the development of large-scale vision-language models (VLMs). These models aim to bridge the gap between text and visual information, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of multimedia data. However, as these models become larger and more complex, they also become more challenging to train and deploy. One approach to addressing this challenge is the use of sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) techniques, which divide the model into smaller, specialized sub-models that can jointly solve a task. In this paper, we explore the effectiveness of MoE in scaling vision-language models, demonstrating its potential to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a range of benchmarks over dense models of equivalent computational cost. Our research offers valuable insights into stabilizing the training of MoE models, understanding the impact of MoE on model interpretability, and balancing the trade-offs between compute performance when scaling VLMs. We hope our work will inspire further research into the use of MoE for scaling large-scale vision-language models and other multimodal machine learning applications.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

Darrell, Denny Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** The advancements embodied by FLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a neural architecture design that can be utilized to add learnable parameters to Large Language Models (LLMs) without increasing inference cost. Instruction tuning is a technique for training LLMs to follow instructions. We advocate combining these two approaches, as we find that MoE models benefit more from instruction tuning than dense models. In particular, we conduct empirical studies across three experimental setups: (i) Direct finetuning on individual downstream tasks devoid of instruction tuning; (ii) Instructiontuning followed by in-context few-shot or zero-shot generalization on downstream tasks; and (iii) Instruction tuning supplemented by further finetuning on individual downstream tasks. In the first scenario, MoE models overall underperform dense models of identical computational capacity. This narrative, however, dramatically changes with the introduction of instruction tuning (second and third scenario), used independently or in conjunction with task-specific finetuning. Our most powerful model, FLAN-MOE-32B, surpasses the performance of FLAN-PALM-62B on four benchmark tasks, while using only a third of the FLOPs. The advancements embodied byFLAN-MOE inspire a reevaluation of the design principles of large-scale, high-performance language models in the framework of task-agnostic learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time adaptation transformers*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n#### 4. TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time adaptation transformers*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. Tent: Fully Test-Time Adaptation by Entropy Minimization\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time adaptation transformers*\n\n*Dequan Wang, Evan Shelhamer, Shaoteng Liu, B. Olshausen, Trevor Darrell*\n\n**TL;DR:** Tent reduces generalization error for image classification on corrupted ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 and reaches a new state-of-the-art error on ImageNet-C, and optimize the model for confidence as measured by the entropy of its predictions.\n\n**Abstract:** A model must adapt itself to generalize to new and different data during testing. In this setting of fully test-time adaptation the model has only the test data and its own parameters. We propose to adapt by test entropy minimization (tent1): we optimize the model for confidence as measured by the entropy of its predictions. Our method estimates normalization statistics and optimizes channel-wise affine transformations to update online on each batch. Tent reduces generalization error for image classification on corrupted ImageNet and CIFAR-10/100 and reaches a new state-of-the-art error on ImageNet-C. Tent handles source-free domain adaptation on digit recognition from SVHN to MNIST/MNIST-M/USPS, on semantic segmentation from GTA to Cityscapes, and on the VisDA-C benchmark. These results are achieved in one epoch of test-time optimization without altering training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 823  (*Influential: 298*)\n\n#### 6. COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods and can be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training and lower extra storage cost than the existing works.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7.

However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. MING-MOE: Enhancing Medical Multi-Task Learning in Large Language Models with Sparse Mixture of Low-Rank Adapter Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse mixture-of-experts language models*\n\n*Yanfeng Wang, Yu Wang, Shuyang Jiang, Yusheng Liao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models like ChatGPT have shown substantial progress in natural language understanding and generation, proving valuable across various disciplines, including the medical field. Despite advancements, challenges persist due to the complexity and diversity inherent in medical tasks which often require multi-task learning capabilities. Previous approaches, although beneficial, fall short in real-world applications because they necessitate task-specific annotations at inference time, limiting broader generalization. This paper introduces MING-MOE, a novel Mixture-of-Expert~(MOE)-based medical large language model designed to manage diverse and complex medical tasks without requiring task-specific annotations, thus enhancing its usability across extensive datasets. MING-MOE employs a Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation (MoLoRA) technique, allowing for efficient parameter usage by maintaining base model parameters static while adapting through a minimal set of trainable parameters. We demonstrate that MING-MOE achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on over 20 medical tasks, illustrating a significant improvement over existing models. This approach not only extends the capabilities of medical language models but also improves inference efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$: Towards Building Reliable Language Models with Sparse Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Sparse mixture-of-experts language models*\n\n*Yu Cheng, Tianlong Chen, Xinyu Zhao, Guanjie Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has gained increasing popularity as a promising framework for scaling up large language models (LLMs). However, the reliability assessment of MoE lags behind its surging applications. Moreover, when transferred to new domains such as in fine-tuning MoE models sometimes underperform their dense counterparts. Motivated by the research gap and counter-intuitive phenomenon, we propose $\\texttt{MoE-RBench}$, the first comprehensive assessment of SMoE reliability from three aspects: $\\textit{(i)}$ safety and hallucination, $\\textit{(ii)}$ resilience to adversarial attacks, and $\\textit{(iii)}$ out-of-distribution robustness. Extensive models and datasets are tested to compare the MoE to dense networks from these reliability dimensions. Our empirical observations suggest that with appropriate hyperparameters, training recipes, and inference techniques, we can build the MoE model more reliably than the dense LLM. In particular, we find that the robustness of SMoE is sensitive to the basic training settings. We hope that this study can provide deeper insights into how to adapt the pre-trained MoE model to other tasks with higher-generation security, quality, and stability.

TIPI: Test Time Adaptation With Transformation Invariance\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time adaptation transformers*\n\n*Philip H.S. Torr, Ser-Nam Lim, Thanh Nguyen-Tang, A. Tuan Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:**     When deploying a machine learning model to a new environment, we often encounter the distribution shift problem -- meaning the target data distribution is different from the model's training distribution. In this paper, we assume that labels are not provided for this new domain, and that we do not store the source data (e.g., for privacy reasons). It has been shown that even small shifts in the data distribution can affect the model's performance severely. Test Time Adaptation offers a means to combat this problem, as it allows the model to adapt during test time to the new data distribution, using only unlabeled test data batches. To achieve this, the predominant approach is to optimize a surrogate loss on the test-time unlabeled target data. In particular, minimizing the prediction's entropy on target samples has received much interest as it is task-agnostic and does not require altering the model's training phase (e.g., does not require adding a self-supervised task during training on the source domain). However, as the target data's batch size is often small in real-world scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving models process each few frames in real-time), we argue that this surrogate loss is not optimal since it often collapses with small batch sizes. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we propose to use an invariance regularizer as the surrogate loss during test-time adaptation, motivated by our theoretical results regarding the model's performance under input transformations. The resulting method (TIPI -- Test tIme adaPtation with transformation Invariance) is validated with extensive experiments in various benchmarks (Cifar10-C, Cifar100-C, ImageNet-C, DIGITS, and VisDA17). Remarkably, TIPI is robust against small batch sizes (as small as 2 in our experiments), and consistently outperforms TENT in all settings.

Domain-Conditioned Transformer for Fully Test-time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Test-time adaptation transformers*\n\n*Zhihai He, Yi Zhang, Jiyuan Jia, Shuoshuo Chen, Yushun Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Fully test-time adaptation aims to adapt a network model online based on sequential analysis of input samples during the inference stage. We observe that, when applying a transformer network model into a new domain, the self-attention profiles of image samples in the target domain deviate significantly from those in the source domain, which results in large performance degradation during domain changes. To address this important issue, we propose a new structure for the self-attention modules in the transformer. Specifically, we incorporate three domain-conditioning vectors, called domain conditioners, into the query, key, and value components of the self-attention module. We learn a network to generate these three domain conditioners from the class token at each transformer network layer. We find that, during fully online test-time adaptation, these domain conditioners at each transform network layer are able to gradually remove the impact of domain shift and largely recover the original self-attention profile. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed domain-conditioned transformer significantly improves the online fully test-time domain adaptation performance and outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods by large margins.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 5. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: Efficient state compression*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 6.

An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that combines sparse activation, test-time adaptation, efficient state management, and hardware-efficient implementations, here are some key areas and specific information that can be particularly useful:\n\n### Novelty of Combining Sparse Activation with Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- **Existing Models:**\n  - The Switch Transformers introduce a sparse model using a gating network to route tokens to expert networks.

Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 4. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.50)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.50)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 70/94 (Score: 0.25)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems, pages 5754-5764, 2019. [102] Z.

Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity language models*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

Compressing these models into smaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural network compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization are limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this paper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder framework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular Transformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or more consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and knowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly assembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different performance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a single training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular Transformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with little to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters.

Previous works build entropy models upon convolutional neural networks which are inefficient in capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently. Different from vision transformers in image classification, the Entroformer is highly optimized for image compression, including a top-k self-attention and a diamond relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we further expand this architecture with a parallel bidirectional context model to speed up the decoding process. The experiments show that the Entroformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n#### 6.

However, in real-world situations, domain shift often exits and significantly affects the accuracy of existing out-of-distribution (OOD) detection models. In this work, we propose a dual-level OOD detection framework to handle domain shift and semantic shift jointly. The first level distinguishes whether domain shift exists in the image by leveraging global low-level features, while the second level identifies pixels with semantic shift by utilizing dense high-level feature maps. In this way, we can selectively adapt the model to unseen domains as well as enhance model's capacity in detecting novel classes. We validate the efficacy of our proposed method on several OOD segmentation benchmarks, including those with significant domain shifts and those without, observing consistent performance improvements across various baseline models.

TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware test-time adaptation*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware test-time adaptation*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 56*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Finding Neurons in a Haystack: Case Studies with Sparse Probing\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity language models*\n\n*Dimitris Bertsimas, Dmitrii Troitskii, Katherine Harvey, Matthew Pauly, Neel Nanda, Wes Gurnee*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite rapid adoption and deployment of large language models (LLMs), the internal computations of these models remain opaque and poorly understood. In this work, we seek to understand how high-level human-interpretable features are represented within the internal neuron activations of LLMs. We train $k$-sparse linear classifiers (probes) on these internal activations to predict the presence of features in the input; by varying the value of $k$ we study the sparsity of learned representations and how this varies with model scale. With $k=1$, we localize individual neurons which are highly relevant for a particular feature, and perform a number of case studies to illustrate general properties of LLMs. In particular, we show that early layers make use of sparse combinations of neurons to represent many features in superposition, that middle layers have seemingly dedicated neurons to represent higher-level contextual features, and that increasing scale causes representational sparsity to increase on average, but there are multiple types of scaling dynamics. In all, we probe for over 100 unique features comprising 10 different categories in 7 different models spanning 70 million to 6.9 billion parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity language models*\n\n*Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan, Yuan-Fang Li, Yuxuan Liang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaoming Shi, James Y. Zhang, Zhixuan Chu, Lintao Ma, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 3. Funnel-Transformer: Filtering out Sequential Redundancy for Efficient Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression transformers*\n\n*Quoc V. Le, Zihang Dai, Yiming Yang, Guokun Lai*\n\n**Abstract:** With the success of language pretraining, it is highly desirable to develop more efficient architectures of good scalability that can exploit the abundant unlabeled data at a lower cost. To improve the efficiency, we examine the much-overlooked redundancy in maintaining a full-length token-level presentation, especially for tasks that only require a single-vector presentation of the sequence. With this intuition, we propose Funnel-Transformer which gradually compresses the sequence of hidden states to a shorter one and hence reduces the computation cost. More importantly, by re-investing the saved FLOPs from length reduction in constructing a deeper or wider model, we further improve the model capacity. In addition, to perform token-level predictions as required by common pretraining objectives, Funnel-Transformer is able to recover a deep representation for each token from the reduced hidden sequence via a decoder. Empirically, with comparable or fewer FLOPs, Funnel-Transformer outperforms the standard Transformer on a wide variety of sequence-level prediction tasks, including text classification, language understanding, and reading comprehension.

AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression transformers*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/38 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2306.00978, 2023.

Score: 0.21)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/30 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\nInspired by the $\\alpha$-entmax function introduced in Peters et al. [2019], Martins et al. [2020], we define the $\\alpha$-sigmoid (based on\nthe entropies proposed by Tsallis [1988]) as:\n\n$$\n\\sigma(x)=\\alpha-\\operatorname{sigmoid}(x)=\\operatorname{argmax}_{p \\in[0,1]}\\left(p \\cdot x+H_{\\alpha}(p)\\right),\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nH_{\\alpha}(p)=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\frac{1}{\\alpha(\\alpha-1)}\\left(p-p^{\\alpha}+(1-p)-(1-p)^{\\alpha}\\right), \\text { if } \\alpha \\neq 1 \\\\\n-p \\log p-(1-p) \\log (1-p), \\text { if } \\alpha=1\n\\end{array}\\right. $$\n\nBy varying $\\alpha$ during the training, we can control the sparsity in the network, i.e. regulate the softness of the pruning mechanism. In practice, we start from small values of $\\alpha=1$ and increase it according to a cosine scheduler, as shown in Fig. 3. Small values of $\\alpha$ allow meaningful gradient signals to pass through the dropping mechanism, which is crucial at the beginning of training. On the other hand, larger values of $\\alpha$ lead to sparse results desired during inference. We thus increase $\\alpha$ to values leading to very sparse solutions, as illustrated in Fig. 3. In practice, during inference, we replace $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ with the step function, that corresponds to $\\alpha \\rightarrow \\infty$. We also initialize the biases parameters $\\beta^{\\ell}$ in (6) to a positive value, ensuring that tokens at the beginning of training have a prior towards not being dropped. This strategy also facilitates fine-tuning existing pretrained models, as our module will initially default close to the identity function. The $\\alpha$-sigmoid along with the training schedule on $\\alpha$ allows for good signal propagation properties for the gradients [Noci et al., 2022]. We also explored using a regular sigmoid with a varying temperature [Kim et al., 2022], leading to suboptimal nonbinary predictions and instabilities during training. Training with our sparse sigmoid also directly eliminates the need of having any auxiliary network [Lee et al., 2023]. ### 3.3 Regularized Objective\n\nWe augment the regular language modeling objective with a regularization that incentivizes the network $f$ to drop parts of the sequence. We fine-tune pretrained models, with parameters $\\theta$, using the objective:\n\n$$\nL(\\theta, \\mathbf{T})=L_{l m}(\\theta, \\mathbf{T})+L_{\\text {sparsity }}(\\theta, \\mathbf{T})\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\nL_{l m}(\\theta, \\mathbf{T})=\\mathrm{CE}\\left(f_{\\theta}(\\mathbf{T}), \\operatorname{shift}(\\mathbf{T})\\right)\n$$\n\nis the regular cross-entropy loss for the language modeling task based on the original and shifted input tokens $\\mathbf{T}$, and\n\n$$\nL_{\\text {sparsity }}(\\theta, \\mathbf{T})=\\gamma \\frac{2}{\\operatorname{Ln}(n-1)} \\sum_{i, \\ell} \\mathbf{I}_{i, j}^{\\ell}\n$$\n\nis the sparsity loss, encouraging the model to prune the context.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 4.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2010.11929, 2020.

QA-LoRA: Quantization-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware adaptation language models*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaotao Gu, Xin Chen, Heng Chang, Hengheng Zhang, Zhensu Chen, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm that equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; and after fine- Tuning,the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

Kwon, Jeonghoon Kim, Jeongin Bae, Kang Min Yoo, Jin-Hwa Kim, Baeseong Park, Byeongwook Kim, Jung-Woo Ha, Nako Sung, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that AlphaTuning, when applied to GPT-2 and OPT, performs competitively with full fine-tuning on a variety of downstream tasks while achieving>10x compression ratio under 4-bit quantization and>1,000x reduction in the number of trainable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** There are growing interests in adapting large-scale language models using parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods. However, accelerating the model itself and achieving better inference efficiency through model compression has not been thoroughly explored yet. Model compression could provide the benefits of reducing memory footprints, enabling low-precision computations, and ultimately achieving cost-effective inference. To combine parameter-efficient adaptation and model compression, we propose AlphaTuning consisting of post-training quantization of the pre-trained language model and fine-tuning only some parts of quantized parameters for a target task. Specifically, AlphaTuning works by employing binary-coding quantization, which factorizes the full-precision parameters into binary parameters and a separate set of scaling factors. During the adaptation phase, the binary values are frozen for all tasks, while the scaling factors are fine-tuned for the downstream task. We demonstrate that AlphaTuning, when applied to GPT-2 and OPT, performs competitively with full fine-tuning on a variety of downstream tasks while achieving>10x compression ratio under 4-bit quantization and>1,000x reduction in the number of trainable parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware adaptation language models*\n\n*Nathan J. Hu, E. Mitchell, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. NISPA: Neuro-Inspired Stability-Plasticity Adaptation for Continual Learning in Sparse Networks\n\n*From Search Query: stability sparse adaptation transformers*\n\n*Mustafa Burak Gurbuz, C. Dovrolis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes the Neuro-Inspired Stability-Plasticity Adaptation (NISPA) architecture, a sparse neural network with fixed density that significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art continual learning baselines, and makes the case that sparsity is an essential ingredient for continual learning.\n\n**Abstract:** The goal of continual learning (CL) is to learn different tasks over time. The main desiderata associated with CL are to maintain performance on older tasks, leverage the latter to improve learning of future tasks, and to introduce minimal overhead in the training process (for instance, to not require a growing model or retraining). We propose the Neuro-Inspired Stability-Plasticity Adaptation (NISPA) architecture that addresses these desiderata through a sparse neural network with fixed density. NISPA forms stable paths to preserve learned knowledge from older tasks. Also, NISPA uses connection rewiring to create new plastic paths that reuse existing knowledge on novel tasks. Our extensive evaluation on EMNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR10, and CIFAR100 datasets shows that NISPA significantly outperforms representative state-of-the-art continual learning baselines, and it uses up to ten times fewer learnable parameters compared to baselines. We also make the case that sparsity is an essential ingredient for continual learning.

Mixed-effects transformers for hierarchical adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: stability sparse adaptation transformers*\n\n*Julia White, Noah D. Goodman, Robert D.

To some degree, large language models like GPT-3 account for such variation by conditioning on strings of initial input text, or prompts. However, prompting can be ineffective when contexts are sparse, out-of-sample, or extra-textual.

Continual Task Allocation in Meta-Policy Network via Sparse Prompting\n\n*From Search Query: stability sparse adaptation transformers*\n\n*Yijun Yang, Tianyi Zhou, Jing Jiang, Guodong Long, Yuhui Shi*\n\n**TL;DR:** Continual Task Allocation via Sparse Prompting (CoTASP), which learns over-complete dictionaries to produce sparse masks as prompts extracting a sub-network for each task from a meta-policy network, achieves a promising plasticity-stability trade-off without storing or replaying any past tasks' experiences.\n\n**Abstract:** How to train a generalizable meta-policy by continually learning a sequence of tasks? It is a natural human skill yet challenging to achieve by current reinforcement learning: the agent is expected to quickly adapt to new tasks (plasticity) meanwhile retaining the common knowledge from previous tasks (stability). We address it by\"Continual Task Allocation via Sparse Prompting (CoTASP)\", which learns over-complete dictionaries to produce sparse masks as prompts extracting a sub-network for each task from a meta-policy network. CoTASP trains a policy for each task by optimizing the prompts and the sub-network weights alternatively. The dictionary is then updated to align the optimized prompts with tasks' embedding, thereby capturing tasks' semantic correlations. Hence, relevant tasks share more neurons in the meta-policy network due to similar prompts while cross-task interference causing forgetting is effectively restrained. Given a meta-policy and dictionaries trained on previous tasks, new task adaptation reduces to highly efficient sparse prompting and sub-network finetuning. In experiments, CoTASP achieves a promising plasticity-stability trade-off without storing or replaying any past tasks' experiences. It outperforms existing continual and multi-task RL methods on all seen tasks, forgetting reduction, and generalization to unseen tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Super-Resolution with Second-Order Degradation and Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Zeshuai Deng, Zhuokun Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Thomas H. Li, Bohan Zhuang, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR is presented, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types, and designs a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier.\n\n**Abstract:** Image super-resolution (SR) aims to learn a mapping from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) using paired HR-LR training images. Conventional SR methods typically gather the paired training data by synthesizing LR images from HR images using a predetermined degradation model, e.g., Bicubic down-sampling. However, the realistic degradation type of test images may mismatch with the training-time degradation type due to the dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios, resulting in inferior-quality SR images. To address this, existing methods attempt to estimate the degradation model and train an image-specific model, which, however, is quite time-consuming and impracticable to handle rapidly changing domain shifts. Moreover, these methods largely concentrate on the estimation of one degradation type (e.g., blur degradation), overlooking other degradation types like noise and JPEG in real-world test-time scenarios, thus limiting their practicality. To tackle these problems, we present an efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types. Specifically, we design a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, which is predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier. Then, we adapt the SR model by implementing feature-level reconstruction learning from the initial test image to its second-order degraded counterparts, which helps the SR model generate plausible HR images. Extensive experiments are conducted on newly synthesized corrupted DIV2K datasets with 8 different degradations and several real-world datasets, demonstrating that our SRTTA framework achieves an impressive improvement over existing methods with satisfying speed.

Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Yaofo Chen, S. Zheng, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An active sample selection criterion is proposed to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation, and a Fisher regularizer is introduced to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels.

Effective solution of this problem requires adaptation of predictive models trained on the source domain to a target domain, using only unlabeled target domain data, without access to source domain data. Existing test-time adaptation methods for tabular data have difficulty coping with the heterogeneous features and their complex dependencies inherent in tabular data. To overcome these limitations, we consider test-time adaptation in the setting wherein the logical structure of the rules is assumed to remain invariant despite distribution shift between source and target domains whereas the numerical parameters associated with the rules and the weights assigned to them can vary to accommodate distribution shift. TabLog discretizes numerical features, models dependencies between heterogeneous features, introduces a novel contrastive loss for coping with distribution shift, and presents an end-to-end framework for efficient training and test-time adaptation by taking advantage of a logical neural network representation of a rule ensemble. We present results of experiments using several benchmark data sets that demonstrate TabLog is competitive with or improves upon the state-of-the-art methods for test-time adaptation of predictive models trained on tabular data.

Sequoia: Scalable, Robust, and Hardware-aware Speculative Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware adaptation language models*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Zhihao Jia, Max Ryabinin, Yuhsun Huang, Ruslan Svirschevski, Avner May, Zhuoming Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** As the usage of large language models (LLMs) grows, performing efficient inference with these models becomes increasingly important. While speculative decoding has recently emerged as a promising direction for speeding up inference, existing methods are limited in their ability to scale to larger speculation budgets, and adapt to different hyperparameters and hardware. This paper introduces Sequoia, a scalable, robust, and hardware-aware algorithm for speculative decoding. To attain better scalability, Sequoia introduces a dynamic programming algorithm to find the optimal tree structure for the speculated tokens. To achieve robust speculative performance, Sequoia uses a novel sampling and verification method that outperforms prior work across different decoding temperatures. Finally, Sequoia introduces a hardware-aware tree optimizer that maximizes speculative performance by automatically selecting the token tree size and depth for a given hardware platform. Evaluation shows that Sequoia improves the decoding speed of Llama2-7B, Llama2-13B, and Vicuna-33B on an A100 by up to $4.04\\times$, $3.73\\times$, and $2.27\\times$. For offloading setting on L40, Sequoia achieves as low as 0.56 s/token for exact Llama2-70B inference latency, which is $9.96\\times$ on our optimized offloading system (5.6 s/token), $9.7\\times$ than DeepSpeed-Zero-Inference, $19.5\\times$ than Huggingface Accelerate.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-19\n\n\n\n#### 2. Hardware-Aware Parallel Prompt Decoding for Memory-Efficient Acceleration of LLM Inference\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware adaptation language models*\n\n*Hongxiang Fan, Stylianos I. Venieris, Konstantin Mishchenko, Rui Li, Hao Mark Chen, Ka Fai Cedric Yiu, Wayne Luk*\n\n**Abstract:** The auto-regressive decoding of Large Language Models (LLMs) results in significant overheads in their hardware performance. While recent research has investigated various speculative decoding techniques for multi-token generation, these efforts have primarily focused on improving processing speed such as throughput. Crucially, they often neglect other metrics essential for real-life deployments, such as memory consumption and training cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel parallel prompt decoding that requires only $0.0002$% trainable parameters, enabling efficient training on a single A100-40GB GPU in just 16 hours. Inspired by the human natural language generation process, $PPD$ approximates outputs generated at future timesteps in parallel by using multiple prompt tokens. This approach partially recovers the missing conditional dependency information necessary for multi-token generation, resulting in up to a 28% higher acceptance rate for long-range predictions. Furthermore, we present a hardware-aware dynamic sparse tree technique that adaptively optimizes this decoding scheme to fully leverage the computational capacities on different GPUs. Through extensive experiments across LLMs ranging from MobileLlama to Vicuna-13B on a wide range of benchmarks, our approach demonstrates up to 2.49$\\times$ speedup and maintains a minimal runtime memory overhead of just $0.0004$%. More importantly, our parallel prompt decoding can serve as an orthogonal optimization for synergistic integration with existing speculative decoding, showing up to $1.22\\times$ further speed improvement.

AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: stability sparse adaptation transformers*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

A flexible method for estimating luminosity functions via Kernel Density Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: stability sparse adaptation transformers*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a flexible method for estimating luminosity functions (LFs) based\non kernel density estimation (KDE), the most popular nonparametric density\nestimation approach developed in modern statistics, to overcome issues\nsurrounding binning of LFs. One challenge in applying KDE to LFs is how to\ntreat the boundary bias problem, since astronomical surveys usually obtain\ntruncated samples predominantly due to the flux-density limits of surveys. We\nuse two solutions, the transformation KDE method ($\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{t}}$),\nand the transformation-reflection KDE method ($\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{tr}}$) to\nreduce the boundary bias. We develop a new likelihood cross-validation\ncriterion for selecting optimal bandwidths, based on which, the posterior\nprobability distribution of bandwidth and transformation parameters for\n$\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ are derived within a\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling procedure. The simulation result shows\nthat $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{t}}$ and $\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{tr}}$ perform better\nthan the traditional binned method, especially in the sparse data regime around\nthe flux-limit of a survey or at the bright-end of the LF. To further improve\nthe performance of our KDE methods, we develop the transformation-reflection\nadaptive KDE approach ($\\hat{\\phi}_{\\mathrm{tra}}$). Monte Carlo simulations\nsuggest that it has a good stability and reliability in performance, and is\naround an order of magnitude more accurate than using the binned method. By\napplying our adaptive KDE method to a quasar sample, we find that it achieves\nestimates comparable to the rigorous determination by a previous work, while\nmaking far fewer assumptions about the LF. The KDE method we develop has the\nadvantages of both parametric and non-parametric methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-30\n\n\n\n#### 5. Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Peter W. Battaglia, Alvaro Sanchez-Gonzalez, Meire Fortunato, Tobias Pfaff*\n\n**Abstract:** Mesh-based simulations are central to modeling complex physical systems in many disciplines across science and engineering. Mesh representations support powerful numerical integration methods and their resolution can be adapted to strike favorable trade-offs between accuracy and efficiency. However, high-dimensional scientific simulations are very expensive to run, and solvers and parameters must often be tuned individually to each system studied. Here we introduce MeshGraphNets, a framework for learning mesh-based simulations using graph neural networks. Our model can be trained to pass messages on a mesh graph and to adapt the mesh discretization during forward simulation. Our results show it can accurately predict the dynamics of a wide range of physical systems, including aerodynamics, structural mechanics, and cloth. The model's adaptivity supports learning resolution-independent dynamics and can scale to more complex state spaces at test time. Our method is also highly efficient, running 1-2 orders of magnitude faster than the simulation on which it is trained. Our approach broadens the range of problems on which neural network simulators can operate and promises to improve the efficiency of complex, scientific modeling tasks.\n\n**Conference:** learning-mesh-based-simulation-with-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-07\n\n\n\n#### 6. HotFlip: White-Box Adversarial Examples for Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Daniel Lowd, Javid Ebrahimi, Dejing Dou, Anyi Rao*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an efficient method to generate white-box adversarial examples to\ntrick a character-level neural classifier. We find that only a few\nmanipulations are needed to greatly decrease the accuracy. Our method relies on\nan atomic flip operation, which swaps one token for another, based on the\ngradients of the one-hot input vectors. Due to efficiency of our method, we can\nperform adversarial training which makes the model more robust to attacks at\ntest time. With the use of a few semantics-preserving constraints, we\ndemonstrate that HotFlip can be adapted to attack a word-level classifier as\nwell.\n\n**Conference:** hotflip-white-box-adversarial-examples-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-12-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the \"SparseStateGAU\" architecture, that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are some key areas and specific information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Key Areas of Focus\n\n1. **Hardware-Aware Test-Time Adaptation:**\n   - The researcher needs to find recent studies or methods that optimize test-time adaptation for hardware efficiency.

Forward Pass:\n```python\ndef _forward(self, X, **Z):\n    # Apply sparse activation\n    active_x, mask = self.sparse_activator(X)\n    \n    # Process active states\n    if mask.sum() > 0:\n        processed = self.dense_processor(active_x)\n        compressed = self.state_compressor(processed)\n        \n        # Apply test-time adaptation\n        if self.training:\n            adapted = self.test_time_adapter(compressed)\n        else:\n            adapted = compressed\n    else:\n        adapted = X\n    \n    # Final normalization\n    return self.norm(adapted)\n```\n\n2.
