Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Addressing Some Limitations of Transformers with Feedback Memory (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Angela Fan, Thibaut Lavril, Edouard Grave, Armand Joulin, Sainbayar Sukhbaatar*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv (2020)\t**Cited by** None  (*Influential: None*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Transformers have shortcomings - limited memory and limited state update - but Feedback Memory is a straightforward way to resolve these. \n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have been successfully applied to sequential, auto-regressive tasks despite being feedforward networks. Unlike recurrent neural networks, Transformers use attention to capture temporal relations while processing input tokens in parallel. While this parallelization makes them computationally efficient, it restricts the model from fully exploiting the sequential nature of the input. The representation at a given layer can only access representations from lower layers, rather than the higher level representations already available. In this work, we propose the Feedback Transformer architecture that exposes all previous representations to all future representations, meaning the lowest representation of the current timestep is formed from the highest-level abstract representation of the past. We demonstrate on a variety of benchmarks in language modeling, machine translation, and reinforcement learning that the increased representation capacity can create small, shallow models with much stronger performance than comparable Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/30 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/1910.06764, 2019.

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

Score: 0.86)\n\n*Rares Dolga, Marius Cobzarenco, David Barber*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A method to reduce the time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors is introduced, which allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n**Abstract:** The time complexity of the standard attention mechanism in a transformer scales quadratically with the length of the sequence. We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/21 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2212.14052, 2022.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Adaptive Estimators Show Information Compression in Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural compression*\n\n*Ivan Chelombiev, Conor J. Houghton, Cian O\u2019Donnell*\n\n**TL;DR:** More robust mutual information estimation techniques are developed, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions, which explore compression in networks with a range of different activation functions.\n\n**Abstract:** To improve how neural networks function it is crucial to understand their learning process. The information bottleneck theory of deep learning proposes that neural networks achieve good generalization by compressing their representations to disregard information that is not relevant to the task. However, empirical evidence for this theory is conflicting, as compression was only observed when networks used saturating activation functions. In contrast, networks with non-saturating activation functions achieved comparable levels of task performance but did not show compression. In this paper we developed more robust mutual information estimation techniques, that adapt to hidden activity of neural networks and produce more sensitive measurements of activations from all functions, especially unbounded functions. Using these adaptive estimation techniques, we explored compression in networks with a range of different activation functions. With two improved methods of estimation, firstly, we show that saturation of the activation function is not required for compression, and the amount of compression varies between different activation functions. We also find that there is a large amount of variation in compression between different network initializations. Secondary, we see that L2 regularization leads to significantly increased compression, while preventing overfitting. Finally, we show that only compression of the last layer is positively correlated with generalization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2. Variable-Bitrate Neural Compression via Bayesian Arithmetic Coding\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural compression*\n\n*Yibo Yang, Robert Bamler, S. Mandt*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Bayesian latent variable models have enabled new approaches to both model and data compression. Here, we propose a new algorithm for compressing latent representations in deep probabilistic models, such as variational autoencoders, in post-processing. The approach thus separates model design and training from the compression task. Our algorithm generalizes arithmetic coding to the continuous domain, using adaptive discretization accuracy that exploits estimates of posterior uncertainty. A consequence of the \"plug and play\" nature of our approach is that various rate-distortion trade-offs can be achieved with a single trained model, eliminating the need to train multiple models for different bit rates. Our experimental results demonstrate the importance of taking into account posterior uncertainties, and show that image compression with the proposed algorithm outperforms JPEG over a wide range of bit rates using only a single machine learning model. Further experiments on Bayesian neural word embeddings demonstrate the versatility of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Flexible Neural Image Compression via Code Editing\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural compression*\n\n*Chenjian Gao, Tongda Xu, Dailan He, Hongwei Qin, Yan Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results show that the proposed Code Editing method surpasses existing variable-rate methods, and achieves ROI coding and multi-distortion trade-off with a single decoder.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural image compression (NIC) has outperformed traditional image codecs in rate-distortion (R-D) performance. However, it usually requires a dedicated encoder-decoder pair for each point on R-D curve, which greatly hinders its practical deployment. While some recent works have enabled bitrate control via conditional coding, they impose strong prior during training and provide limited flexibility. In this paper we propose Code Editing, a highly flexible coding method for NIC based on semi-amortized inference and adaptive quantization. Our work is a new paradigm for variable bitrate NIC. Furthermore, experimental results show that our method surpasses existing variable-rate methods, and achieves ROI coding and multi-distortion trade-off with a single decoder.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. RLx2: Training a Sparse Deep Reinforcement Learning Model from Scratch\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation deep learning*\n\n*Y. Tan, Pihe Hu, L. Pan, Longbo Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel sparse DRL training framework, RLx2, which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse D RL model based entirely on a sparse network, and introduces a novel multi-step TD target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models.\n\n**Abstract:** Training deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models usually requires high computation costs. Therefore, compressing DRL models possesses immense potential for training acceleration and model deployment. However, existing methods that generate small models mainly adopt the knowledge distillation-based approach by iteratively training a dense network. As a result, the training process still demands massive computing resources. Indeed, sparse training from scratch in DRL has not been well explored and is particularly challenging due to non-stationarity in bootstrap training. In this work, we propose a novel sparse DRL training framework,\"the Rigged Reinforcement Learning Lottery\"(RLx2), which builds upon gradient-based topology evolution and is capable of training a sparse DRL model based entirely on a sparse network. Specifically, RLx2 introduces a novel multi-step TD target mechanism with a dynamic-capacity replay buffer to achieve robust value learning and efficient topology exploration in sparse models. It also reaches state-of-the-art sparse training performance in several tasks, showing 7.5\\times-20\\times model compression with less than 3% performance degradation and up to 20\\times and 50\\times FLOPs reduction for training and inference, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. VRL3: A Data-Driven Framework for Visual Deep Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation deep learning*\n\n*Che Wang, Xufang Luo, K. Ross, Dongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** On a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse reward and realistic visual inputs, compared to the previous SOTA, VRL3 achieves an average of 780% better sample efficiency and on the hardest task,VRL3 is 1220% more sample efficient and solves the task with only 10% of the computation.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose VRL3, a powerful data-driven framework with a simple design for solving challenging visual deep reinforcement learning (DRL) tasks. We analyze a number of major obstacles in taking a data-driven approach, and present a suite of design principles, novel findings, and critical insights about data-driven visual DRL. Our framework has three stages: in stage 1, we leverage non-RL datasets (e.g. ImageNet) to learn task-agnostic visual representations; in stage 2, we use offline RL data (e.g. a limited number of expert demonstrations) to convert the task-agnostic representations into more powerful task-specific representations; in stage 3, we fine-tune the agent with online RL. On a set of challenging hand manipulation tasks with sparse reward and realistic visual inputs, compared to the previous SOTA, VRL3 achieves an average of 780% better sample efficiency. And on the hardest task, VRL3 is 1220% more sample efficient (2440% when using a wider encoder) and solves the task with only 10% of the computation. These significant results clearly demonstrate the great potential of data-driven deep reinforcement learning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6.

Houlsby*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes sparse upcycling -- a simple way to reuse sunk training costs by initializing a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts model from a dense checkpoint, and shows that sparsely upcycled T5 Base, Large, and XL language models and Vision Transformer Base and Large models, respectively, significantly outperform their dense counterparts on SuperGLUE and ImageNet.\n\n**Abstract:** Training large, deep neural networks to convergence can be prohibitively expensive. As a result, often only a small selection of popular, dense models are reused across different contexts and tasks. Increasingly, sparsely activated models, which seek to decouple model size from computation costs, are becoming an attractive alternative to dense models. Although more efficient in terms of quality and computation cost, sparse models remain data-hungry and costly to train from scratch in the large scale regime. In this work, we propose sparse upcycling -- a simple way to reuse sunk training costs by initializing a sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts model from a dense checkpoint. We show that sparsely upcycled T5 Base, Large, and XL language models and Vision Transformer Base and Large models, respectively, significantly outperform their dense counterparts on SuperGLUE and ImageNet, using only ~50% of the initial dense pretraining sunk cost. The upcycled models also outperform sparse models trained from scratch on 100% of the initial dense pretraining computation budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 78  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 7. Temporal Efficient Training of Spiking Neural Network via Gradient Re-weighting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient propagation*\n\n*Shi-Wee Deng, Yuhang Li, Shanghang Zhang, Shi Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes why the current direct training approach with surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability, and introduces the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process can converge into flatter minima with better generalIZability.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest because of their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics. Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to the non-differentiability of its activation function, which disables the typically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Although the adoption of surrogate gradient (SG) formally allows for the back-propagation of losses, the discrete spiking mechanism actually differentiates the loss landscape of SNNs from that of ANNs, failing the surrogate gradient methods to achieve comparable accuracy as for ANNs. In this paper, we first analyze why the current direct training approach with surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability. Then we introduce the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process can converge into flatter minima with better generalizability. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that TET improves the temporal scalability of SNN and induces a temporal inheritable training for acceleration. Our method consistently outperforms the SOTA on all reported mainstream datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Remarkably on DVS-CIFAR10, we obtained 83$\\%$ top-1 accuracy, over 10$\\%$ improvement compared to existing state of the art.

Efficient Neural Network Training via Forward and Backward Propagation Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient propagation*\n\n*Xiao Zhou, Weizhong Zhang, Zonghao Chen, Shizhe Diao, Tong Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an efficient sparse training method with completely sparse forward and backward passes, and proposes a variance reduced policy gradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward propagation, thus achieving completely sparse training.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse training is a natural idea to accelerate the training speed of deep neural networks and save the memory usage, especially since large modern neural networks are significantly over-parameterized. However, most of the existing methods cannot achieve this goal in practice because the chain rule based gradient (w.r.t. structure parameters) estimators adopted by previous methods require dense computation at least in the backward propagation step. This paper solves this problem by proposing an efficient sparse training method with completely sparse forward and backward passes. We first formulate the training process as a continuous minimization problem under global sparsity constraint. We then separate the optimization process into two steps, corresponding to weight update and structure parameter update. For the former step, we use the conventional chain rule, which can be sparse via exploiting the sparse structure. For the latter step, instead of using the chain rule based gradient estimators as in existing methods, we propose a variance reduced policy gradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward propagation, thus achieving completely sparse training. We prove that the variance of our gradient estimator is bounded. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that compared to previous methods, our algorithm is much more effective in accelerating the training process, up to an order of magnitude faster.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. PLASTIC: Improving Input and Label Plasticity for Sample Efficient Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient propagation*\n\n*Hojoon Lee, Hanseul Cho, Hyunseung Kim, Daehoon Gwak, Joonkee Kim, J. Choo, Se-Young Yun, Chulhee Yun*\n\n**TL;DR:** The PLASTIC algorithm is introduced, which harmoniously combines techniques to address input and label plasticity and achieves competitive performance on benchmarks including Atari-100k and Deepmind Control Suite.\n\n**Abstract:** In Reinforcement Learning (RL), enhancing sample efficiency is crucial, particularly in scenarios when data acquisition is costly and risky. In principle, off-policy RL algorithms can improve sample efficiency by allowing multiple updates per environment interaction. However, these multiple updates often lead the model to overfit to earlier interactions, which is referred to as the loss of plasticity. Our study investigates the underlying causes of this phenomenon by dividing plasticity into two aspects. Input plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to changing input data, and label plasticity, which denotes the model's adaptability to evolving input-output relationships. Synthetic experiments on the CIFAR-10 dataset reveal that finding smoother minima of loss landscape enhances input plasticity, whereas refined gradient propagation improves label plasticity. Leveraging these findings, we introduce the PLASTIC algorithm, which harmoniously combines techniques to address both concerns. With minimal architectural modifications, PLASTIC achieves competitive performance on benchmarks including Atari-100k and Deepmind Control Suite. This result emphasizes the importance of preserving the model's plasticity to elevate the sample efficiency in RL.

AdaBERT: Task-Adaptive BERT Compression with Differentiable Neural Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural compression*\n\n*Wei. Lin, Jingren Zhou, Yaliang Li, Jun Huang, Hongbo Deng, Daoyuan Chen, Bofang Li, Zhen Wang, Minghui Qiu, Bolin Ding*\n\n**Abstract:** Large pre-trained language models such as BERT have shown their effectiveness in various natural language processing tasks. However, the huge parameter size makes them difficult to be deployed in real-time applications that require quick inference with limited resources. Existing methods compress BERT into small models while such compression is task-independent, i.e., the same compressed BERT for all different downstream tasks. Motivated by the necessity and benefits of task-oriented BERT compression, we propose a novel compression method, AdaBERT, that leverages differentiable Neural Architecture Search to automatically compress BERT into task-adaptive small models for specific tasks. We incorporate a task-oriented knowledge distillation loss to provide search hints and an efficiency-aware loss as search constraints, which enables a good trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness for task-adaptive BERT compression. We evaluate AdaBERT on several NLP tasks, and the results demonstrate that those task-adaptive compressed models are 12.7x to 29.3x faster than BERT in inference time and 11.5x to 17.0x smaller in terms of parameter size, while comparable performance is maintained.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. Context-adaptive neural network based prediction for image compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural compression*\n\n*Thierry Dumas, Aline Roumy, Christine Guillemot*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper describes a set of neural network architectures, called Prediction Neural Networks Set (PNNS), based on both fully-connected and convolutional neural networks, for intra image prediction. The choice of neural network for predicting a given image block depends on the block size, hence does not need to be signalled to the decoder. It is shown that, while fully-connected neural networks give good performance for small block sizes, convolutional neural networks provide better predictions in large blocks with complex textures. Thanks to the use of masks of random sizes during training, the neural networks of PNNS well adapt to the available context that may vary, depending on the position of the image block to be predicted. When integrating PNNS into a H.265 codec, PSNR-rate performance gains going from 1.46% to 5.20% are obtained. These gains are on average 0.99% larger than those of prior neural network based methods. Unlike the H.265 intra prediction modes, which are each specialized in predicting a specific texture, the proposed PNNS can model a large set of complex textures.\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 3. Scalable Training of Artificial Neural Networks with Adaptive Sparse Connectivity inspired by Network Science\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation deep learning*\n\n*Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Madeleine Gibescu, Antonio Liotta, Phuong H. Nguyen, Elena Mocanu, Peter Stone*\n\n**Abstract:** Through the success of deep learning in various domains, artificial neural\nnetworks are currently among the most used artificial intelligence methods.\nTaking inspiration from the network properties of biological neural networks\n(e.g. sparsity, scale-freeness), we argue that (contrary to general practice)\nartificial neural networks, too, should not have fully-connected layers. Here\nwe propose sparse evolutionary training of artificial neural networks, an\nalgorithm which evolves an initial sparse topology (Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi random\ngraph) of two consecutive layers of neurons into a scale-free topology, during\nlearning. Our method replaces artificial neural networks fully-connected layers\nwith sparse ones before training, reducing quadratically the number of\nparameters, with no decrease in accuracy. We demonstrate our claims on\nrestricted Boltzmann machines, multi-layer perceptrons, and convolutional\nneural networks for unsupervised and supervised learning on 15 datasets.

Topological Insights into Sparse Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation deep learning*\n\n*Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Tim Van der Lee, Shiwei Liu, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Davide Ferraro, Anil Yaman, Zahra Atashgahi, Ghada Sokar*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse neural networks are effective approaches to reduce the resource requirements for the deployment of deep neural networks. Recently, the concept of adaptive sparse connectivity, has emerged to allow training sparse neural networks from scratch by optimizing the sparse structure during training. However, comparing different sparse topologies and determining how sparse topologies evolve during training, especially for the situation in which the sparse structure optimization is involved, remain as challenging open questions. This comparison becomes increasingly complex as the number of possible topological comparisons increases exponentially with the size of networks. In this work, we introduce an approach to understand and compare sparse neural network topologies from the perspective of graph theory. We first propose Neural Network Sparse Topology Distance (NNSTD) to measure the distance between different sparse neural networks. Further, we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can outperform over-parameterized models in terms of performance, even without any further structure optimization. To the end, we also show that adaptive sparse connectivity can always unveil a plenitude of sparse sub-networks with very different topologies which outperform the dense model, by quantifying and comparing their topological evolutionary processes. The latter findings complement the Lottery Ticket Hypothesis by showing that there is a much more efficient and robust way to find \"winning tickets\". Altogether, our results start enabling a better theoretical understanding of sparse neural networks, and demonstrate the utility of using graph theory to analyze them.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-24\n\n\n\n#### 5. Practical recommendations for gradient-based training of deep architectures\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient propagation*\n\n*Yoshua Bengio*\n\n**Abstract:** Learning algorithms related to artificial neural networks and in particular\nfor Deep Learning may seem to involve many bells and whistles, called\nhyper-parameters.

Gradient Flow of Energy: A General and Efficient Approach for Entity Alignment Decoding\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient propagation*\n\n*Jianxin Liao, Shaoling Sun, Qi Qi, Jingyu Wang, Haifeng Sun, Yuanyi Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Entity alignment (EA), a pivotal process in integrating multi-source Knowledge Graphs (KGs), seeks to identify equivalent entity pairs across these graphs. Most existing approaches regard EA as a graph representation learning task, concentrating on enhancing graph encoders. However, the decoding process in EA - essential for effective operation and alignment accuracy - has received limited attention and remains tailored to specific datasets and model architectures, necessitating both entity and additional explicit relation embeddings. This specificity limits its applicability, particularly in GNN-based models. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, generalized, and efficient decoding approach for EA, relying solely on entity embeddings. Our method optimizes the decoding process by minimizing Dirichlet energy, leading to the gradient flow within the graph, to maximize graph homophily. The discretization of the gradient flow produces a fast and scalable approach, termed Triple Feature Propagation (TFP). TFP innovatively generalizes adjacency matrices to multi-views matrices:entity-to-entity, entity-to-relation, relation-to-entity, and relation-to-triple. The gradient flow through generalized matrices enables TFP to harness the multi-view structural information of KGs. Rigorous experimentation on diverse public datasets demonstrates that our approach significantly enhances various EA methods. Notably, the approach achieves these advancements with less than 6 seconds of additional computational time, establishing a new benchmark in efficiency and adaptability for future EA methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on adaptive compression techniques, efficient sparse computation, and enhanced gradient propagation, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques for Neural Network States and Activations\n\n1. **Sparse Sinkhorn Attention**:\n   This method introduces a differentiable sorting mechanism that could be adapted for more efficient state management.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/32 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (Volume 1: Long Papers), pages 7275-7286, Dublin, Ireland, may 2022.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.76)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/67 (Score: 0.66)*\n\n```\nSIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 36(3):A1207-A1220, 2014.

Adaptive Proximal Gradient Methods for Structured Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive quantization neural networks*\n\n*Jihun Yun, A. Lozano, Eunho Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A general framework of stochastic proximal gradient descent meth-ods that allows for arbitrary positive preconditioners and lower semi-continuous regularizers and demonstrates the superiority of stochastic proximal methods compared to subgradient-based approaches via extensive experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider the training of structured neural networks where the regularizer can be non-smooth and possibly non-convex. While popular machine learning libraries have resorted to stochastic (adaptive) subgradient approaches, the use of proximal gradient methods in the stochastic setting has been little explored and warrants further study, in particular regarding the incorporation of adaptivity. Towards this goal, we present a general framework of stochastic proximal gradient descent meth-ods that allows for arbitrary positive preconditioners and lower semi-continuous regularizers. We derive two important instances of our framework: (i) the \ufb01rst proximal version of A DAM , one of the most popular adaptive SGD algorithm, and (ii) a revised version of P ROX Q UANT [1] for quantization-speci\ufb01c regularizers, which improves upon the original approach by incorporating the effect of preconditioners in the proximal mapping computations. We provide convergence guarantees for our framework and show that adaptive gradient methods can have faster convergence in terms of constant than vanilla SGD for sparse data. Lastly, we demonstrate the superiority of stochastic proximal methods compared to subgradient-based approaches via extensive experiments. Interestingly, our results indicate that the bene\ufb01t of proximal approaches over sub-gradient counterparts is more pronounced for non-convex regularizers than for convex ones.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. Up or Down? Adaptive Rounding for Post-Training Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive quantization neural networks*\n\n*Markus Nagel, Rana Ali Amjad, M. V.

We find that, perhaps surprisingly, this is not the best we can do. In this paper, we propose AdaRound, a better weight-rounding mechanism for post-training quantization that adapts to the data and the task loss. AdaRound is fast, does not require fine-tuning of the network, and only uses a small amount of unlabelled data. We start by theoretically analyzing the rounding problem for a pre-trained neural network. By approximating the task loss with a Taylor series expansion, the rounding task is posed as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem. We simplify this to a layer-wise local loss and propose to optimize this loss with a soft relaxation. AdaRound not only outperforms rounding-to-nearest by a significant margin but also establishes a new state-of-the-art for post-training quantization on several networks and tasks. Without fine-tuning, we can quantize the weights of Resnet18 and Resnet50 to 4 bits while staying within an accuracy loss of 1%.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 446  (*Influential: 74*)\n\n#### 4.

Gromicho*\n\n**TL;DR:** The EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition brought together the OR and ML communities as a joint effort of several previous competitions to solve a challenging VRP variant on real-world data provided by ORTEC, a leading provider of vehicle routing software.\n\n**Abstract:** Solving vehicle routing problems (VRPs) is an essential task for many industrial applications. Although VRPs have been traditionally studied in the operations research (OR) domain, they have lately been the subject of extensive work in the machine learning (ML) community. Both the OR and ML communities have begun to integrate ML into their meth-ods, but in vastly different ways. While the OR community primarily relies on simplistic ML methods, the ML community generally uses deep learning, but fails to outperform OR baselines. To address this gap, the EURO Meets NeurIPS 2022 Vehicle Routing Competition brought together the OR and ML communities as a joint effort of several previous competitions to solve a challenging VRP variant on real-world data provided by ORTEC, a leading provider of vehicle routing software. The challenge focuses on both a \u201cclassic\u201d deterministic VRP with time windows (VRPTW) and a dynamic version in which new orders arrive over the course of a day. Over 50 teams submitted solutions over a 13-week submission period, battling for not only the best performance on the competition problems, but also for the longest dominance of the leaderboard. The goals of the competition were achieved, with both state-of-the-art techniques in OR and ML playing a significant role in several of the winning submissions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. TESTAM: A Time-Enhanced Spatio-Temporal Attention Model with Mixture of Experts\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing deep learning*\n\n*Hyunwoo Lee, Sungahn Ko*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel deep learning model named TESTAM is proposed, which individually models recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns by a mixture-of-experts model with three experts on temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, and dynamic spatio-temporal dependency modeling with dynamic graph.\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate traffic forecasting is challenging due to the complex dependency on road networks, various types of roads, and the abrupt speed change due to the events. Recent works mainly focus on dynamic spatial modeling with adaptive graph embedding or graph attention having less consideration for temporal characteristics and in-situ modeling. In this paper, we propose a novel deep learning model named TESTAM, which individually models recurring and non-recurring traffic patterns by a mixture-of-experts model with three experts on temporal modeling, spatio-temporal modeling with static graph, and dynamic spatio-temporal dependency modeling with dynamic graph. By introducing different experts and properly routing them, TESTAM could better model various circumstances, including spatially isolated nodes, highly related nodes, and recurring and non-recurring events. For the proper routing, we reformulate a gating problem into a classification problem with pseudo labels. Experimental results on three public traffic network datasets, METR-LA, PEMS-BAY, and EXPY-TKY, demonstrate that TESTAM achieves a better indication and modeling of recurring and non-recurring traffic.

Investigating Capsule Network and Semantic Feature on Hyperplanes for Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing deep learning*\n\n*Chunning Du, Haifeng Sun, Jingyu Wang, Q. Qi, J. Liao, Chun Wang, Bing Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel dynamic routing mechanism named \u2018routing-on-hyperplane\u2019 will select the proper sense for the downstream classification task and the experimental results show that the model is capable of extracting more discriminative semantic features and yields a significant performance gain compared to other baseline methods.\n\n**Abstract:** As an essential component of natural language processing, text classification relies on deep learning in recent years. Various neural networks are designed for text classification on the basis of word embedding. However, polysemy is a fundamental feature of the natural language, which brings challenges to text classification. One polysemic word contains more than one sense, while the word embedding procedure conflates different senses of a polysemic word into a single vector. Extracting the distinct representation for the specific sense could thus lead to fine-grained models with strong generalization ability. It has been demonstrated that multiple senses of a word actually reside in linear superposition within the word embedding so that specific senses can be extracted from the original word embedding. Therefore, we propose to use capsule networks to construct the vectorized representation of semantics and utilize hyperplanes to decompose each capsule to acquire the specific senses. A novel dynamic routing mechanism named \u2018routing-on-hyperplane\u2019 will select the proper sense for the downstream classification task. Our model is evaluated on 6 different datasets, and the experimental results show that our model is capable of extracting more discriminative semantic features and yields a significant performance gain compared to other baseline methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Efficient Neural Network Training via Forward and Backward Propagation Sparsification\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation sparse networks*\n\n*Xiao Zhou, Weizhong Zhang, Zonghao Chen, Shizhe Diao, Tong Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes an efficient sparse training method with completely sparse forward and backward passes, and proposes a variance reduced policy gradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward propagation, thus achieving completely sparse training.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse training is a natural idea to accelerate the training speed of deep neural networks and save the memory usage, especially since large modern neural networks are significantly over-parameterized. However, most of the existing methods cannot achieve this goal in practice because the chain rule based gradient (w.r.t. structure parameters) estimators adopted by previous methods require dense computation at least in the backward propagation step. This paper solves this problem by proposing an efficient sparse training method with completely sparse forward and backward passes. We first formulate the training process as a continuous minimization problem under global sparsity constraint. We then separate the optimization process into two steps, corresponding to weight update and structure parameter update. For the former step, we use the conventional chain rule, which can be sparse via exploiting the sparse structure. For the latter step, instead of using the chain rule based gradient estimators as in existing methods, we propose a variance reduced policy gradient estimator, which only requires two forward passes without backward propagation, thus achieving completely sparse training. We prove that the variance of our gradient estimator is bounded. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that compared to previous methods, our algorithm is much more effective in accelerating the training process, up to an order of magnitude faster.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. AdaBits: Neural Network Quantization with Adaptive Bit-Widths\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive quantization neural networks*\n\n*Zhenyu Liao, Linjie Yang, Qing Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks with adaptive configurations have gained increasing attention due to the instant and flexible deployment of these models on platforms with different resource budgets. In this paper, we investigate a novel option to achieve this goal by enabling adaptive bit-widths of weights and activations in the model. We first examine the benefits and challenges of training quantized model with adaptive bit-widths, and then experiment with several approaches including direct adaptation, progressive training and joint training. We discover that joint training is able to produce comparable performance on the adaptive model as individual models. We further propose a new technique named Switchable Clipping Level (S-CL) to further improve quantized models at the lowest bit-width. With our proposed techniques applied on a bunch of models including MobileNet-V1/V2 and ResNet-50, we demonstrate that bit-width of weights and activations is a new option for adaptively executable deep neural networks, offering a distinct opportunity for improved accuracy-efficiency trade-off as well as instant adaptation according to the platform constraints in real-world applications.\n\n**Conference:** adabits-neural-network-quantization-with-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. ANT: Exploiting Adaptive Numerical Data Type for Low-bit Deep Neural Network Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive quantization neural networks*\n\n*Yuhao Zhu, Minyi Guo, Yunxin Liu, Fan Yang, Zihan Liu, Jingwen Leng, Chen Zhang, Cong Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a technique to reduce the computation and memory cost of DNN models, which are getting increasingly large. Existing quantization solutions use fixed-point integer or floating-point types, which have limited benefits, as both require more bits to maintain the accuracy of original models. On the other hand, variable-length quantization uses low-bit quantization for normal values and high-precision for a fraction of outlier values. Even though this line of work brings algorithmic benefits, it also introduces significant hardware overheads due to variable-length encoding and decoding. In this work, we propose a fixed-length adaptive numerical data type called ANT to achieve low-bit quantization with tiny hardware overheads. Our data type ANT leverages two key innovations to exploit the intra-tensor and inter-tensor adaptive opportunities in DNN models. First, we propose a particular data type, flint, that combines the advantages of float and int for adapting to the importance of different values within a tensor. Second, we propose an adaptive framework that selects the best type for each tensor according to its distribution characteristics. We design a unified processing element architecture for ANT and show its ease of integration with existing DNN accelerators. Our design results in 2.8$\\times$ speedup and 2.5$\\times$ energy efficiency improvement over the state-of-the-art quantization accelerators.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Deep Reinforcement Learning Algorithm Using Dynamic Attention Model for Vehicle Routing Problems\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic routing deep learning*\n\n*Bo Peng, Zizhen Zhang, Jiahai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent researches show that machine learning has the potential to learn better heuristics than the one designed by human for solving combinatorial optimization problems. The deep neural network is used to characterize the input instance for constructing a feasible solution incrementally. Recently, an attention model is proposed to solve routing problems. In this model, the state of an instance is represented by node features that are fixed over time. However, the fact is, the state of an instance is changed according to the decision that the model made at different construction steps, and the node features should be updated correspondingly. Therefore, this paper presents a dynamic attention model with dynamic encoder-decoder architecture, which enables the model to explore node features dynamically and exploit hidden structure information effectively at different construction steps. This paper focuses on a challenging NP-hard problem, vehicle routing problem. The experiments indicate that our model outperforms the previous methods and also shows a good generalization performance.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-09\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Recently, new efforts have emerged to create constructive and perturbative heuristics to tackle this problem using Deep Learning. In this paper, we join these efforts to develop the Combined Deep Constructor and Perturbator, which combines two powerful constructive and perturbative Deep Learning-based heuristics, using attention mechanisms at their core. Furthermore, we improve the Attention Model-Dynamic for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem by proposing a memory-efficient algorithm that reduces its memory complexity by a factor of the number of nodes. Our method shows promising results. It demonstrates a cost improvement in common datasets when compared against other multiple Deep Learning methods. It also obtains close results to the state-of-the art heuristics from the Operations Research field. Additionally, the proposed memory efficient algorithm for the Attention Model-Dynamic model enables its use in problem instances with more than 100 nodes.\n\n**Published:** 2022-11-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. The Tree Ensemble Layer: Differentiability meets Conditional Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation sparse networks*\n\n*Natalia Ponomareva, Rahul Mazumder, Petros Mol, Zhenyu Tan, Hussein Hazimeh*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks and tree ensembles are state-of-the-art learners, each with its unique statistical and computational advantages. We aim to combine these advantages by introducing a new layer for neural networks, composed of an ensemble of differentiable decision trees (a.k.a. soft trees). While differentiable trees demonstrate promising results in the literature, they are typically slow in training and inference as they do not support conditional computation. We mitigate this issue by introducing a new sparse activation function for sample routing, and implement true conditional computation by developing specialized forward and backward propagation algorithms that exploit sparsity. Our efficient algorithms pave the way for jointly training over deep and wide tree ensembles using first-order methods (e.g., SGD). Experiments on 23 classification datasets indicate over 10x speed-ups compared to the differentiable trees used in the literature and over 20x reduction in the number of parameters compared to gradient boosted trees, while maintaining competitive performance. Moreover, experiments on CIFAR, MNIST, and Fashion MNIST indicate that replacing dense layers in CNNs with our tree layer reduces the test loss by 7-53% and the number of parameters by 8x. We provide an open-source TensorFlow implementation with a Keras API.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-18\n\n\n\n#### 6. $S^3$: Sign-Sparse-Shift Reparametrization for Effective Training of Low-bit Shift Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation sparse networks*\n\n*Vahid Partovi Nia, Chunjing Xu, Wulong Liu, YaoLiang Yu, Bang Liu, Xinlin Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Shift neural networks reduce computation complexity by removing expensive multiplication operations and quantizing continuous weights into low-bit discrete values, which are fast and energy efficient compared to conventional neural networks. However, existing shift networks are sensitive to the weight initialization, and also yield a degraded performance caused by vanishing gradient and weight sign freezing problem. To address these issues, we propose S low-bit re-parameterization, a novel technique for training low-bit shift networks. Our method decomposes a discrete parameter in a sign-sparse-shift 3-fold manner. In this way, it efficiently learns a low-bit network with a weight dynamics similar to full-precision networks and insensitive to weight initialization. Our proposed training method pushes the boundaries of shift neural networks and shows 3-bit shift networks out-performs their full-precision counterparts in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\n**Conference:** s-3-sign-sparse-shift-reparametrization-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on adaptive quantization, dynamic routing, and efficient gradient propagation is crucial. Here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n### Adaptive Quantization and Compression Techniques\n\n1. **Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) Methods**:\n   - Papers like \"Understanding the difficulty of low-precision post-training quantization\" discuss methods such as quantization-aware fine-tuning (QAFT) and layer-wise local error minimization. QAFT is particularly effective in reducing global loss and improving the generalization capability of quantized models, even with low-precision formats.\n   - The \"FlatQuant\" approach enhances the flatness of weights and activations, which can be beneficial for post-training quantization of large language models (LLMs).\n\n2. **Quantization of Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - The \"SageAttention\" method addresses the challenges of quantizing attention mechanisms, which are critical in transformer-based models.

This dynamic activation pattern can be adapted for more efficient state management in autoregressive models[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Latent Attention Mechanisms**:\n   - Methods like \"Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers\" reduce the time complexity of standard attention mechanisms by defining attention via latent vectors. This can be combined with adaptive compression techniques to enhance efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n3. **DuoAttention Framework**:\n   - The \"DuoAttention\" framework selectively applies full KV cache to retrieval heads while using a lightweight, constant-length KV cache for streaming heads. This approach reduces memory and latency without compromising long-context abilities, which is relevant for dynamic routing and selective computation.\n\n### Techniques for Efficient Gradient Computation and Propagation in Sparse Architectures\n\n1. **Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Estimator**:\n   - The method proposed in \"Efficient Neural Network Training via Forward and Backward Propagation Sparsification\" achieves sparse training by using a variance reduced policy gradient estimator that requires only two forward passes without backward propagation. This can improve training stability and efficiency in sparse settings[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Quantization-Aware Fine-Tuning (QAFT)**:\n   - QAFT involves gradient updates to optimize the global training loss, which is crucial for maintaining stable gradient propagation in complex and sparse architectures. Even a few iterations of QAFT can significantly improve the generalization capability of quantized models.\n\n3. **Sparse Neural Network Training**:\n   - Techniques that focus on efficient backpropagation in sparse settings, such as those discussed in the context of sparse neural networks, can be adapted to improve the training efficiency of autoregressive language models. These methods often involve minimizing local errors while ensuring global loss reduction.\n\nBy integrating these adaptive quantization, dynamic routing, and efficient gradient propagation techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models that balance expressiveness with computational efficiency.\n",

We introduce a method to reduce this to linear scaling with time, based on defining attention via latent vectors. The method is readily usable as a drop-in replacement for the standard attention mechanism. Our\"Latte Transformer\"model can be implemented for both bidirectional and unidirectional tasks, with the causal version allowing a recurrent implementation which is memory and time-efficient during inference of language generation tasks. Whilst next token prediction scales linearly with the sequence length for a standard transformer, a Latte Transformer requires constant time to compute the next token. The empirical performance of our method is comparable to standard attention, yet allows scaling to context windows much larger than practical in standard attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/21 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Despite its effectiveness, self-attention suffers from quadratic computation and memory requirements with respect to sequence length. Successful approaches to reduce this complexity focused on attending to local sliding windows or a small set of locations independent of content. Our work proposes to learn dynamic sparse attention patterns that avoid allocating computation and memory to attend to content unrelated to the query of interest. This work builds upon two lines of research: It combines the modeling flexibility of prior work on content-based sparse attention with the efficiency gains from approaches based on local, temporal sparse attention. Our model, the Routing Transformer, endows self-attention with a sparse routing module based on online k-means while reducing the overall complexity of attention to O(n1.5d) from O(n2d) for sequence length n and hidden dimension d. We show that our model outperforms comparable sparse attention models on language modeling on Wikitext-103 (15.8 vs 18.3 perplexity), as well as on image generation on ImageNet-64 (3.43 vs 3.44 bits/dim) while using fewer self-attention layers.

In the context of speech recognition, Jaitly et al. (2016) proposed the Neural Transducer which segments sequences in non-overlapping chunks and attention is performed in each chunk independently. Limiting attention to a fixed temporal context around the current prediction has also been explored in Chorowski et al. (2015), while ? dynamically segment the sequence into variable sized-chunks. Hierarchical attention strategies have also been explored: the model first considers which part of the inputs should be attended to before computing full attention in a contiguous neighborhood of the selected area (Gregor et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015). Later, hierarchical attention has been simplified by Liu et al. (2018) that alternates coarse layers (attending to the whole sequence at a lower temporal resolution) with local layers (attending to a neighborhood of the current prediction). This alternating strategy is also employed by Child et al. (2019), which introduces bounded and strided attention, i.e. attending to a fixed context in the past at a sub-sampled temporal resolution. This work formalizes such a strategy using a sparse attention formalism, showing how it relates to full attention with a specific sparsity pattern in the attention matrix. It shows that sparse attention is sufficient to get state-of-the-art results in modeling long sequences over language modeling, image generation and music generation. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) build upon this work and show that is it is possible to obtain further sparsity by letting the model learn the length of the temporal context for each attention module. This work also makes use of the attention cache introduced in Dai et al. (2019), a memory mechanism to train models over temporal contexts which extend beyond the length of the training batches. Attention with Content-Based Sparsity: The above work mainly relies on two efficient ideas: attending to less elements by only considering a fixed bounded local context in the past, and attending to less elements by decreasing the temporal resolution of context. These ideas do not allow arbitrary sparsity patterns in attention matrices. Content-based sparse attention has been introduced to allow for richer patterns and more expressive models. Martins and Kreutzer (2017); Malaviya et al. (2018) propose to compute attention weights with variants of sparsemax. Correia et al. (2019) generalizes this approach to every layer in a Transformer using entmax which allows for more efficient inference. This line of work allows for learning arbitrary sparsity attention patterns from data, based\non the content of the current query and past context. However, sparsity here cannot be leveraged to improve space and time complexity since sparse$\\max /$ entmax formulations require instantiating the full attention matrix prior to sparsification. This is a drawback compared to temporal sparsity approaches. Our work is motivated by bridging this gap and allows for arbitrary sparsity patterns while avoiding having to instantiate non-zero entries of attention matrices. Contemporaneous to our work, Kitaev et al. (2020) proposed to use Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) using random hyper-planes to infer content based sparsity patterns for attention: tokens that fall into the same hash bucket, get to attend to each other. While similar in spirit to our approach, the approach of Kitaev et al. (2020) keeps the randomly initialized hyper-planes fixed throughout, while we use mini-batch spherical $k$-means to learn the space-partitioning centroids. The motivation in both approaches is to approximate Maximum Inner Product Search (MIPS) in the context of dot product attention, for which both LSH and spherical $k$-means have been used in literature. However, typically spherical $k$-means is known to outperform LSH for MIPS (see e.g.\n```\n\n#### 5. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.48)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Recently, many BERT-based models have been introduced for the task. While these models have achieved competitive results on many datasets, they are computationally expensive and contain about 110M parameters. Little is known about the factors contributing to their impressive performance and whether the over-parameterization is needed. In this work, we shed some light on the inner working mechanisms of these large BERT-based models. Through a set of probing experiments, we have found that the entity linking performance only changes slightly when the input word order is shuffled or when the attention scope is limited to a fixed window size. From these observations, we propose an efficient convolutional neural network with residual connections for biomedical entity linking. Because of the sparse connectivity and weight sharing properties, our model has a small number of parameters and is highly efficient. On five public datasets, our model achieves comparable or even better linking accuracy than the state-of-the-art BERT-based models while having about 60 times fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 3. Self-Attention with Relative Position Representations\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Peter Shaw, Jakob Uszkoreit, Ashish Vaswani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements, on the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English- to-French translation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Relying entirely on an attention mechanism, the Transformer introduced by Vaswani et al. (2017) achieves state-of-the-art results for machine translation. In contrast to recurrent and convolutional neural networks, it does not explicitly model relative or absolute position information in its structure. Instead, it requires adding representations of absolute positions to its inputs. In this work we present an alternative approach, extending the self-attention mechanism to efficiently consider representations of the relative positions, or distances between sequence elements. On the WMT 2014 English-to-German and English-to-French translation tasks, this approach yields improvements of 1.3 BLEU and 0.3 BLEU over absolute position representations, respectively. Notably, we observe that combining relative and absolute position representations yields no further improvement in translation quality. We describe an efficient implementation of our method and cast it as an instance of relation-aware self-attention mechanisms that can generalize to arbitrary graph-labeled inputs.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 2072  (*Influential: 225*)\n\n#### 4. Test-Time Training on Nearest Neighbors for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation test-time training*\n\n*Moritz Hardt, Yu Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling by building a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset and fine-tunes the model on retrieved data at test time.\n\n**Abstract:** Many recent efforts augment language models with retrieval, by adding retrieved data to the input context. For this approach to succeed, the retrieved data must be added at both training and test time. Moreover, as input length grows linearly with the size of retrieved data, cost in computation and memory grows quadratically for modern Transformers. To avoid these complications, we simply fine-tune the model on retrieved data at test time, using its standard training setup. We build a large-scale distributed index based on text embeddings of the Pile dataset. For each test input, our system retrieves its neighbors and fine-tunes the model on their text. Surprisingly, retrieving and training on as few as 20 neighbors, each for only one gradient iteration, drastically improves performance across more than 20 language modeling tasks in the Pile. For example, test-time training with nearest neighbors significantly narrows the performance gap between a small GPT-2 and a GPT-Neo model more than 10 times larger. Sufficient index quality and size, however, are necessary. Our work establishes a first baseline of test-time training for language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An active sample selection criterion is proposed to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation, and a Fisher regularizer is introduced to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 223  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n#### 6.

Domain generalization (DG) has become one of the key topics in various fields. Several literatures show that DG can be arbitrarily hard without exploiting target domain information. To address this issue, test-time adaptive (TTA) methods are proposed. Existing TTA methods require offline target data or extra sophisticated optimization procedures during the inference stage. In this work, we adopt Non-Parametric Classifier to perform the test-time Adaptation (AdaNPC). In particular, we construct a memory that contains the feature and label pairs from training domains. During inference, given a test instance, AdaNPC first recalls K closed samples from the memory to vote for the prediction, and then the test feature and predicted label are added to the memory. In this way, the sample distribution in the memory can be gradually changed from the training distribution towards the test distribution with very little extra computation cost. We theoretically justify the rationality behind the proposed method. Besides, we test our model on extensive numerical experiments. AdaNPC significantly outperforms competitive baselines on various DG benchmarks. In particular, when the adaptation target is a series of domains, the adaptation accuracy of AdaNPC is 50% higher than advanced TTA methods.

Chawla, Chuxu Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel method GAME Graph Adversarial Mixture of Experts to enlarge model capacity and enrich the representation diversity of adversarial samples, from three perspectives of model, training, and optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art results on a variety of graph learning tasks, however, it has been demonstrated that they are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, raising serious security concerns. A lot of studies have been developed to train GNNs in a noisy environment and increase their robustness against adversarial attacks. However, existing methods have not uncovered a principled difficulty: the convoluted mixture distribution between clean and attacked data samples, which leads to sub-optimal model design and limits their frameworks\u2019 robustness. In this work, we first begin by identifying the root cause of mixture distribution, then, for tackling it, we propose a novel method GAME Graph Adversarial Mixture of Experts to enlarge model capacity and enrich the representation diversity of adversarial samples, from three perspectives of model, training, and optimization. Specifically, we first propose a plug-and-play GAME layer that can be easily incorporated into any GNNs and enhance their adversarial learning capabilities. Second, we design a decoupling-based graph adversarial training in which the component of the model used to generate adversarial graphs is separated from the component used to update weights. Third, we introduce a graph diversity regularization that enables the model to learn diverse representation and further improves model performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of GAME over the state-of-the-art adversarial training methods across various datasets given different attacks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Design-Bench: Benchmarks for Data-Driven Offline Model-Based Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: model capacity optimization*\n\n*Brandon Trabucco, Xinyang Geng, Aviral Kumar, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents Design-Bench, a benchmark for offline MBO with a unified evaluation protocol and reference implementations of recent methods, which includes a suite of diverse and realistic tasks derived from real-world optimization problems in biology, materials science, and robotics that present distinct challenges forOffline MBO.\n\n**Abstract:** Black-box model-based optimization (MBO) problems, where the goal is to find a design input that maximizes an unknown objective function, are ubiquitous in a wide range of domains, such as the design of proteins, DNA sequences, aircraft, and robots. Solving model-based optimization problems typically requires actively querying the unknown objective function on design proposals, which means physically building the candidate molecule, aircraft, or robot, testing it, and storing the result. This process can be expensive and time consuming, and one might instead prefer to optimize for the best design using only the data one already has. This setting -- called offline MBO -- poses substantial and different algorithmic challenges than more commonly studied online techniques. A number of recent works have demonstrated success with offline MBO for high-dimensional optimization problems using high-capacity deep neural networks. However, the lack of standardized benchmarks in this emerging field is making progress difficult to track. To address this, we present Design-Bench, a benchmark for offline MBO with a unified evaluation protocol and reference implementations of recent methods. Our benchmark includes a suite of diverse and realistic tasks derived from real-world optimization problems in biology, materials science, and robotics that present distinct challenges for offline MBO.

Offline Model-Based Optimization via Normalized Maximum Likelihood Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: model capacity optimization*\n\n*Justin Fu, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to tackle data-driven optimization problems where one must maximize a function given only queries at a fixed set of points by leveraging the normalized maximum-likelihood (NML) estimator, which provides a principled approach to handling uncertainty and out-of-distribution inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work we consider data-driven optimization problems where one must maximize a function given only queries at a fixed set of points. This problem setting emerges in many domains where function evaluation is a complex and expensive process, such as in the design of materials, vehicles, or neural network architectures. Because the available data typically only covers a small manifold of the possible space of inputs, a principal challenge is to be able to construct algorithms that can reason about uncertainty and out-of-distribution values, since a naive optimizer can easily exploit an estimated model to return adversarial inputs. We propose to tackle this problem by leveraging the normalized maximum-likelihood (NML) estimator, which provides a principled approach to handling uncertainty and out-of-distribution inputs. While in the standard formulation NML is intractable, we propose a tractable approximation that allows us to scale our method to high-capacity neural network models. We demonstrate that our method can effectively optimize high-dimensional design problems in a variety of disciplines such as chemistry, biology, and materials engineering.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DRAGNN: A Transition-based Framework for Dynamically Connected Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Ivan Bogatyy, Lingpeng Kong, David Weiss, Chris Alberti, Daniel Andor*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we present a compact, modular framework for constructing novel\nrecurrent neural architectures. Our basic module is a new generic unit, the\nTransition Based Recurrent Unit (TBRU). In addition to hidden layer\nactivations, TBRUs have discrete state dynamics that allow network connections\nto be built dynamically as a function of intermediate activations. By\nconnecting multiple TBRUs, we can extend and combine commonly used\narchitectures such as sequence-to-sequence, attention mechanisms, and\nre-cursive tree-structured models. A TBRU can also serve as both an encoder for\ndownstream tasks and as a decoder for its own task simultaneously, resulting in\nmore accurate multi-task learning. We call our approach Dynamic Recurrent\nAcyclic Graphical Neural Networks, or DRAGNN. We show that DRAGNN is\nsignificantly more accurate and efficient than seq2seq with attention for\nsyntactic dependency parsing and yields more accurate multi-task learning for\nextractive summarization tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-13\n\n\n\n#### 2. Co-Scale Conv-Attentional Image Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Zhuowen Tu, Tyler Chang, Yifan Xu, Weijian Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we present Co-scale conv-attentional image Transformers (CoaT), a Transformer-based image classifier equipped with co-scale and conv-attentional mechanisms. First, the co-scale mechanism maintains the integrity of Transformers' encoder branches at individual scales, while allowing representations learned at different scales to effectively communicate with each other; we design a series of serial and parallel blocks to realize the co-scale mechanism. Second, we devise a conv-attentional mechanism by realizing a relative position embedding formulation in the factorized attention module with an efficient convolution-like implementation. CoaT empowers image Transformers with enriched multi-scale and contextual modeling capabilities. On ImageNet, relatively small CoaT models attain superior classification results compared with similar-sized convolutional neural networks and image/vision Transformers. The effectiveness of CoaT's backbone is also illustrated on object detection and instance segmentation, demonstrating its applicability to downstream computer vision tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-13\n\n\n\n#### 3.

In Computer Vision, however, almost all performant networks are \"dense\", that is, every input is processed by every parameter. We present a Vision MoE (V-MoE), a sparse version of the Vision Transformer, that is scalable and competitive with the largest dense networks. When applied to image recognition, V-MoE matches the performance of state-of-the-art networks, while requiring as little as half of the compute at inference time. Further, we propose an extension to the routing algorithm that can prioritize subsets of each input across the entire batch, leading to adaptive per-image compute. This allows V-MoE to trade-off performance and compute smoothly at test-time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of V-MoE to scale vision models, and train a 15B parameter model that attains 90.35% on ImageNet.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-10\n\n\n\n#### 4. Quick and Robust Feature Selection: the Strength of Energy-efficient Sparse Training for Autoencoders\n\n*From Search Query: sparse computation test-time training*\n\n*Mykola Pechenizkiy, Raymond Veldhuis, Decebal Constantin Mocanu, Elena Mocanu, Tim Van der Lee, Ghada Sokar, Zahra Atashgahi*\n\n**Abstract:** Major complications arise from the recent increase in the amount of high-dimensional data, including high computational costs and memory requirements. Feature selection, which identifies the most relevant and informative attributes of a dataset, has been introduced as a solution to this problem. Most of the existing feature selection methods are computationally inefficient; inefficient algorithms lead to high energy consumption, which is not desirable for devices with limited computational and energy resources. In this paper, a novel and flexible method for unsupervised feature selection is proposed. This method, named QuickSelection, introduces the strength of the neuron in sparse neural networks as a criterion to measure the feature importance. This criterion, blended with sparsely connected denoising autoencoders trained with the sparse evolutionary training procedure, derives the importance of all input features simultaneously. We implement QuickSelection in a purely sparse manner as opposed to the typical approach of using a binary mask over connections to simulate sparsity. It results in a considerable speed increase and memory reduction. When tested on several benchmark datasets, including five low-dimensional and three high-dimensional datasets, the proposed method is able to achieve the best trade-off of classification and clustering accuracy, running time, and maximum memory usage, among widely used approaches for feature selection. Besides, our proposed method requires the least amount of energy among the state-of-the-art autoencoder-based feature selection methods.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Network learning via multi-agent inverse transportation problems\n\n*From Search Query: model capacity optimization*\n\n*Susan Jia Xu, Mehdi Nourinejad, Xuebo Lai, Joseph Y. J. Chow*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the ubiquity of transportation data, methods to infer the state\nparameters of a network either ignore sensitivity of route decisions, require\nroute enumeration for parameterizing descriptive models of route selection, or\nrequire complex bilevel models of route assignment behavior. These limitations\nprevent modelers from fully exploiting ubiquitous data in monitoring\ntransportation networks. Inverse optimization methods that capture network\nroute choice behavior can address this gap, but they are designed to take\nobservations of the same model to learn the parameters of that model, which is\nstatistically inefficient (e.g. requires estimating population route and link\nflows). New inverse optimization models and supporting algorithms are proposed\nto learn the parameters of heterogeneous travelers' route behavior to infer\nshared network state parameters (e.g. link capacity dual prices). The inferred\nvalues are consistent with observations of each agent's optimization behavior.\nWe prove that the method can obtain unique dual prices for a network shared by\nthese agents in polynomial time. Four experiments are conducted. The first one,\nconducted on a 4-node network, verifies the methodology to obtain heterogeneous\nlink cost parameters even when multinomial or mixed logit models would not be\nmeaningfully estimated. The second is a parameter recovery test on the\nNguyen-Dupuis network that shows that unique latent link capacity dual prices\ncan be inferred using the proposed method. The third test on the same network\ndemonstrates how a monitoring system in an online learning environment can be\ndesigned using this method. The last test demonstrates this learning on real\ndata obtained from a freeway network in Queens, New York, using only real-time\nGoogle Maps queries.\n\n**Published:** 2016-09-14\n\n\n\n#### 6. Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: model capacity optimization*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient attention mechanisms, integrating sparse computation with test-time training, and optimizing model capacity and computational efficiency, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n- Implementing sparse attention can significantly reduce computational complexity.

This mechanism can be integrated with test-time training to adaptively adjust the model's computation based on the input, enhancing efficiency[Analysis Note, \"Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling\"].\n\n### Variance Reduced Policy Gradient Estimator\n- This technique involves sparse training methods that only require two forward passes without backward propagation, achieving completely sparse training. This can be combined with test-time training to optimize the model's performance and efficiency during deployment[Analysis Note, \"Efficient Neural Network Training via Forward and Backward Propagation Sparsification\"].\n\n## Optimizing Model Capacity and Computational Efficiency Trade-offs\n\n### Quantization and Compression Techniques\n- Post-training quantization methods, such as AdaRound, can reduce memory requirements without significant performance loss. Adaptive compression techniques and quantization-aware attention mechanisms can further optimize model capacity while maintaining performance[Analysis Note, \"Up or Down? Adaptive Rounding for Post-Training Quantization\"].\n\n### Dynamic Computation Patterns\n- Techniques like latent attention mechanisms offer linear-time alternatives to standard attention, and dynamic routing strategies can improve efficiency by selectively activating components. These methods can help balance model capacity with computational efficiency[Analysis Note, \"Latent Attention for Linear Time Transformers\"].\n\n### Efficient Architectures\n- Exploring alternative architectures such as Linformer or Performer can reduce the complexity of self-attention. These models are designed to handle long sequences more efficiently, which is crucial for optimizing model capacity and computational efficiency.\n\nBy incorporating these advancements, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable autoregressive language models that maintain high performance while reducing computational complexity and memory requirements.\n",

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.56)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 12 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: hardware efficient linear attention, parameter sharing neural networks, adaptive regularization deep learning\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear attention*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Various Lengths, Constant Speed: Efficient Language Modeling with Lightning Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear attention*\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention is presented, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption and TransNormerLLM (TNL) is introduced, a new architecture that is tailored to the authors' lightning attention.\n\n**Abstract:** We present Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that maintains a constant training speed for various sequence lengths under fixed memory consumption. Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Revisiting Parameter Sharing for Automatic Neural Channel Number Search\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing neural networks*\n\n*Jiaxing Wang, Haoli Bai, Jiaxiang Wu, Xupeng Shi, Junzhou Huang, Irwin King, Michael R. Lyu, Jian Cheng*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy of parameter sharing is proposed as a general formulation to unify and quantitatively analyze existing channel search algorithms and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed strategy in channel con\ufb01guration against many state-of-the-art counterparts on benchmark datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in neural architecture search inspire many channel number search algorithms (CNS) for convolutional neural networks. To improve searching ef-\ufb01ciency, parameter sharing is widely applied, which reuses parameters among different channel con\ufb01gurations. Nevertheless, it is unclear how parameter sharing affects the searching process. In this paper, we aim at providing a better understanding and exploitation of parameter sharing for CNS. Speci\ufb01cally, we propose af\ufb01ne parameter sharing (APS) as a general formulation to unify and quantitatively analyze existing channel search algorithms. It is found that with parameter sharing, weight updates of one architecture can simultaneously bene\ufb01t other candidates. However, it also results in less con\ufb01dence in choosing good architectures. We thus propose a new strategy of parameter sharing towards a better balance between training ef\ufb01ciency and architecture discrimination.

Deeply Shared Filter Bases for Parameter-Efficient Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing neural networks*\n\n*Woochul Kang, Daeyeon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a recursive convolution block design and training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradients problem during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have massive identical convolution blocks, and, hence, recursive sharing of parameters across these blocks has been proposed to reduce the amount of parameters. However, naive sharing of parameters poses many challenges such as limited representational power and the vanishing/exploding gradients problem of recursively shared parameters. In this paper, we present a recursive convolution block design and training method, in which a recursively shareable part, or a filter basis, is separated and learned while effectively avoiding the vanishing/exploding gradients problem during training. We show that the unwieldy vanishing/exploding gradients problem can be controlled by enforcing the elements of the filter basis orthonormal, and empirically demonstrate that the proposed orthogonality regularization improves the flow of gradients during training. Experimental results on image classification and object detection show that our approach, unlike previous parameter-sharing approaches, does not trade performance to save parameters and consistently outperforms overparameterized counterpart networks. This superior performance demonstrates that the proposed recursive convolution block design and the orthogonality regularization not only prevent performance degradation, but also consistently improve the representation capability while a significant amount of parameters are recursively shared.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Deep Learning meets Nonparametric Regression: Are Weight-Decayed DNNs Locally Adaptive?\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive regularization deep learning*\n\n*Kaiqi Zhang, Yu-Xiang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is established that by tuning only the regularization factor, such parallel NN achieves an estimation error arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and BV classes.\n\n**Abstract:** We study the theory of neural network (NN) from the lens of classical nonparametric regression problems with a focus on NN's ability to adaptively estimate functions with heterogeneous smoothness -- a property of functions in Besov or Bounded Variation (BV) classes. Existing work on this problem requires tuning the NN architecture based on the function spaces and sample size. We consider a\"Parallel NN\"variant of deep ReLU networks and show that the standard $\\ell_2$ regularization is equivalent to promoting the $\\ell_p$-sparsity ($0<p<1$) in the coefficient vector of an end-to-end learned function bases, i.e., a dictionary. Using this equivalence, we further establish that by tuning only the regularization factor, such parallel NN achieves an estimation error arbitrarily close to the minimax rates for both the Besov and BV classes. Notably, it gets exponentially closer to minimax optimal as the NN gets deeper. Our research sheds new lights on why depth matters and how NNs are more powerful than kernel methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Combining Explicit and Implicit Regularization for Efficient Learning in Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive regularization deep learning*\n\n*Dan Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes an explicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with certain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam) and suggests that explicit regularization can play a role in designing different, desirable forms of regularization and that a more nuanced understanding of this interplay may be necessary.\n\n**Abstract:** Works on implicit regularization have studied gradient trajectories during the optimization process to explain why deep networks favor certain kinds of solutions over others. In deep linear networks, it has been shown that gradient descent implicitly regularizes toward low-rank solutions on matrix completion/factorization tasks. Adding depth not only improves performance on these tasks but also acts as an accelerative pre-conditioning that further enhances this bias towards low-rankedness. Inspired by this, we propose an explicit penalty to mirror this implicit bias which only takes effect with certain adaptive gradient optimizers (e.g. Adam). This combination can enable a degenerate single-layer network to achieve low-rank approximations with generalization error comparable to deep linear networks, making depth no longer necessary for learning. The single-layer network also performs competitively or out-performs various approaches for matrix completion over a range of parameter and data regimes despite its simplicity. Together with an optimizer's inductive bias, our findings suggest that explicit regularization can play a role in designing different, desirable forms of regularization and that a more nuanced understanding of this interplay may be necessary.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. EfficientViT: Multi-Scale Linear Attention for High-Resolution Dense Prediction\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear attention*\n\n*Chuang Gan, Junyan Li, Muyan Hu, Song Han, Han Cai*\n\n**Abstract:** High-resolution dense prediction enables many appealing real-world applications, such as computational photography, autonomous driving, etc. However, the vast computational cost makes deploying state-of-the-art high-resolution dense prediction models on hardware devices difficult. This work presents EfficientViT, a new family of high-resolution vision models with novel multi-scale linear attention. Unlike prior high-resolution dense prediction models that rely on heavy softmax attention, hardware-inefficient large-kernel convolution, or complicated topology structure to obtain good performances, our multi-scale linear attention achieves the global receptive field and multi-scale learning (two desirable features for high-resolution dense prediction) with only lightweight and hardware-efficient operations. As such, EfficientViT delivers remarkable performance gains over previous state-of-the-art models with significant speedup on diverse hardware platforms, including mobile CPU, edge GPU, and cloud GPU. Without performance loss on Cityscapes, our EfficientViT provides up to 13.9$\\times$ and 6.2$\\times$ GPU latency reduction over SegFormer and SegNeXt, respectively. For super-resolution, EfficientViT delivers up to 6.4x speedup over Restormer while providing 0.11dB gain in PSNR. For Segment Anything, EfficientViT delivers 48.9x higher throughput on A100 GPU while achieving slightly better zero-shot instance segmentation performance on COCO.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-29\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Alternate Training of Shared and Task-Specific Parameters for Multi-Task Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: parameter sharing neural networks*\n\n*Alessandra Papini, Francesco Della Santa, Stefania Bellavia*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces novel alternate training procedures for hard-parameter sharing Multi-Task Neural Networks (MTNNs). Traditional MTNN training faces challenges in managing conflicting loss gradients, often yielding sub-optimal performance. The proposed alternate training method updates shared and task-specific weights alternately, exploiting the multi-head architecture of the model. This approach reduces computational costs, enhances training regularization, and improves generalization. Convergence properties similar to those of the classical stochastic gradient method are established. Empirical experiments demonstrate delayed overfitting, improved prediction, and reduced computational demands. In summary, our alternate training procedures offer a promising advancement for the training of hard-parameter sharing MTNNs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Heteroskedastic and Imbalanced Deep Learning with Adaptive Regularization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive regularization deep learning*\n\n*Kaidi Cao, Yining Chen, Junwei Lu, Adrien Gaidon, Tengyu Ma, Nikos Arechiga*\n\n**Abstract:** Real-world large-scale datasets are heteroskedastic and imbalanced -- labels have varying levels of uncertainty and label distributions are long-tailed. Heteroskedasticity and imbalance challenge deep learning algorithms due to the difficulty of distinguishing among mislabeled, ambiguous, and rare examples. Addressing heteroskedasticity and imbalance simultaneously is under-explored. We propose a data-dependent regularization technique for heteroskedastic datasets that regularizes different regions of the input space differently. Inspired by the theoretical derivation of the optimal regularization strength in a one-dimensional nonparametric classification setting, our approach adaptively regularizes the data points in higher-uncertainty, lower-density regions more heavily. We test our method on several benchmark tasks, including a real-world heteroskedastic and imbalanced dataset, WebVision. Our experiments corroborate our theory and demonstrate a significant improvement over other methods in noise-robust deep learning.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2021-1\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-29\n\n\n\n#### 6. Meta-Learning without Memorization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive regularization deep learning*\n\n*Chelsea Finn, Sergey Levine, Mingzhang Yin, George Tucker, Mingyuan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability to learn new concepts with small amounts of data is a critical aspect of intelligence that has proven challenging for deep learning methods. Meta-learning has emerged as a promising technique for leveraging data from previous tasks to enable efficient learning of new tasks. However, most meta-learning algorithms implicitly require that the meta-training tasks be mutually-exclusive, such that no single model can solve all of the tasks at once. For example, when creating tasks for few-shot image classification, prior work uses a per-task random assignment of image classes to N-way classification labels. If this is not done, the meta-learner can ignore the task training data and learn a single model that performs all of the meta-training tasks zero-shot, but does not adapt effectively to new image classes. This requirement means that the user must take great care in designing the tasks, for example by shuffling labels or removing task identifying information from the inputs. In some domains, this makes meta-learning entirely inapplicable. In this paper, we address this challenge by designing a meta-regularization objective using information theory that places precedence on data-driven adaptation. This causes the meta-learner to decide what must be learned from the task training data and what should be inferred from the task testing input. By doing so, our algorithm can successfully use data from non-mutually-exclusive tasks to efficiently adapt to novel tasks. We demonstrate its applicability to both contextual and gradient-based meta-learning algorithms, and apply it in practical settings where applying standard meta-learning has been difficult. Our approach substantially outperforms standard meta-learning algorithms in these settings.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-efficient implementations of linear attention mechanisms, advanced parameter sharing techniques, and adaptive regularization methods, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n1. **Sparse Attention Architectures**:\n   The paper on \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" introduces a novel sparse attention architecture that achieves significant efficiency improvements while maintaining strong performance. It uses a hardware-friendly sparse attention pattern that shards the context heterogeneously among attention heads, combining sparse and dense attention to balance efficiency and performance. This approach results in substantial speed-ups in both training and inference.\n\n2. **DuoAttention**:\n   DuoAttention is another mechanism that optimizes memory usage and processing speed for long-context language models. It categorizes attention heads into Retrieval and Streaming Heads, dynamically adjusting cache allocation to minimize memory usage and computational load. This approach is particularly efficient for handling long contexts and real-time interactions, making it a viable option for hardware-efficient implementations.\n\n3. **Memristor-Based Accelerators**:\n   The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This design accelerates transformer self-attention by up to 10 times compared to digital counterparts, leveraging analog matrix operations integrated into memory. This approach is highly efficient in terms of power consumption and latency.\n\n## Advanced Parameter Sharing Techniques in Neural Networks\n\n1. **Hybrid Sparse and Dense Attention**:\n   The \"Hardware-Aware Context Sharding Among Attention Heads\" paper discusses a hybrid architecture that combines sparse and dense attention. This design allows for efficient parameter sharing by ensuring that each attention head attends to a different subset of tokens while collectively covering the full context. This hybrid approach balances efficiency and performance, making it a promising direction for parameter sharing in attention mechanisms.\n\n2. **Selective State Space Models (S6 Models)**:\n   The \"Improving Efficiency in Sequence Models\" article mentions S6 models, which integrate selective state space models with a selection mechanism computed via a scan. These models dynamically prioritize different parts of the input data, enabling efficient parameter usage by focusing on the most relevant parts of the input sequence. This selectivity allows for better performance and efficiency in various tasks.\n\n## Adaptive Regularization Methods for Maintaining Model Stability\n\n1. **Test-Time Model Adaptation**:\n   The insight from \"Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\" suggests using an active sample selection criterion and a Fisher regularizer to maintain model stability during test-time adaptation. This approach minimizes the entropy loss and constrains important model parameters from drastic changes, ensuring that the model adapts efficiently without forgetting previous knowledge[Analysis Note].\n\n2. **Adaptive Regularization in Sparse Attention**:\n   While not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, the concept of adaptive regularization can be applied to sparse attention mechanisms. For instance, using adaptive sparsity patterns and regularization techniques to ensure that the model does not overfit or forget important parameters during test-time adaptation. This can be explored further by integrating insights from sparse attention architectures and test-time adaptation methods.\n\nIn summary, the papers and insights provided highlight several key strategies for improving autoregressive language model design:\n\n- **Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention**: Implementations like sparse attention architectures, DuoAttention, and memristor-based accelerators offer significant efficiency gains.\n- **Advanced Parameter Sharing**: Hybrid sparse and dense attention, and selective state space models (S6 models) provide efficient ways to share parameters and focus on relevant input data.\n- **Adaptive Regularization**: Techniques such as active sample selection and Fisher regularizers can help maintain model stability during test-time adaptation.\n\nThese strategies can be combined to create a highly efficient and scalable autoregressive language model.\n",

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials.

We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 5. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

While recent works have shown preliminary evidence for the efficacy of early exiting in accelerating LLM inference, EE-LLM makes a foundational step towards scaling up early-exit LLMs by supporting their training and inference with massive 3D parallelism. Built upon Megatron-LM, EE-LLM implements a variety of algorithmic innovations and performance optimizations tailored to early exiting, including a lightweight method that facilitates backpropagation for the early-exit training objective with pipeline parallelism, techniques of leveraging idle resources in the original pipeline schedule for computation related to early-exit layers, and two approaches of early-exit inference that are compatible with KV caching for autoregressive generation.

Token-wise Decomposition of Autoregressive Language Model Hidden States for Analyzing Model Predictions\n\n*From Search Query: upcoming innovations in autoregressive language models*\n\n*Byung-Doh Oh, William Schuler*\n\n**TL;DR:** A linear decomposition of final hidden states from autoregressive language models based on each initial input token is presented, which is exact for virtually all contemporary Transformer architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** While there is much recent interest in studying why Transformer-based large language models make predictions the way they do, the complex computations performed within each layer have made their behavior somewhat opaque. To mitigate this opacity, this work presents a linear decomposition of final hidden states from autoregressive language models based on each initial input token, which is exact for virtually all contemporary Transformer architectures. This decomposition allows the definition of probability distributions that ablate the contribution of specific input tokens, which can be used to analyze their influence on model probabilities over a sequence of upcoming words with only one forward pass from the model. Using the change in next-word probability as a measure of importance, this work first examines which context words make the biggest contribution to language model predictions. Regression experiments suggest that Transformer-based language models rely primarily on collocational associations, followed by linguistic factors such as syntactic dependencies and coreference relationships in making next-word predictions. Additionally, analyses using these measures to predict syntactic dependencies and coreferent mention spans show that collocational association and repetitions of the same token largely explain the language models\u2019 predictions on these tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

They have shifted the field from application-specific model pipelines to a single model that is adapted to a wide range of tasks. Autoregressive PLMs like GPT-3 or PaLM and associated techniques like fewshot learning, have additionally shifted the output modality to generation instead of classification or regression. Despite their ubiquitous use, the generation quality of language models is rarely evaluated when these models are introduced. Additionally, it is unclear how existing generation tasks\u2013while they can be used to compare systems at a high level\u2013relate to the real world use cases for which people have been adopting them. In this work, we discuss how to adapt existing application-specific generation benchmarks to PLMs and provide an in-depth, empirical study of the limitations and capabilities of PLMs in natural language generation tasks along dimensions such as scale, architecture, input and output language. Our results show that PLMs differ in their applicability to different data regimes and their generalization to multiple languages.

HGRN2: Gated Linear RNNs with State Expansion\n\n*From Search Query: limitations of hierarchical transformers 2023*\n\n*Yiran Zhong, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Songlin Yang, Zhen Qin*\n\n**Abstract:** Hierarchically gated linear RNN (HGRN, \\citealt{HGRN}) has demonstrated competitive training speed and performance in language modeling while offering efficient inference. However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, limiting its expressiveness. To address this issue, we introduce a simple outer product-based state expansion mechanism, which significantly enlarges the recurrent state size without introducing any additional parameters. This enhancement also provides a linear attention interpretation for HGRN2, enabling hardware-efficient training. Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN consistently across different settings and competitive with other recurrent models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 2. Increasing The Performance of Cognitively Inspired Data-Efficient Language Models via Implicit Structure Building\n\n*From Search Query: limitations of hierarchical transformers 2023*\n\n*Laura Kallmeyer, David Arps, Omar Momen*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we describe our submission to the BabyLM Challenge 2023 shared task on data-efficient language model (LM) pretraining (Warstadt et al., 2023). We train transformer-based masked language models that incorporate unsupervised predictions about hierarchical sentence structure into the model architecture. Concretely, we use the Structformer architecture (Shen et al., 2021) and variants thereof. StructFormer models have been shown to perform well on unsupervised syntactic induction based on limited pretraining data, and to yield performance improvements over a vanilla transformer architecture (Shen et al., 2021). Evaluation of our models on 39 tasks provided by the BabyLM challenge shows promising improvements of models that integrate a hierarchical bias into the architecture at some particular tasks, even though they fail to consistently outperform the RoBERTa baseline model provided by the shared task organizers on all tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n ### Understanding the Goal and Intent of the Researcher\n\nThe researcher is aiming to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that can outperform current state-of-the-art models.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3. Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. 3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Ho Hin Lee, Shunxing Bao, Yuankai Huo, Bennett A. Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Chaitanya K. Ryali, Yuan-Ting Hu, Daniel Bolya, Chen Wei, Haoqi Fan, Po-Yao (Bernie) Huang, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Arkabandhu Chowdhury, Omid Poursaeed, Judy Hoffman, J. Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Latent Representation and Simulation of Markov Processes via Time-Lagged Information Bottleneck\n\n*From Search Query: temporal latent bottleneck*\n\n*Marco Federici, Patrick Forr'e, Ryota Tomioka, Bastiaan S. Veeling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error.\n\n**Abstract:** Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. VIBE: Topic-Driven Temporal Adaptation for Twitter Classification\n\n*From Search Query: temporal latent bottleneck*\n\n*Yuji Zhang, Jing Li, Wenjie Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reflects feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and proposes a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions, which utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time.\n\n**Abstract:** Language features are evolving in real-world social media, resulting in the deteriorating performance of text classification in dynamics. To address this challenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are tested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or knowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social media data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information Bottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the distinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with timestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time. Substantial Twitter experiments on three classification tasks show that our model, with only 3% of data, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art continued-pretraining methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. A Dual-Stream Neural Network Explains the Functional Segregation of Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways in Human Brains\n\n*From Search Query: dual-stream attention*\n\n*Minkyu Choi, Kuan Han, Xiaokai Wang, Yizhen Zhang, Zhongming Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is speculated that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** The human visual system uses two parallel pathways for spatial processing and object recognition. In contrast, computer vision systems tend to use a single feedforward pathway, rendering them less robust, adaptive, or efficient than human vision. To bridge this gap, we developed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human eyes and brain. At the input level, the model samples two complementary visual patterns to mimic how the human eyes use magnocellular and parvocellular retinal ganglion cells to separate retinal inputs to the brain. At the backend, the model processes the separate input patterns through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to mimic how the human brain uses the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways for parallel visual processing. The first branch (WhereCNN) samples a global view to learn spatial attention and control eye movements. The second branch (WhatCNN) samples a local view to represent the object around the fixation. Over time, the two branches interact recurrently to build a scene representation from moving fixations. We compared this model with the human brains processing the same movie and evaluated their functional alignment by linear transformation. The WhereCNN and WhatCNN branches were found to differentially match the dorsal and ventral pathways of the visual cortex, respectively, primarily due to their different learning objectives. These model-based results lead us to speculate that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs. This dual-stream model takes a further step in brain-inspired computer vision, enabling parallel neural networks to actively explore and understand the visual surroundings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. DualGATs: Dual Graph Attention Networks for Emotion Recognition in Conversations\n\n*From Search Query: dual-stream attention*\n\n*Duzhen Zhang, Feilong Chen, Xiuyi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC.\n\n**Abstract:** Capturing complex contextual dependencies plays a vital role in Emotion Recognition in Conversations (ERC). Previous studies have predominantly focused on speaker-aware context modeling, overlooking the discourse structure of the conversation. In this paper, we introduce Dual Graph ATtention networks (DualGATs) to concurrently consider the complementary aspects of discourse structure and speaker-aware context, aiming for more precise ERC. Specifically, we devise a Discourse-aware GAT (DisGAT) module to incorporate discourse structural information by analyzing the discourse dependencies between utterances. Additionally, we develop a Speaker-aware GAT (SpkGAT) module to incorporate speaker-aware contextual information by considering the speaker dependencies between utterances. Furthermore, we design an interaction module that facilitates the integration of the DisGAT and SpkGAT modules, enabling the effective interchange of relevant information between the two modules. We extensively evaluate our method on four datasets, and experimental results demonstrate that our proposed DualGATs surpass state-of-the-art baselines on the majority of the datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 8.

In this paper, we present a generic Dual-stream Network (DS-Net) to fully explore the representation capacity of local and global pattern features for image classification. Our DS-Net can simultaneously calculate fine-grained and integrated features and efficiently fuse them. Specifically, we propose an Intra-scale Propagation module to process two different resolutions in each block and an Inter-Scale Alignment module to perform information interaction across features at dual scales. Besides, we also design a Dual-stream FPN (DS-FPN) to further enhance contextual information for downstream dense predictions. Without bells and whistles, the propsed DS-Net outperforms Deit-Small by 2.4% in terms of top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1k and achieves state-of-the-art performance over other Vision Transformers and ResNets. For object detection and instance segmentation, DS-Net-Small respectively outperforms ResNet-50 by 6.4% and 5.5 % in terms of mAP on MSCOCO 2017, and surpasses the previous state-of-the-art scheme, which significantly demonstrates its potential to be a general backbone in vision tasks.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer*\n\n*Henryk Michalewski, Christian Szegedy, Yuhuai Wu, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Szymon Tworkowski, Piotr Nawrot*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-transformers-are-more-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: temporal latent bottleneck*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Nitesh B. Gundavarapu, Yoshua Bengio, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Kshitij Gupta, Aniket Didolkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: temporal latent bottleneck*\n\n*Adelle Coster, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Lincan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.

DSCA: A Dual-Stream Network with Cross-Attention on Whole-Slide Image Pyramids for Cancer Prognosis\n\n*From Search Query: dual-stream attention*\n\n*Luping Ji, Bin Xu, Rui Yang, Feng Ye, Bo Fu, Pei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The cancer prognosis on gigapixel Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) has always been a challenging task. To further enhance WSI visual representations, existing methods have explored image pyramids, instead of single-resolution images, in WSIs. In spite of this, they still face two major problems: high computational cost and the unnoticed semantical gap in multi-resolution feature fusion. To tackle these problems, this paper proposes to efficiently exploit WSI pyramids from a new perspective, the dual-stream network with cross-attention (DSCA). Our key idea is to utilize two sub-streams to process the WSI patches with two resolutions, where a square pooling is devised in a high-resolution stream to significantly reduce computational costs, and a cross-attention-based method is proposed to properly handle the fusion of dual-stream features. We validate our DSCA on three publicly-available datasets with a total number of 3,101 WSIs from 1,911 patients. Our experiments and ablation studies verify that (i) the proposed DSCA could outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in cancer prognosis, by an average C-Index improvement of around 4.6%; (ii) our DSCA network is more efficient in computation -- it has more learnable parameters (6.31M vs. 860.18K) but less computational costs (2.51G vs. 4.94G), compared to a typical existing multi-resolution network. (iii) the key components of DSCA, dual-stream and cross-attention, indeed contribute to our model's performance, gaining an average C-Index rise of around 2.0% while maintaining a relatively-small computational load. Our DSCA could serve as an alternative and effective tool for WSI-based cancer prognosis.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. GD-CAF: Graph Dual-stream Convolutional Attention Fusion for Precipitation Nowcasting\n\n*From Search Query: dual-stream attention*\n\n*Siamak Mehrkanoon, Lorand Vatamany*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate precipitation nowcasting is essential for various applications, including flood prediction, disaster management, optimizing agricultural activities, managing transportation routes and renewable energy. While several studies have addressed this challenging task from a sequence-to-sequence perspective, most of them have focused on a single area without considering the existing correlation between multiple disjoint regions. In this paper, we formulate precipitation nowcasting as a spatiotemporal graph sequence nowcasting problem. In particular, we introduce Graph Dual-stream Convolutional Attention Fusion (GD-CAF), a novel approach designed to learn from historical spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and nowcast future time step ahead precipitation at different spatial locations. GD-CAF consists of spatio-temporal convolutional attention as well as gated fusion modules which are equipped with depthwise-separable convolutional operations. This enhancement enables the model to directly process the high-dimensional spatiotemporal graph of precipitation maps and exploits higher-order correlations between the data dimensions.

Additionally, visualizations of averaged seasonal spatial and temporal attention scores across the test set offer valuable insights into the most robust connections between diverse regions or time steps.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the proposed **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Novelty and Existing Research\n\n### Hierarchical Processing Structure\nThe concept of hierarchical processing is not new and has been explored in various contexts. For instance, the hierarchical RL approach described in involves breaking tasks into smaller parts using a hierarchy of policy networks, which is similar in principle to the hierarchical multi-scale architecture proposed. However, the specific application to language models, particularly with dual-stream architectures and temporal latent bottlenecks, needs to be compared against existing models.\n\n### Dual-Stream Processing\nThe idea of dual-stream processing, where information is processed at different temporal scales, is reminiscent of the hierarchical multimodal model HiTime, which integrates temporal information into LLMs using a hierarchical feature encoder. This model processes time series data through both fast and slow streams, aligning with the proposed dual-stream architecture.\n\n### Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\nThe use of temporal latent bottlenecks for efficient memory management is a unique aspect. However, the Ladderpath approach discussed in involves characterizing hierarchical structures in neural networks, which might provide insights into how to optimize the structural orderliness and efficiency of the proposed model.\n\n### Adaptive State Compression and Multi-scale Feature Fusion\nAdaptive state compression and multi-scale feature fusion are critical components. The CLanG model described in uses a multi-layer GNN-cluster module to capture hierarchical event representations, which involves graph pooling and coarsening the input graph. This could provide a framework for understanding how to implement adaptive compression and feature fusion effectively.\n\n## Comparison with Existing Models\n\n### Hierarchical Transformers\nHierarchical transformers are a subject of ongoing research. The HiTime model, for example, employs a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data, which could be adapted for language modeling tasks.\n\n### Similarity with Sibling Designs\nComparing the proposal with sibling designs like **compressivehierarchicalttt** and **sparsekeyfasttttlinear** is crucial. The hierarchical and interpretable multi-task RL approach in and the hierarchical graph networks in can provide insights into how different hierarchical structures are implemented and their unique contributions.\n\n## Impact on Performance Metrics\n\n### Accuracy, Robustness, Efficiency, and Scalability\nThe integration of hierarchical multi-scale processing, dual-stream architectures, and temporal latent bottlenecks could significantly impact performance metrics. The HiTime model, for instance, achieves state-of-the-art classification performance by integrating temporal features into LLMs, which suggests potential improvements in accuracy and robustness.\n\n### Implementation Feasibility\nImplementation challenges such as training stability and computational overhead need to be assessed. The Ladderpath approach in highlights the importance of structural orderliness, which could guide the optimization of the proposed model's architecture to ensure stability and efficiency.\n\n## Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Structure**: The proposal's hierarchical multi-scale architecture aligns with recent advancements in hierarchical models, such as HiTime and hierarchical RL approaches. This suggests that the concept is sound but needs to be tailored specifically for language modeling tasks.\n- **Dual-Stream Processing**: The dual-stream architecture is novel in the context of language models but has parallels in other domains like time series classification. This could provide a robust framework for processing long sequences efficiently.\n- **Temporal Latent Bottlenecks**: This aspect is unique and could significantly enhance memory management and efficiency. However, it requires careful implementation to ensure stability and optimal performance.\n- **Adaptive State Compression and Feature Fusion**: These mechanisms are critical for optimizing memory usage and information flow. Models like CLanG provide valuable insights into how to implement these effectively.\n\n## Future Search Plan\n\n- **Recent Advancements in Hierarchical Transformers**: Investigate the latest research on hierarchical transformers to see if there are any new techniques or architectures that could be integrated into the proposal.\n- **Existing Works on Temporal Latent Bottlenecks**: Search for any existing works that specifically integrate temporal latent bottlenecks with similar architectures to understand potential challenges and benefits.\n- **Implementation Challenges**: Examine implementation challenges reported in similar models to anticipate and mitigate potential issues in the proposed model.\n\n## List of References\n\n- **Ladderpath Approach**:\n- **Hierarchical RL Approach**:\n- **Hierarchical Graph Networks**:\n- **HiTime Model**:\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, the researcher can develop a comprehensive understanding of the novelty, potential impact, and implementation feasibility of the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal.\n",

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/41 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2308.16137, 2023.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 3.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

To this end, we introduce the Differentiable Search Index (DSI), a new paradigm that learns a text-to-text model that maps string queries directly to relevant docids; in other words, a DSI model answers queries directly using only its parameters, dramatically simplifying the whole retrieval process. We study variations in how documents and their identifiers are represented, variations in training procedures, and the interplay between models and corpus sizes. Experiments demonstrate that given appropriate design choices, DSI significantly outperforms strong baselines such as dual encoder models. Moreover, DSI demonstrates strong generalization capabilities, outperforming a BM25 baseline in a zero-shot setup.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 207  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n#### 5. Birth of a Transformer: A Memory Viewpoint\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformer memory*\n\n*A. Bietti, Vivien A. Cabannes, Diane Bouchacourt, H. J\u00e9gou, L. Bottou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work illustrates the fast learning of global bigrams and the slower development of an\"induction head\"mechanism for the in-context bigrams, and highlights the role of weight matrices as associative memories, as well as providing theoretical insights on how gradients enable their learning during training, and study the roles of data-distributional properties.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models based on transformers have achieved great empirical successes. However, as they are deployed more widely, there is a growing need to better understand their internal mechanisms in order to make them more reliable. These models appear to store vast amounts of knowledge from their training data, and to adapt quickly to new information provided in their context or prompt. We study how transformers balance these two types of knowledge by considering a synthetic setup where tokens are generated from either global or context-specific bigram distributions. By a careful empirical analysis of the training process on a simplified two-layer transformer, we illustrate the fast learning of global bigrams and the slower development of an\"induction head\"mechanism for the in-context bigrams. We highlight the role of weight matrices as associative memories, provide theoretical insights on how gradients enable their learning during training, and study the role of data-distributional properties.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression in language models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression in language models*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime.\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 8. Language Agent Tree Search Unifies Reasoning Acting and Planning in Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression in language models*\n\n*Andy Zhou, Kai Yan, Michal Shlapentokh-Rothman, Haohan Wang, Yu-Xiong Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental evaluation across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA), web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance.\n\n**Abstract:** While language models (LMs) have shown potential across a range of decision-making tasks, their reliance on simple acting processes limits their broad deployment as autonomous agents. In this paper, we introduce Language Agent Tree Search (LATS) -- the first general framework that synergizes the capabilities of LMs in reasoning, acting, and planning. By leveraging the in-context learning ability of LMs, we integrate Monte Carlo Tree Search into LATS to enable LMs as agents, along with LM-powered value functions and self-reflections for proficient exploration and enhanced decision-making. A key feature of our approach is the incorporation of an environment for external feedback, which offers a more deliberate and adaptive problem-solving mechanism that surpasses the constraints of existing techniques. Our experimental evaluation across diverse domains, including programming, interactive question-answering (QA), web navigation, and math, validates the effectiveness and generality of LATS in decision-making while maintaining competitive or improved reasoning performance. Notably, LATS achieves state-of-the-art pass@1 accuracy (92.7%) for programming on HumanEval with GPT-4 and demonstrates gradient-free performance (average score of 75.9) comparable to gradient-based fine-tuning for web navigation on WebShop with GPT-3.5.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size. To support more research based on sliding-window attention, we open source our project and release our checkpoints at: https://github.com/SHI-Labs/Neighborhood-Attention-Transformer .\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-14\n\n\n\n#### 2. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical linear attention*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Memory AMP\n\n*From Search Query: compressive transformer memory*\n\n*Brian M. Kurkoski, Shunqi Huang, Lei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being used in large-scale systems. To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results' validity and accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Image and Video Tokenization with Binary Spherical Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression in language models*\n\n*Philipp Kr\u00e4henb\u00fchl, Yuanjun Xiong, Yue Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new transformer-based image and video tokenizer with Binary Spherical Quantization (BSQ). BSQ projects the high-dimensional visual embedding to a lower-dimensional hypersphere and then applies binary quantization. BSQ is (1) parameter-efficient without an explicit codebook, (2) scalable to arbitrary token dimensions, and (3) compact: compressing visual data by up to 100$\\times$ with minimal distortion. Our tokenizer uses a transformer encoder and decoder with simple block-wise causal masking to support variable-length videos as input. The resulting BSQ-ViT achieves state-of-the-art visual reconstruction quality on image and video reconstruction benchmarks with 2.4$\\times$ throughput compared to the best prior methods. Furthermore, by learning an autoregressive prior for adaptive arithmetic coding, BSQ-ViT achieves comparable results on video compression with state-of-the-art video compression standards. BSQ-ViT also enables masked language models to achieve competitive image synthesis quality to GAN- and diffusion-based methods.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. ERNIE-Tiny : A Progressive Distillation Framework for Pretrained Transformer Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive state compression in language models*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, Hua Wu, Hao Tian, Yu Sun, Weixin Liu, Jiaxiang Liu, Shikun Feng, Xuyi Chen, Weiyue Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) such as BERT adopt a training paradigm which first pretrain the model in general data and then finetune the model on task-specific data, and have recently achieved great success. However, PLMs are notorious for their enormous parameters and hard to be deployed on real-life applications. Knowledge distillation has been prevailing to address this problem by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a much smaller student over a set of data. We argue that the selection of thee three key components, namely teacher, training data, and learning objective, is crucial to the effectiveness of distillation. We, therefore, propose a four-stage progressive distillation framework ERNIE-Tiny to compress PLM, which varies the three components gradually from general level to task-specific level. Specifically, the first stage, General Distillation, performs distillation with guidance from pretrained teacher, gerenal data and latent distillation loss. Then, General-Enhanced Distillation changes teacher model from pretrained teacher to finetuned teacher. After that, Task-Adaptive Distillation shifts training data from general data to task-specific data. In the end, Task-Specific Distillation, adds two additional losses, namely Soft-Label and Hard-Label loss onto the last stage. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework and generalization gain brought by ERNIE-Tiny.In particular, experiments show that a 4-layer ERNIE-Tiny maintains over 98.0%performance of its 12-layer teacher BERT base on GLUE benchmark, surpassing state-of-the-art (SOTA) by 1.0% GLUE score with the same amount of parameters. Moreover, ERNIE-Tiny achieves a new compression SOTA on five Chinese NLP tasks, outperforming BERT base by 0.4% accuracy with 7.5x fewer parameters and9.4x faster inference speed.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-04\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, focusing on efficiency, scalability, and accuracy.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark. It also sets a new SOTA test perplexity on One-Billion Word dataset with 5x fewer model parameters than that of the previous-best Transformer-based models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/34 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nWe defer the detailed analysis to appendix Section A. 5 and A.6. ## 8 Experiments And Results\n\nWe have implemented the proposed hierarchical attention using Jax, an open source library ${ }^{5}$ for automatic gradient computation and linear algebra operations on GPUs and TPUs. All numerical operations in our algorithm use the Numpy native linear algebra functions supported by Jax. In all our experiments in this section, we use the standard Transformer architecture described in (Vaswani et al., 2017) as the backbone for our HTransformer-1D model. Unless specified otherwise, the model parameters are: number of layers is 6 , number of heads is 8 , word embedding size is 512 and the feed-forward module (FFN) size is 2048 . We follow the API for the standard multihead scaled dot-product attention implementation ${ }^{6}$ so that we can perform a simple drop-in replacement of the standard multihead attention with our hierarchical attention implementation. This allows for an easy and fair comparison. ### 8.1 Long-Range Arena\n\nThe open-source Long-Range Arena (LRA) benchmark ${ }^{7}$ has been proposed as a standard way to probe and quantify the capabilities of various xformer (long-range Transformer) architectures (Tay et al., 2020c). In our case, it also serves to highlight the effectiveness of the inductive bias inspired by the H-Matrix method, as well as the capability of our hierarchical attention to handle long sequences. The LRA has several desirable qualities that made us focus on it as a primary evaluation benchmark: generality (restricted to encoder-only tasks\n\n[^3]to accommodate most proposals); simplicity (no pretraining, no data augmentation allowed); difficulty (large headroom with existing approaches); long-input focus (so that modeling improvements in this area are visible); diverse (6 tasks, covering math, language, image, and spatial modeling); and lightweight (so that modeling improvements are measurable independently of the ability to train and run high-capacity models). The tasks that comprise LRA are: ListOps (sequences of arithmetical expressions of lengths of up to 2 K that tests the ability to reason hierarchically while handling long context); Text (byte/character-level text classification at document level, which both simulates longer input sequences - max length 4 K - and increases the difficulty level); Retrieval (byte/character-level document retrieval, which simulates the ability to model document similarity as a score between two independently-encoded long input sequences - max length $4 \\mathrm{~K}+4 \\mathrm{~K}=8 \\mathrm{~K}$ ); Image (image classification based on the CIFAR-10 dataset, where an NxN image is flattened to a sequence of length $\\mathrm{N}^{2}$ pixels); Pathfinder (long-range spatial dependency task, with images consisting of two small circles and dash-line paths that either connect the two circles or not - image dimensions of $32 \\times 32$ for a pixel sequence of length 1,024); Path-X (same as Pathfinder, but for image dimensions of $128 \\times 128$ for a total pixel sequence of length 16,384). The default Transformer model parameters such as number of layers and number of heads etc are pre-determined by the benchmark configuration for each task. The results obtained by our H-Transformer-1D model on the LRA benchmark are given in Table 1. Overall, the H-Transformer-1D model achieves 61.41 average accuracy, a +6.4 points improvement over the previous-best average performance from BigBird (Zaheer et al., 2020). We want to highlight ListOps, Text and Retrieval because they all involve long sequences and H-Transformer-1D model improves SOTA performance by relatively large margins. These should be strong evidences to support our hypothesis in section 5.1 and validate the inductive bias due to the hierarchical attention. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Path-X | Avg |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Chance | 10.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 10.00 | 50.00 | 50.00 | 44.00 |\n| Transformer | 36.37 | 64.27 | 57.46 | 42.44 | 71.40 | FAIL | 54.39 |\n| Local Attention | 15.82 | 52.98 | 53.39 | 41.46 | 66.63 | FAIL | 46.06 |\n| Sparse Trans. | 17.07 | 63.58 | $\\underline{59.59}$ | $\\underline{44.24}$ | 71.71 | FAIL | 51.24 |\n| Longformer | 35.63 | 62.85 | 56.89 | 42.22 | 69.71 | FAIL | 53.46 |\n| Linformer | 35.70 | 53.94 | 52.27 | 38.56 | $\\mathbf{7 6 . 3 4}$ | FAIL | 51.36 |\n| Reformer | $\\underline{37.27}$ | 56.10 | 53.40 | 38.07 | 68.50 | FAIL | 50.67 |\n| Sinkhorn Trans. | 33.67 | 61.20 | 53.83 | 41.23 | 67.45 | FAIL | 51.39 |\n| Synthesizer | 36.99 | 61.68 | 54.67 | 41.61 | 69.45 | FAIL | 52.88 |\n| BigBird | 36.05 | 64.02 | 59.29 | 40.83 | 74.87 | FAIL | $\\underline{55.01}$ |\n| Linear Trans. | 16.13 | $\\underline{65.90}$ | 53.09 | 42.34 | 75.30 | FAIL | 50.55 |\n| Performer | 18.01 | 65.40 | 53.82 | 42.77 | $\\mathbf{7 7 . 0 5}$ | FAIL | 51.41 |\n| H-Transformer-1D | $\\mathbf{4 9 .\n```\n\n#### 3. Compositional Attention: Disentangling Search and Retrieval (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Sarthak Mittal, S. Raparthy, I. Rish, Yoshua Bengio, Guillaume Lajoie*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2021)\t**Cited by** 13  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure, and demonstrates that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-head, key-value attention is the backbone of the widely successful Transformer model and its variants. This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/40 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nWe refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020) for a more detailed analysis of different transformer variants. Additional Inductive Biases. While a lot of the above transformer variations are designed to prevent the quadratic bottleneck, most of them also add certain additional inductive biases in the model. For example, the addition of sparsity not only reduces the computational complexity but also adds the additional inductive bias of sparse information routing between different elements. There are certain additional variants (Lamb et al., 2021; Goyal et al., 2021b) that add other inductive biases, eg. factorized state space and global workspace bottleneck respectively in the transformer model. ## A. 3 MODULARITY, COMPOSITIONALITY, REUSABILITY AND BOTTLENECK\n\nThere have been recent efforts along the lines of modularized computations in an effort to improve the model's capacity to perform systematic generalization. In particular, humans are able to compartmentalize information and act on it in a disentangled, context-driven and robust fashion. These cognitive fundamentals have led to a preliminary movement of Machine Learning systems into this space. We discuss some of the essential ingredients below. Modularity. Modularity refers to factorization of knowledge into smaller components that can independently exist and act on sensory information. It can be considered as disentangled representations that allow for interventions on these different components or factorized mechanisms where each mechanism has a specific purpose and can act on a part or whole of the sensory information. The fundamental aim of modularity is to prevent unrestricted information flow across a whole monolitihic system and instead to learn in an often end-to-end fashion factorized representations and mechanisms that act on these representations. Recent works (Goyal et al., 2019; 2020; 2021a; Mittal et al., 2020; Madan et al., 2021; Lamb et al., 2021; Ke et al., 2021) along the lines of factorizing knowledge demonstrate that it often leads to increased robustness and better OoD performance. Compositionality and Reusability. Humans are able to perform complex tasks even in novel and unknown situations. This capacity often stems from the fact that our complex actions are in reality compositions of simpler primitives and our understanding of these primitives is so good that we are able to dynamically combine these primitives into novel complex actions. Recent research has started looking into tasks and systems that test and allow for compositional generalization (Lake \\& Baroni, 2018a; Li et al., 2019; Keysers et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020; Hupkes et al., 2020; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020), which is generalization to novel combinations of the underlying primitives/mechanisms. The primary reason why a number of modular systems are constructed in recurrent domains is because we want the factorized mechanisms to be reusable in a number of scenarios. Reusability of knowledge (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019) allows for learning of disentangled mechanisms in a modular system which then has the potential to lead to efficient compositions of the learned disentangled mechanisms. Recent success of systems that use computations that can be reused multiple times demonstrates that reusability is actually an important fundamental for obtaining compositionality. Bottleneck. Conscious attention in humans is a key ingredient to create a bottleneck of information processing, according to the Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene et al., 2017). The key use of this bottleneck is to restrict information flow across the whole network, human brain or otherwise, which allows for robustness to insignificant pieces of sensory information. The usefulness of this bottleneck has been hypothesized to be linked to the sparsity and simplicity of the dependencies manipulated with System 2 cognition (Bengio, 2017; Goyal \\& Bengio, 2020). Recent works along these lines (Goyal et al., 2021b) illustrate that modular systems with the addition of a bottleneck efficiently factorize computations and then compose them in a dynamic and context dependent fashion often lead to improved performance, faster adaptation and systematic generalization (Bengio et al., 2019; Ke et al., 2021). ## B PROPOSED MODEL\n\nIn this section, we provide additional details about the general motivation, architecture setup and our argument for using parameter sharing across layers. We further provide details about computational complexity of the proposed model and some ablations that we consider. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=473&width=1392&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=364)\n\nFigure 8: Performance on Contextual Retrieval Task. We compare our proposed model against standard Multi-Head attention (lower loss is better) on various setups of the task. Our proposed model outperforms the baseline across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. ## B. 1 MotivATION\n\nWhile the setting in Figure 1 may look idealistic in the sense that it is very likely that transformer heads do not learn this interpretable single feature functions for search and retrieval, we argue that this rigidity still exists between search and retrieval in a standard multi-head attention framework. To see this, we note that the search component Search $_{h}$, is parameterized by the query and key matrices $W_{q_{h}}$ and $W_{k_{h}}$ respectively and the retrieval component Retrieval ${ }_{h}$ is parameterized by the value matrices $W_{v_{h}}$. Both these components lead to computations that are dynamic based on the input but\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-16.jpg?height=45&width=1386&top_left_y=1227&top_left_x=367) (notice the same $h$ subscript), also highlighted in Equation 5. Thus, whenever there is a need to share retrieval parameterizations across multiple searches, a standard multi-head attention would lead to learning of redundancies because there is no notion of sharing of retrievals between searches. Contrasting this with the proposed approach, Compositional Attention, we see that now there is a notion of sharing of retrievals for different searches. That is, two different searches can still opt for the same retrieval parameterization, which alleviates the rigidity and redundancy that is explained above. Note that this discussion does not depend on the model's capacity to selectively pick features as is illustrated in Figure 1. This shows that irrespective of what these searches and retrievals learn, the discussed drawbacks of multi-head attention still exist if an optimal solution requires sharing of retrievals across searches. We highlight the motivation through the idealistic example of multiple features solely for ease of explanation and appealing to the fundamental cognitively inspired inductive bias that we try to incorporate. We emphasize that multi-head attention and the proposed compositional attention are not two separate classes of methods. In fact, our proposed mechanism is a strict superset of multi-head attention and thus presents a more general framework that subsumes the family of multi-head attention. One can see this from Equation 13 where, given enough capacity to represent any $h \\times h$ matrix, we recover multi-head attention by setting the number of searches and retrievals as $h$ and having the \"Value Scores\" matrix as an $h \\times h$ identity matrix (or any $h \\times h$ permutation matrix in general), with $h$ being the number of heads. Thus our mechanism not only solves the redundancies highlighted in this text but also provides a more general class of attention mechanism. ## B. 2 DIFFERENCES FROM EXISTING WORK\n\nWe propose Compositional Attention, a novel attention mechanism aimed at a disentangled computation of search and retrieval. Unlike in multi-head attention, this allows for a flexible and dynamic composition of searches and retrievals. This is different from MAC and its variants (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018) because the proposed algorithm is a completely parallel system without recurrence. Further, we see that in MAC, disentanglement is driven by privileged information; i.e. through the difference between what a question and image is. This privileged information may not be present across a variety of tasks (eg. language modelling, classification, etc.). Our proposed model, however, does not require privileged information and is therefore easily applicable to a lot of different domains. Further, MAC\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-17.jpg?height=473&width=1391&top_left_y=276&top_left_x=367)\n\nFigure 9: Performance on OoD Contextual Retrieval Task. We showcase that our proposed mechanism outperforms standard Multi-Head attention (lower is better) on out of distribution (OoD) variant of the various setups across various model capacities (low and high) and number of heads. does not have multiple parallel searches and retrievals and thus, our proposed model aims to solve a considerably different problem. While one may be tempted to think of head pruning (Michel et al., 2019; Voita et al., 2019) as a way of removing redundancies in standard multi-head attention, we stress that the core goal and motivation of our work is considerably different. Pruning of a head essentially means we eliminate a rigid search-retrieval pairing from the learned system as its utility for solving the task is negligible. However, in this work, the redundancy we want to solve is when a sub-part of a head is redundant but not the whole head. That is, when either the search or retrieval part of the head is redundant, but not both. Figure 1 highlights when only a sub-part of the head is redundant and not the whole head, and how compositional attention resolves the problem. Further, Compositional Attention is different from the various transformer variants Appendix A. 2 because it does not aim to solve the quadratic computational bottleneck but instead adds an inductive bias that has not been explored yet. We also note that the proposed model is amenable to the various computation tricks discovered for multi-head attention. ## B. 3 ARCHitECTURE DETAILS\n\nThe standard transformer model (Vaswani et al., 2017) has a number of layers, where each layer is composed of two components, the multi-head attention (Section 2.1) which is followed by a MLP (Multi-layer perceptron) with a single hidden layer. There are residual connections at the end of the multi-head attention step as well as the MLP. In this work, we follow Dehghani et al. (2018) and consider the models that have weight sharing across layers. For ease of experiments, we do not consider adaptive stopping criteria. We consider this choice because we want reusable pieces of computations, and Universal Transformers is one step towards that goal. Our view of transformer models is that different heads perform parallel information retrieval with not only different kinds of searches but also different kinds of retrievals. Information from these parallel retrievals is then jointly processed through a linear layer, followed by another MLP. There are residual connections after the linear layer and the MLP. For our proposed Compositional variants, we basically replace Multi-Head Attention in the models with Compositional Attention while keeping all the other details the same. ## B. 4 MultiPle LayERS AND WEIGHT SHARING\n\nA number of works demonstrate that Transformers with weight sharing are competitive with the standard transformer models (Dehghani et al., 2018; Bai et al., 2019). We also believe that reusing computations provides more pressure on the system to learn meaningful and multi-purpose parameters (eg. it is easier to learn a redundant head if it is used only once vs if it is repeatedly used). One might be tempted to think that increasing the number of layers or removing weight sharing might compensate for the flexibility provided by our proposed system. However, we argue otherwise. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-18.jpg?height=414&width=1381&top_left_y=281&top_left_x=380)\n\nFigure 10: Convergence on Contextual Retrieval Task. We see that the proposed mechanism converges faster and works well even in low data regime (low iterations). Lets assume we have a Transformer model without parameter sharing which has $l$ layers and $h$ heads. Then, the number of unique search-retrieval pairings that can be computed by the model is $l h$ ( $h$ if parameter sharing). Contrasting this with compositional attention, we see that the number of unique search-retrieval pairings are actually $l s r$ ( $s r$ if parameter sharing) where $s$ is the number of searches and $r$ the number of retrievals. So, if we use a similar number of layers, compositional attention still allows for more combinatorial possibilities to be learnt. Viewed another way, at scale, the proposed mechanism has the potential to reduce the number of layers needed for tasks calling for flexible search and retrievals. Another important point is that even if we have more layers (with or without parameter sharing), multi-head attention can still only learn a rigid combination between search and retrieval. So, if the task requires dynamic choice from all possible pairings between search and retrieval, the model will have to learn each pairing in separate head combinations, whether it be in the same or future layers. This is because adding more layers does not change the way searches and retrievals are combined, which is what we focus on here. ## B. 5 COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY\n\nNumber of Parameters. We keep the parameter counts within 5\\% of each other for the compared models and the same parameter count at 140M parameters for the language modelling experiment. We also stress that our proposed models with fewer retrievals are even more tightly matched and often lower in parameters than the baseline and still outperform them on a number of tasks. Training Time. While Compositional Attention increases the complexity of the model, we note that the training time of proposed models are generally within $\\sim 10 \\%$ of the baseline and hence the added complexity does not impede the model much. FLOPs. We estimate the FLOPs of the proposed model for Equilateral Triangle Detection task using an off the shelf library ${ }^{2}$ and see that they are $\\sim 10 \\%$ of each other and the baseline. In particular, we also see that for fewer retrievals, the FLOPs are either the same or lower than the baseline. Parallel Computations. Transformers allow for efficient implementation using GPUs due to parallel computations for each word in the sentence (or each object in the scene). Further, they allow for parallel computation of each head for each word. Correspondingly, in our proposed model, we still do parallel computations for each word in the sentence, and compute the output of different searches in parallel. The only additional complexity is another soft-attention for choice of retrieval for each search. This is also done in parallel for each search and hence we retain all the major efficiencies that Multi-Head attention enjoys on GPUs. Amenable to Different Variations. We note that a lot of the current advances in standard multi-head attention, eg. sparse attention matrix, can be incorporated in the proposed model too. We can also have sparsity on the retrieval end where we can restrict certain searches to pick from a smaller set of retrievals. We believe that these analysis are important future works but out of scope of this paper. Complexity vs Combinatorial Advantages. While we sometimes have more complexity than multihead attention, this small increase in complexity is often offset by the combinatorial advantage that\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_5de3d65737610c02fb8cg-19.jpg?height=394&width=1399&top_left_y=264&top_left_x=363)\n\nFigure 11: Specialization plots for the Contextual Retrieval Task. We plot the attention scores for ground truth retrieval vs learned retrieval for different task setups - left: 1 search 2 retrieval, middle: 1 search 4 retrieval, and right: 2 search 4 retrieval. we gain. In particular, for $h$ search and retrievals, multi-head attention can only compute $h$ possible search-retrieval pairings while the proposed model can compute $h^{2}$ possible pairings.\n```\n\n#### 4.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 10 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 6 raw search queries input to the search frame: novel adaptive state compression 2023, recent hierarchical attention transformers, innovations in linear attention mechanisms, novel adaptive state compression 2023, recent hierarchical attention transformers, innovations in linear attention mechanisms\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 6 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. SLAMB: Accelerated Large Batch Training with Sparse Communication\n\n*From Search Query: novel adaptive state compression 2023*\n\n*Hang Xu, Wenxuan Zhang, Jiawei Fei, Yuzhe Wu, Tingwen Xie, Jun Huang, Yuchen Xie, Mohamed Elhoseiny, Panos Kalnis*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper combines sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB) to propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed training of large deep neural networks requires frequent exchange of massive data be-tween machines, thus communication efficiency is a major concern. Existing compressed communication methods are either not compatible with large batch optimization algorithms, or do not provide sufficient speedup in large scale. In this paper, we combine sparsification-based gradient compression with the layer-wise adaptive moments optimizer for large batch training (LAMB). We propose SLAMB, a novel communication-efficient optimizer that supports large batch sizes and scales to thousands of GPUs. SLAMB employs momentum masking, local error compensation, and element-wise adaptive rescaling to achieve accurate layer-wise weight updates, which translates to fast convergence for very large batches. Our empirical results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art, SLAMB transmits half the amount of data in large-batch BERT pre-training, without sacrificing accuracy. Moreover, SLAMB achieves excellent scalability in large computing infrastructures. For instance, SLAMB with 128 GPUs reduces the training time of Swin Transformer pre-training on ImageNet to 5.35 hours, which is 2 hours faster than the state-of-the-art. At the extreme, we trained BERT-XL (2.8B parameters) on 1,024 NVIDIA A100 GPUs, where SLAMB achieved 90% scaling efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5%, 15.1%, 13.0% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Although this property is partly attributed to the self-attention mechanism, there is still a lack of systematic understanding. In this paper, we examine the role of self-attention in learning robust representations. Our study is motivated by the intriguing properties of the emerging visual grouping in Vision Transformers, which indicates that self-attention may promote robustness through improved mid-level representations. We further propose a family of fully attentional networks (FANs) that strengthen this capability by incorporating an attentional channel processing design. We validate the design comprehensively on various hierarchical backbones. Our model achieves a state-of-the-art 87.1% accuracy and 35.8% mCE on ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-C with 76.8M parameters.

Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Beyond 512 Tokens: Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical Encoder for Long-Form Document Matching\n\n*From Search Query: recent hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Liu Yang, Michael Bendersky, Mingyang Zhang, Marc Najork, Cheng Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Many natural language processing and information retrieval problems can be formalized as the task of semantic matching. Existing work in this area has been largely focused on matching between short texts (e.g., question answering), or between a short and a long text (e.g., ad-hoc retrieval). Semantic matching between long-form documents, which has many important applications like news recommendation, related article recommendation and document clustering, is relatively less explored and needs more research effort. In recent years, self-attention based models like Transformers and BERT have achieved state-of-the-art performance in the task of text matching. These models, however, are still limited to short text like a few sentences or one paragraph due to the quadratic computational complexity of self-attention with respect to input text length. In this paper, we address the issue by proposing the Siamese Multi-depth Transformer-based Hierarchical (SMITH) Encoder for long-form document matching. Our model contains several innovations to adapt self-attention models for longer text input. In order to better capture sentence level semantic relations within a document, we pre-train the model with a novel masked sentence block language modeling task in addition to the masked word language modeling task used by BERT. Our experimental results on several benchmark datasets for long-form document matching show that our proposed SMITH model outperforms the previous state-of-the-art models including hierarchical attention, multi-depth attention-based hierarchical recurrent neural network, and BERT. Comparing to BERT based baselines, our model is able to increase maximum input text length from 512 to 2048. We will open source a Wikipedia based benchmark dataset, code and a pre-trained checkpoint to accelerate future research on long-form document matching.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. MaxViT: Multi-Axis Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: recent hierarchical attention transformers*\n\n*Yinxiao Li, Alan Bovik, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang, Han Zhang, Hossein Talebi, Zhengzhong Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively blending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to ''see'' globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains 86.5% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our model achieves 88.7% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module.

GhostFaceNets: Lightweight Face Recognition Model From Cheap Operations\n\n*From Search Query: innovations in linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Naoufel Werghi, Yahya Zweiri, Abdulhadi Shoufan, Sajid Javed, Oussama Abdul Hay, Mohamad Alansari*\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning-based biometric models that can be deployed on devices with constrained memory and computational resources has proven to be a significant challenge. Previous approaches to this problem have not prioritized the reduction of feature map redundancy, but the introduction of Ghost modules represents a major innovation in this area. Ghost modules use a series of inexpensive linear transformations to extract additional feature maps from a set of intrinsic features, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the underlying information. GhostNetV1 and GhostNetV2, both of which are based on Ghost modules, serve as the foundation for a group of lightweight face recognition models called GhostFaceNets. GhostNetV2 expands upon the original GhostNetV1 by adding an attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies. Evaluation of GhostFaceNets using various benchmarks reveals that these models offer superior performance while requiring a computational complexity of approximately 60\u2013275 MFLOPs. This is significantly lower than that of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) big convolutional neural network (CNN) models, which can require hundreds of millions of FLOPs. GhostFaceNets trained with the ArcFace loss on the refined MS-Celeb-1M dataset demonstrate SOTA performance on all benchmarks. In comparison to previous SOTA mobile CNNs, GhostFaceNets greatly improve efficiency for face verification tasks.

Equiformer: Equivariant Graph Attention Transformer for 3D Atomistic Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: innovations in linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Tess Smidt, Yi-Lun Liao*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their widespread success in various domains, Transformer networks have yet to perform well across datasets in the domain of 3D atomistic graphs such as molecules even when 3D-related inductive biases like translational invariance and rotational equivariance are considered. In this paper, we demonstrate that Transformers can generalize well to 3D atomistic graphs and present Equiformer, a graph neural network leveraging the strength of Transformer architectures and incorporating SE(3)/E(3)-equivariant features based on irreducible representations (irreps). First, we propose a simple and effective architecture by only replacing original operations in Transformers with their equivariant counterparts and including tensor products. Using equivariant operations enables encoding equivariant information in channels of irreps features without complicating graph structures. With minimal modifications to Transformers, this architecture has already achieved strong empirical results. Second, we propose a novel attention mechanism called equivariant graph attention, which improves upon typical attention in Transformers through replacing dot product attention with multi-layer perceptron attention and including non-linear message passing. With these two innovations, Equiformer achieves competitive results to previous models on QM9, MD17 and OC20 datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are some key points and additional information that can be useful:\n\n### Understanding the Goal and Intent\n\nThe researcher aims to enhance the existing **FastTTTLinear** model by incorporating several advanced mechanisms:\n- **Hierarchical multi-scale processing**\n- **Dual-stream architectures (fast and slow streams)**\n- **Temporal latent bottlenecks**\n- **Adaptive state compression**\n- **Multi-scale feature fusion**\n\nThe objectives include improving memory management, hierarchical understanding, computational efficiency, and scalability for long-sequence processing.\n\n### Key Areas to Focus On\n\n#### Hierarchical Processing and Dual-Stream Architectures\n- **Recent Advances**: Search for the latest papers on hierarchical attention mechanisms, such as those building upon the **H-Transformer-1D**.
