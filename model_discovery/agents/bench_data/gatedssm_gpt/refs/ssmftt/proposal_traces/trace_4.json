Final Rating**\n\n```rating 2.8```\n\n**6. Justification for Rating**\n\nThe proposal **HardwareOptimizedFastTTTLinear** presents an interesting idea to enhance FastTTTLinear by integrating hardware-aware structured matrices. However, the proposal lacks sufficient novelty, as similar concepts have been explored in existing work like Monarch Mixer. The proposal does not adequately address critical challenges such as causality enforcement and preservation of TTT capabilities. Additionally, there is a lack of empirical evidence to support claims of improved accuracy, efficiency, and scalability.\n\nTo improve the proposal, it is essential to clearly differentiate it from existing models, provide detailed strategies for overcoming implementation challenges, and include empirical results demonstrating the benefits. Without these elements, the proposal does not meet the high standards of quality and clear value beyond existing approaches.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nWhile the proposal has potential, significant work is needed to ensure it offers a meaningful contribution to the field. By addressing the suggestions provided, the proposal can be strengthened to better demonstrate its novelty, feasibility, and potential impact.\n\n---",

This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, Hydra outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/32 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473 (2014).

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 3. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.31)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/67 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\n2023.

Specifically, the Scalable Matrix Extensions (SME) and its enhancements, such as SME2, include support for structured sparsity and quarter tile operations. These instructions can optimize matrix multiplications, which are crucial for many machine learning workloads, including those involving Toeplitz matrices. The new structured-sparsity instructions can efficiently handle matrices with many zero elements, reducing memory footprint and computational complexity.\n\n## Novel Hardware Acceleration Techniques\n- The concept of exploiting unique patterns in Toeplitz matrices for hardware acceleration is highlighted in the work by Chen et al. (2023). This research suggests that cyclic convolution properties of Toeplitz matrices can be leveraged for specialized hardware acceleration, which could be a novel approach for optimizing FastTTTLinear's toeplitz-like computations[3 in the context of your analysis].\n\n## Specialized Instruction Sets\n- Modern processors, as discussed in Liu et al. (2024), offer specialized instructions for certain structured matrix operations. These instructions, although largely unexploited in deep learning frameworks, hold potential for optimizing linear transformations and matrix operations specific to Toeplitz matrices. Utilizing these instructions can significantly improve the efficiency of matrix operations in LMs[3 in the context of your analysis].\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n- The use of SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data) instructions, as described in the context of Java and AI, can be highly beneficial for parallelizing matrix operations. SIMD models allow a single processor to perform the same operation on multiple data points simultaneously, which can be particularly effective for the structured and repetitive nature of Toeplitz matrix computations.\n\n## Structured Matrix Operations\n- Numerical Linear Algebra for Big Data emphasizes the importance of advanced techniques for handling large-scale matrices, including sparse matrix algorithms and parallel computation. These techniques are essential for optimizing the performance of machine learning models, especially those involving structured matrices like Toeplitz matrices. By leveraging these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient and scalable LM designs.\n\nIn summary, the key areas to focus on include:\n- Utilizing SME and SME2 instructions for efficient matrix operations and sparsity handling.\n- Exploiting the cyclic convolution properties of Toeplitz matrices for specialized hardware acceleration.\n- Leveraging SIMD instructions and other parallel computation models to optimize matrix operations.\n- Integrating hardware-specific cost models to guide the design of optimized computation patterns for structured matrices.\n\nThese approaches can help in creating more efficient, scalable, and hardware-optimized autoregressive language models.\n",

This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, Hydra outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/32 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473 (2014).

However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 37/51 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.11986, 2021.

Pruning Filter in Filter\n\n*From Search Query: hardware matrix compression techniques SME2*\n\n*Fanxu Meng, Hao Cheng, Ke Li, Huixiang Luo, Xiao-Wei Guo, Guangming Lu, Xing Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** Through extensive experiments, it is demonstrated that SWP is more effective compared to the previous FP-based methods and achieves the state-of-art pruning ratio on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets without obvious accuracy drop.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning has become a very powerful and effective technique to compress and accelerate modern neural networks. Existing pruning methods can be grouped into two categories: filter pruning (FP) and weight pruning (WP). FP wins at hardware compatibility but loses at the compression ratio compared with WP. To converge the strength of both methods, we propose to prune the filter in the filter. Specifically, we treat a filter $F \\in \\mathbb{R}^{C\\times K\\times K}$ as $K \\times K$ stripes, \\emph{i.e.}, $1\\times 1$ filters $\\in \\mathbb{R}^{C}$, then by pruning the stripes instead of the whole filter, we can achieve finer granularity than traditional FP while being hardware friendly. We term our method as SWP (\\emph{Stripe-Wise Pruning}). SWP is implemented by introducing a novel learnable matrix called Filter Skeleton, whose values reflect the shape of each filter. As some recent work has shown that the pruned architecture is more crucial than the inherited important weights, we argue that the architecture of a single filter, \\emph{i.e.}, the shape, also matters. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that SWP is more effective compared to the previous FP-based methods and achieves the state-of-art pruning ratio on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets without obvious accuracy drop.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/35 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\nFigure 3 also includes a baseline row factoring a matrix of appropriately scaled i.i.d. Gaussian entries, to indicate typical errors for factoring an unstructured matrix. ### 4.2 Neural Network Compression\n\nMany structured matrix approaches have been proposed to replace fully-connected (FC) layers of neural networks, to speed up training and inference, and to reduce the memory consumption. These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/35 (Score: 0.30)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.19)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 3. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/67 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\n2023.

Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/53 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 57th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 2978-2988, 2019.

To date, these transformations rely on carefully designed algorithms, such as the famous fast Fourier transform (FFT) algorithm, and on specialized implementations (e.g., FFTW and cuFFT). Moreover, each specific transform requires hand-crafted implementations for every platform (e.g., Tensorflow and PyTorch lack the fast Hadamard transform), and it can be difficult to know when they are useful. Ideally, these barriers would be addressed by automatically learning the most effective transform for a given task and dataset, along with an efficient implementation of it. Such a method should be capable of recovering a range of fast transforms with high accuracy and realistic sizes given limited prior knowledge. It is also preferably composed of differentiable primitives and basic operations common to linear algebra/machine learning libraries, that allow it to run on any platform and be integrated into modern ML frameworks such as PyTorch/Tensorflow. More fundamentally, this problem ties into the foundational question of understanding the minimal prior knowledge needed to learn high-speed systems, in the spirit of modern trends toward relaxing manually imposed structure (i.e., AutoML). Recent progress in this vein of learning computational primitives includes addition/multiplication gates [43], the Strassen $2 \\times 2$ matrix multiplication algorithm [44, and PDE solvers [19]. We propose a method that addresses this problem for a class of important transforms that includes the\naforementioned examples. A key challenge lies in defining or parameterizing the space of transforms and corresponding fast algorithms, which requires using a minimal amount of prior knowledge that captures important and interesting transforms while remaining learnable and efficient. Egner \\& P\u00fcschel [13, 14] previously posed this question and a novel combinatorial approach, but their solution only addresses a limited set of transforms (primarily DFT) and only on limited problem sizes. In particular, these approaches search through an exponentially large discrete space using a symbolic form of the matrix [13, 14] and recover the solution only up to dimensions $8 \\times 8$. We instead draw two key lessons from the work of De Sa et al. 8, who characterize matrices with efficient matrix-vector multiplication algorithms as being factorizable into products of sparse matrices ${ }^{1}$ Thus, the task of learning algorithms can be reduced to finding appropriate sparse matrix product representations of the transforms. They further show that divide-and-conquer schemes lead to fast multiplication algorithms for a surprisingly general set of structured matrices. Motivated by the broad applicability of this recursive structure, we propose a particular factorization using sequences of special block diagonal matrices, called butterfly matrices. Specific instances of butterfly structure have been used before - for example as a random orthogonal preconditioner [36] or in matrix approximation [28 - but we use a relaxed representation that captures a larger class of structures and can learn from data. These form a class of structured matrices with $O(N)$ parameters and automatic fast multiplication in $O(N \\log N)$ operations. We empirically validate our method in two ways. First, we consider a specification of a transform (e.g., $N$ input-output pairs) and attempt to factorize it. We successfully recover a fast algorithm up to machine precision for several important transforms such as the DFT, Hadamard, DCT, and convolution for realistic sizes (dimensions up to $N=1024$ ), while standard sparse and low-rank baselines cannot (Section 4.1). Beyond recovering famous transforms, we additionally incorporate this method in end-to-end ML pipelines to learn fast and compressible latent transformations (Section 4.2). On the benchmark single hidden layer network, this parameterization exceeds the classification accuracy of a baseline fully connected layer on several datasets - such as by 3.9 points on CIFAR- 10 while using 40X fewer parameters-which is to our knowledge the first time a structured model has outperformed the unconstrained model for this task on a realistic dataset 42. We also find that the addition of a lightweight butterfly layer improves the accuracy of a modern ResNet architecture by 0.43 points. Finally, our method is simple with an easily implementable fast algorithm. We compare the training and inference speed of our implementation to specialized implementations of discrete transforms (Section 4.3). Our generic representation comes within 3-5X of implementations for specific transforms such as the DFT and DCT, while still being capable of learning a rich class of more general transforms. ## 2 Related Work\n\nFast transforms are crucial and ubiquitous in the machine learning pipelines, from data preprocessing, feature generation, and dimensionality reduction to compressing models. For example, the DFT and DCT form the basis of the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs), a standard feature representation for speech recognition [21]. State-of-the-art kernel approximation methods leverage circulant matrices (i.e., convolution) 49] and the DFT and Hadamard transform [24, 50] for fast projection. Structured matrices, which are matrix representations of fast transforms, play a crucial role in designing fast neural network layers with few parameters 40, 10. Given their importance, there have been significant efforts in finding more and more general classes of fast transforms. Traditional classes of structured matrices such as the Toeplitz, Hankel, Vandermonde, and Cauchy matrices are ubiquitous in engineering and signal processing [35], and more recently have found use in deep learning. These were generalized under the seminal notion of low displacement rank (LDR) introduced by Kailath et al. [22], and were later unified under a single class of displacement structure (the confluent Cauchy-like matrices) introduced by Olshevsky \\& Shokrollahi 34 to solve the Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation problem. Another class of fast transforms that directly generalize the DFT and DCT are based on orthogonal polynomials [7], which find usage in areas from differential equations to optics. Both orthogonal polynomial transforms [12], and all of the previously introduced matrices with displacement rank structure, were further\n\n[^0]significantly generalized under a single class by De Sa et al. 8. Notably, almost all of the structured matrix classes mentioned here exhibit a form of recursive structure in their construction and superfast algorithms. Since the product of sparse matrices immediately has a fast multiplication algorithm, the problem of sparse matrix factorization has been tackled in many settings. Sparse PCA 51] and dictionary learning [29] factor a matrix into two components, one of which is sparse. Sparse matrix factorization with more than two factors has also been considered, for example in the setting where the true matrix is the product of random sparse matrices 33, or in the context of learning multi-layer sparse approximations 25, 26. Our approach differs from these in that we focus on the recursive structure of the transforms - not just the sparsity of their factors-leading to sparse and structured transforms, and avoiding the discreteness problem inherent to learning sparsity. Since most distinct transforms typically require significant work both to design fast algorithms and to efficiently implement them on different platforms, there have been attempts to automatically learn these fast algorithms. The field of algebraic signal processing [39] uses methods from representation theory of groups and algebras to automatically generate fast algorithms from the symbolic form of the transform matrix. However, these methods require search over a combinatorially-large discrete space, limiting their approaches to small matrices of size up to $8 \\times 8$ [14, 45]. Attempts to learn general algorithms such as matching 31, sorting [16], and traveling salesman [2] using differentiable architectures face a similar challenge of having to effectively explore a large discrete space. Thus, they only work for problems of size at most 100. By contrast, our approach simplifies the discreteness of the problem into learning a simpler set of permutations, allowing us to recover fast algorithms for realistic dimensions. Independently, there has been growing interest in compressed deep learning models, motivated by the goal of adapting them to resource-constrained environments. A common approach for learning compressed models involves replacing the unconstrained weight matrices with a class of structured matrices and learning directly on the parametrization of that class. The most effective methods use matrix classes that are explicitly related to Fourier transforms 40, or employ highly specialized and complicated recursive algorithms 42]. As our method also implicitly defines a highly compressible subclass of matrices with linear parameter count and efficient multiplication, it can be used as a drop-in replacement for matrices in such end-to-end ML models. ## 3 Recovering Fast Transforms\n\nWe now set up and describe our approach. We first reiterate the connection between fast algorithms and sparse matrix factorization, and briefly outline a quintessential divide-and-conquer algorithm (the FFT) as motivation. We then elaborate the details of our method for learning particular recursive algorithms, including a core permutation-learning step that enables it to capture a wider range of structures. We also discuss the expressive power of these matrices, including which transforms they capture perfectly, and define a hierarchy of matrix classes built on butterflies that can theoretically capture richer recursive structures. ### 3.1 Preliminaries\n\nSparse factorizations One method of constructing matrices with obvious fast matrix-vector multiplication is as a product of sparse matrices, so that multiplication by an arbitrary vector will have cost proportional to the total number of nonzeros of the matrices in the product. Surprisingly, the converse is also true. The notion of sparse product width (SPW) [8, which roughly corresponds to the total sparsity of a factorization of a matrix, turns out to be equivalent to the length of the shortest linear straight-line program describing a matrix (up to a constant). Hence, it is an optimal descriptor of the algorithmic complexity of matrix-vector multiplication on these types of models [3. Given the general correspondence between sparse factorization and fast algorithms, we consider specific types of discrete transforms and their recursive factorizations. This is a prototype for our parameterization of fast recursive algorithms in Section 3.2\n\nCase study: DFT The Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) transforms a complex input vector $x=$ $\\left[x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$ into a complex output vector $X=\\left[X_{0}, \\ldots, X_{N-1}\\right]$ by expressing the input in the basis of the complex exponentials:\n\n$$\nX_{k}=\\sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x_{n} e^{-\\frac{2 \\pi i}{N} k n}, \\quad k=0, \\ldots, N-1, N=2^{m}\n$$\n\nLet $\\omega_{N}:=e^{2 \\pi i / N}$ denote a primitive $N$-th root of unity. The DFT can be expressed as matrix multiplication by the DFT matrix $F_{N} \\in \\mathbb{C}^{N \\times N}$, where $\\left(F_{N}\\right)_{k n}=\\omega_{N}^{-k n}$. The DFT of size $N$ can be reduced to two DFTs of size $N / 2$ on the even indices and the odd indices:\n\n$$\nF_{N} x=\\left[\\begin{array}{l}\nF_{N / 2} x_{\\mathrm{even}}+\\Omega_{N / 2} F_{N / 2} x_{\\text {odd }} \\\\\nF_{N / 2} x_{\\text {even }}-\\Omega_{N / 2} F_{N / 2} x_{\\text {odd }}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $x_{\\text {even }}=\\left[x_{0}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{N-2}\\right], x_{\\text {odd }}=\\left[x_{1}, x_{3}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$, and $\\Omega_{N / 2}$ is the diagonal matrix with entries $1, \\omega_{N}^{-1}, \\ldots, \\omega_{N}^{-(N / 2-1)}$. This recursive structure yields the efficient recursive Cooley-Tukey Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm. This computation can be written as a matrix factorization\n\n$$\nF_{N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nI_{N / 2} & \\Omega_{N / 2} \\\\\nI_{N / 2} & -\\Omega_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nF_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\n\\text { Sort the even } \\\\\n\\text { and odd indices }\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nwhere $I_{N / 2}$ is the identity matrix, and the last factor is the permutation matrix $P_{N}$ that separates the even and odd indices (e.g., mapping $[0,1,2,3]$ to $[0,2,1,3]$ ) (see Figure 2]. Unrolling the recursion, we obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nF_{N} & =B_{N}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nF_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N} \\\\\n& =B_{N}\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nB_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & B_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cccc}\nF_{N / 4} & 0 & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & F_{N / 4} & 0 & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & F_{N / 4} & 0 \\\\\n0 & 0 & 0 & F_{N / 4}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nP_{N / 2} & 0 \\\\\n0 & P_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N} \\\\\n& =\\cdots \\\\\n& =\\left(B_{N} \\ldots\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nB_{2} & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\ldots & B_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\right)\\left(\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nP_{2} & \\ldots & 0 \\\\\n\\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\\n0 & \\ldots & P_{2}\n\\end{array}\\right] \\ldots P_{N}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe product of all the $B_{N / 2^{k}}$ matrices on the left is called a butterfly matrix, and each factor $B_{N / 2^{k}}$ is a $2 \\times 2$ block matrix of diagonal matrices called a butterfly factor. Figure 1 illustrates the sparsity pattern of the structured butterfly factors. One can also combine the product of permutation matrices on the right to obtain a single permutation called the bit-reversal permutation, which sorts the indices by the reverse of their binary representation (e.g. $[0, \\ldots, 7] \\rightarrow[0,4,2,6,1,5,3,7]$ ). Other transforms have similar recursive structure but differ in the entries of $B_{N / 2^{k}}$, and in the permutation. For example, the DCT involves separating the even and the odd indices, and then reversing the second half (e.g., $[0,1,2,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,1,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,3,1]$ ). Appendix A provides some examples of how important transforms, such as the DFT, DCT, Hadamard, and convolutions, can factor as similar products of sparse matrices. ### 3.2 Recovering Fast Transform Algorithms\n\nMany previous works attempt to compress generic matrices by sparsifying them. We note that allowing for products of matrices with a total sparsity budget is strictly more expressive than a single matrix with that sparsity, while retaining the same compression and computation complexity. Therefore one can hope to recover all fast algorithms by learning over the set of matrix products with a total sparsity budget. However, this is infeasible to learn due to the discreteness of the sparsity constraint (Section 122). We instead use a class of matrices built as products of specific factors that captures the recursive nature of many fast algorithms. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_bdb1f06984456725f946g-05.jpg?height=201&width=825&top_left_y=249&top_left_x=647)\n\nFigure 1: Butterfly matrix for $N=16$. From left to right: single copy of $B_{16}$, blocks of $B_{8}$, blocks of $B_{4}$, blocks of $B_{2}$. A butterfly parametrization Let $x=\\left[x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{N-1}\\right]$ be an input vector ${ }^{2}$ Let $\\mathcal{T}_{N}$ be a linear transform of size $N$ with matrix representation $T_{N} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N \\times N}$, where $\\mathbb{F} \\in\\{\\mathbb{R}, \\mathbb{C}\\}$. A general recursive structure is to separate the input vector into two halves by some permutation, apply the transform on each half, and combine the result in a linear manner by scaling by an diagonal matrix and adding the results. Written as a matrix factorization:\n\n$$\nT_{N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}\nD_{1} & D_{2} \\\\\nD_{3} & D_{4}\n\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{cc}\nT_{N / 2} & 0_{N / 2 \\times N / 2} \\\\\n0_{N / 2 \\times N / 2} & T_{N / 2}\n\\end{array}\\right] P_{N}\n$$\n\nwhere $P_{N}$ is some permutation matrix and $D_{1}, \\ldots, D_{4} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N / 2}$ are diagonal matrices. Inspired by the factors of the FFT, we call the matrix $\\left[\\begin{array}{ll}D_{1} & D_{2} \\\\ D_{3} & D_{4}\\end{array}\\right]$ a butterfly factor, denoted by $B_{N}$. Unrolling the recursion as in equation (1) gives the factorization $T_{N}=B^{(N)} P^{(N)}$, where $B^{(N)}$ is a butterfly matrix and $P^{(N)}$ is a permutation that can be written as the product of $\\log _{2}(N)$ simpler block permutations. We also consider composing this module, hence learn either\n\n$$\nT_{N}=B^{(N)} P^{(N)} \\quad T_{N}=B_{2}^{(N)} P_{2}^{(N)} B_{1}^{(N)} P_{1}^{(N)}\n$$\n\nwhich we term the BP and the BPBP parametrization respectively. One dimensional convolutions (i.e. circulant matrices) are notably captured by BPBP, since they can be computed via an FFT, a component-wise product, then an inverse FFT (see Appendix A). In the case of the FFT, as in Section 3.1 the entries of the butterfly factors are called twiddle factors, and the combined permutation $P^{(N)}$ is called the bit-reversal permutation. Learning a recursive permutation The butterfly blocks in the BP or BPBP parametrization have a fixed sparsity pattern and their parameters can be directly optimized. However, the transforms we are interested in capturing frequently require different permutations as part of the \"divide\" step, which form a set of discrete objects that we must consider. We will restrict to learning over permutations that have a simple structure often encountered in these algorithms: we assume that the distribution factors into $\\log _{2} N$ steps following the $\\log _{2} N$ recursive layers. At each step in the recursion, the permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ is allowed to either keep the first half and second half intact or separate the even and the odd indices (e.g., $[0,1,2,3] \\rightarrow[0,2,1,3]$ ). Then, it can choose to reverse the first half (e.g., $[0,1] \\rightarrow[1,0]$ ) and can choose to reverse the second half (e.g., $[2,3] \\rightarrow[3,2]$ ). Thus at each step, there are 3 binary choices and hence 8 possible permutations. These are illustrated in Figure 2, where $P_{N}^{a}$ denotes the permutation matrix on $N$ elements that separates the even and odd elements, $P_{N}^{b}$ denotes the permutation matrix that reverses the first half, and $P_{N}^{c}$ denotes the permutation matrix that reverses the second half. Instead of searching over $8^{\\log _{2} N}$ discrete permutations, we parameterize the permutation $P^{(N)}$ as a categorical distribution of these $8^{\\log _{2} N}$ permutations. The permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ at step $k$ is thus chosen as a convex combination of the 8 possible choices:\n\n$$\nP_{N / 2^{k}}=p_{c b a} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{a}+p_{c b} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b}+\\ldots\n$$\n\nThis can be learned by representing this probability distribution $\\left\\{p_{c b a}, p_{c b}, \\ldots\\right\\}$ for example via logits and the softmax.

One of 8 possible permutations can be constructed by multiplying a subset of these matrices in the presented order. We make the further simplification that the probabilities $p_{c b a}$ factor into the three components; conceptually, that the choices of choosing $P_{N / 2^{k}}^{c}, P_{N / 2^{k}}^{b}, P_{N / 2^{k}}^{a}$ to be part of the product are independent of each other. This results in the representation\n\n$$\nP_{N / 2^{k}}=\\prod_{s=c, b, a}\\left(p_{s} P_{N / 2^{k}}^{s}+\\left(1-p_{s}\\right) I\\right)\n$$\n\nThus we learn the permutation $P_{N / 2^{k}}$ via equation 3y optimizing over 3 logits $\\ell_{a}, \\ell_{b}, \\ell_{c}$ and setting $p_{s}=\\sigma\\left(\\ell_{s}\\right)$, where $\\sigma$ is the sigmoid function. To encourage the distribution over permutations to be peaked, one can add entropy regularization [15] or semantic loss [46.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n# Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations \n\nTri Dao ${ }^{1}$, Albert Gu ${ }^{1}$, Matthew Eichhorn ${ }^{2}$, Atri Rudra ${ }^{2}$, and Christopher R\u00e9 ${ }^{1}$<br>${ }^{1}$ Department of Computer Science, Stanford University<br>${ }^{2}$ Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University at Buffalo, SUNY<br>\\{trid,albertgu\\}@stanford.edu, \\{maeichho,atri\\}@buffalo.edu,<br>chrismre@cs.stanford.edu\n\nJanuary 1, 2021\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nFast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nHowever, we found that these tricks are not necessary. For example, the learned transforms in Section 4.1 typically put weight at least 0.99 on a permutation. Initialization As the BP or BPBP construction is a product of many matrices, proper initialization is crucial to avoid exponential blowup in the size of the entries or condition numbers (i.e., the exploding/vanishing gradient problem [37]). We aim to initialize each butterfly factor to be close to unitary or orthogonal, so that the magnitude of the inputs and outputs to the transform are preserved. This is easy since each of the factors $B_{N}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ has exactly two nonzeros in each row and column; for example in the real case, initializing each entry of $B_{k}$ as $\\mathcal{N}(0,1 / 2)$ guarantees $\\mathbb{E} B_{k}^{*} B_{k}=I_{N}$. Comparison to related methods Some previous works have examined similar butterfly matrices in numerical algebra or machine learning [36, 20, 32, mainly motivated by trying to parametrize cheap orthogonal matrices. Our parametrization, motivated by the goal of learning recursive transforms, differs in several ways from all previous works: 1 . We explicitly model and learn a permutation matrix $P$. 2. Our relaxation does not enforce the matrix to be orthogonal. 3. Our butterfly factors are ordered so that closer elements interact first (Figure 1), whereas some works (e.g. [32]) reverse the order. 4. Every work has a different weight-tying scheme; ours ties the blocks in each butterfly factor, leading to fewer parameters and a tighter recursive interpretation than for example [20]. Our main baseline for deep learning experiments is Thomas et al. 42, who define a special matrix class with a complicated recursive algorithm. While our BP method and theirs share some overlap (e.g., they both capture circulant matrices), they have a distinct parametrization, and the exact relation between the BP hierarchy and their LDR-SD or LDR-TD classes is unknown. From a practical standpoint, BP is significantly faster and simpler to implement than their methods. ### 3.3 Expressivity and the butterfly hierarchy\n\nThe butterfly matrix $B$ has a total of $4 N$ learnable parameters (the butterfly factors $B_{N}, B_{N / 2}, \\ldots, B_{2}$ have $2 N, N, \\ldots, 4$ entries respectively). The overall permutation $P$ has $3 \\log _{2} N$ learnable parameters; we can also tie the logits of the $\\log _{2} N$ probabilistic permutations-reflecting the fact that for some algorithms the reduction from size $N$ to $N / 2$ is self-similar to the reduction from size $N / 2^{k}$ to $N / 2^{k+1}$ reducing this to just 3 parameters. We can define a natural hierarchy of matrix classes built on the BP primitive. This hierarchy covers a spectrum ranging from extremely structured matrices with a linear number of parameters, to the entire space of square matrices. Definition 1. For any dimension $N$, let $(\\mathrm{BP})_{r}^{k}(k, r \\in \\mathbb{N})$ denote the classes of matrices that can be expressed as\n\n$$\nS\\left(\\prod_{i=1}^{k} B_{i} P_{i}\\right) S^{T}\n$$\n\nwhere each $B_{i} P_{i} \\in \\mathbb{F}^{r N \\times r N}$ is a BP module as in equation (2), and $S \\in \\mathbb{F}^{N \\times r N}=\\left[\\begin{array}{llll}I_{N} & 0 & \\ldots & 0\\end{array}\\right]$ (that is, $S$ and $S^{T}$ select the upper left $N \\times N$ entries of the BP product matrix). The subscript $r$ is understood to be 1 if omitted. Note that the BP and BPBP classes are equivalent to (BP) ${ }^{1}$ and (BP) ${ }^{2}$ respectively. We remark that $B$ and $P$ are both capable of being the identity, and thus $(\\mathrm{BP})^{k} \\subseteq(\\mathrm{BP})^{k+1}$. The BP hierarchy is expressive enough to theoretically represent many important transforms with low depth, as well as all matrices with linear depth:\n\nProposition 1. $(B P)^{1}$ captures the fast Fourier transform, the fast Hadamard transform, and their inverses exactly. $(B P)^{2}$ captures the DCT, DST, and convolution exactly. All $N \\times N$ matrices are contained in $(B P)_{2}^{4 N+10}$. Proposition 1 is shown in Appendix B. We suggest some additional conjectures about the expressiveness of the BP hierarchy in Appendix D. Even though the BP parameterization is expressive, it still retains the learnability characteristic of compressed parameterizations. In fact, neural networks comprising layers of BP and BPBP matrices still have VC dimension that is almost linear in the number of parameters (Appendix B), similar to networks with fully-connected layers [1, 17] and LDR 42, which implies a corresponding sample complexity bound. ## 4 Empirical Evaluation\n\nWe evaluate the proposed approach to verify that our butterfly parameterization can both recover fast transforms and be integrated as an effective component in ML pipelines ${ }^{3}$, In Section 4.1, we confirm that it automatically learns the fast algorithms for many discrete transforms commonly used in signal processing and machine learning. Section 4.2 further shows that it can be a useful component to increase the performance of deep learning models while ensuring fast multiplication and few parameters by design. ### 4.1 Discrete Transforms\n\nBelow we list several important classes of structured matrices. Some of them are directly captured by our parametrization and we expect that they can be recovered close to perfectly, thus providing a $O(N \\log N)$ algorithm that closely approximates the naive $O\\left(N^{2}\\right)$ matrix multiplication. Others are not perfectly captured by the BPBP class but still have recursive structure; for these, we expect that our method reconstructs them better than standard matrix compression methods (sparse, low-rank, and combinations) can. Transforms We describe the matrices we evaluate on and their applications; a standard reference is Proakis 38.\n```\n\n#### 3. Scatterbrain: Unifying Sparse and Low-rank Attention Approximation (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Eric Winsor, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 93  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, Scatterbrain is proposed, a novel way to unify sparse and low-rank attention for accurate and efficient approximation and is unbiased with provably low error.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in efficient Transformers have exploited either the sparsity or low-rank properties of attention matrices to reduce the computational and memory bottlenecks of modeling long sequences. However, it is still challenging to balance the trade-off between model quality and efficiency to perform a one-size-fits-all approximation for different tasks. To better understand this trade-off, we observe that sparse and low-rank approximations excel in different regimes, determined by the softmax temperature in attention, and sparse + low-rank can outperform each individually. Inspired by the classical robust-PCA algorithm for sparse and low-rank decomposition, we propose Scatterbrain, a novel way to unify sparse (via locality sensitive hashing) and low-rank (via kernel feature map) attention for accurate and efficient approximation. The estimation is unbiased with provably low error. We empirically show that Scatterbrain can achieve 2.1x lower error than baselines when serving as a drop-in replacement in BigGAN image generation and pre-trained T2T-ViT. On a pre-trained T2T Vision transformer, even without fine-tuning, Scatterbrain can reduce 98% of attention memory at the cost of only 1% drop in accuracy. We demonstrate Scatterbrain for end-to-end training with up to 4 points better perplexity and 5 points better average accuracy than sparse or low-rank efficient transformers on language modeling and long-range-arena tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1901.02860, 2019.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Franz A. Heinsen*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers, which quantifies pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials, and linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a simple modification to the conventional attention mechanism applied by Transformers: Instead of quantifying pairwise query-key similarity with scaled dot-products, we quantify it with the logarithms of scaled dot-products of exponentials. Our modification linearizes attention with exponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is infinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size, enabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures. The source code is released at github.com/OpenNLPLab/TransnormerLLM.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/39 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nTable 3.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation.

By addressing the limitations of linear attention in varying sequence lengths without increasing memory consumption, this advancement democratizes access to state-of-the-art language models, potentially reducing the computational and environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems. Ethically, it underscores a move towards more sustainable AI practices, yet raises questions about the proliferation of powerful language models and their societal impacts, including concerns over privacy, misinformation, and the digital divide. ## References\n\nAlmazrouei, E., Alobeidli, H., Alshamsi, A., Cappelli, A., Cojocaru, R., Debbah, M., Goffinet, E., Heslow, D., Launay, J., Malartic, Q., et al.

The **Monarch Mixer** work by Fu et al. (2023) shows that Monarch matrices can replace attention and MLP components in Transformers, but it does not address TTT mechanisms.\n\n### Comparison with Existing Models\n- **Monarch Mixer** achieves sub-quadratic scaling and addresses causality but does not include TTT capabilities.\n- **FlashAttention** and **FlashAttention-2** focus on IO-aware attention computations and do not incorporate Monarch matrices or TTT.\n- **Gated Linear Attention Transformers** introduce hardware-efficient training for linear attention but differ in implementation from **FastTTTLinear**.\n\n### Implementation Feasibility\n\n#### Causality Enforcement\n- The researcher needs to ensure that the Monarch matrices are parameterized to maintain causality, as demonstrated in **Monarch Mixer**. This involves a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation.\n\n#### Training Stability\n- Structured matrices like Monarch matrices can pose challenges in training convergence and stability. Careful initialization and regularization strategies are necessary to mitigate these issues. References such as **Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training** by Dao et al. (2022) provide insights into these challenges and potential solutions.\n\n#### TTT Compatibility\n- Maintaining TTT capabilities is crucial. The proposal must explain how the integration of Monarch matrices affects the model's ability to adapt during test-time. This involves analyzing the interaction between hardware-aware optimizations and TTT mechanisms.\n\n#### Hardware Adaptability\n- The reliance on hardware-specific optimizations may limit the model's generality across different platforms. Strategies to ensure adaptability and efficiency on various hardware architectures need to be discussed. Works like **FlashAttention-2** that focus on better parallelism and work partitioning can provide valuable insights.\n\n### Potential Impact\n\n#### Efficiency and Scalability\n- Integrating Monarch matrices and IO-aware tiling strategies could significantly reduce memory bandwidth requirements and improve hardware utilization, enabling scaling to larger models or longer sequences with improved computational efficiency. This is supported by the efficiency gains seen in **FlashAttention** and **Monarch Mixer**.\n\n#### Model Performance\n- By balancing structure and expressiveness, the model could maintain or enhance accuracy and robustness. Preserving TTT capabilities while improving hardware efficiency could offer a unique advantage over existing models. The performance metrics and test cases from **Monarch Mixer** and **Gated Linear Attention Transformers** can serve as benchmarks.\n\n### Useful References and Insights\n\n- **Monarch Mixer** by Fu et al.

Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality (Avg.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/86 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.19427 (2024).

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Monarch structured matrices*\n\n*Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices, and proposes a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which is shown to be better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-optimized attention*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs, and parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory.\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 675  (*Influential: 69*)\n\n#### 3. Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention to Focus on Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-optimized attention*\n\n*Zicheng Liu, Siyuan Li, Li Wang, Zedong Wang, Yunfan Liu, Stan Z. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner and enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** To mitigate the computational complexity in the self-attention mechanism on long sequences, linear attention utilizes computation tricks to achieve linear complexity, while state space models (SSMs) popularize a favorable practice of using non-data-dependent memory pattern, i.e., emphasize the near and neglect the distant, to processing sequences. Recent studies have shown the priorities by combining them as one. However, the efficiency of linear attention remains only at the theoretical level in a causal setting, and SSMs require various designed constraints to operate effectively on specific data. Therefore, in order to unveil the true power of the hybrid design, the following two issues need to be addressed: (1) hardware-efficient implementation for linear attention and (2) stabilization of SSMs. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling and hierarchy to propose CHELA (short-long Convolutions with Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention), which replaces SSMs with short-long convolutions and implements linear attention in a divide-and-conquer manner. This approach enjoys global abstraction and data-dependent selection from stable SSM and linear attention while maintaining real linear complexity. Our comprehensive experiments on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Learning Physical Dynamics with Subequivariant Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: 3. IO-aware neural networks*\n\n*Jiaqi Han, Wenbing Huang, Hengbo Ma, Jiachen Li, J. Tenenbaum, Chuang Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel backbone, Subequivariant Graph Neural Network, is proposed, which relaxes equivariance to subequivariance by considering external fields like gravity, where the universal approximation ability holds theoretically.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become a prevailing tool for learning physical dynamics. However, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Physical laws abide by symmetry, which is a vital inductive bias accounting for model generalization and should be incorporated into the model design. Existing simulators either consider insufficient symmetry, or enforce excessive equivariance in practice when symmetry is partially broken by gravity. 2) Objects in the physical world possess diverse shapes, sizes, and properties, which should be appropriately processed by the model. To tackle these difficulties, we propose a novel backbone, Subequivariant Graph Neural Network, which 1) relaxes equivariance to subequivariance by considering external fields like gravity, where the universal approximation ability holds theoretically; 2) introduces a new subequivariant object-aware message passing for learning physical interactions between multiple objects of various shapes in the particle-based representation; 3) operates in a hierarchical fashion, allowing for modeling long-range and complex interactions. Our model achieves on average over 3% enhancement in contact prediction accuracy across 8 scenarios on Physion and 2X lower rollout MSE on RigidFall compared with state-of-the-art GNN simulators, while exhibiting strong generalization and data efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Implicit Regularization in Feedback Alignment Learning Mechanisms for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: 3.

While FA has potential applications in distributed and privacy-aware ML, limitations in multi-class classification and lack of theoretical understanding of the alignment mechanism have constrained its impact. This study introduces a unified framework elucidating the operational principles behind alignment in FA. Our key contributions include: (1) a novel conservation law linking changes in synaptic weights to implicit regularization that maintains alignment with the gradient, with support from experiments, (2) sufficient conditions for convergence based on the concept of alignment dominance, and (3) empirical analysis showing better alignment can enhance FA performance on complex multi-class tasks. Overall, these theoretical and practical advancements improve interpretability of bio-plausible learning rules and provide groundwork for developing enhanced FA algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: 3. IO-aware neural networks*\n\n*Guangji Bai, Ling Chen, Liang Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work forms the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics and builds a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points.\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal domain generalization is a promising yet extremely challenging area where the goal is to learn models under temporally changing data distributions and generalize to unseen data distributions following the trends of the change. The advancement of this area is challenged by: 1) characterizing data distribution drift and its impacts on models, 2) expressiveness in tracking the model dynamics, and 3) theoretical guarantee on the performance. To address them, we propose a Temporal Domain Generalization with Drift-Aware Dynamic Neural Network (DRAIN) framework. Specifically, we formulate the problem into a Bayesian framework that jointly models the relation between data and model dynamics. We then build a recurrent graph generation scenario to characterize the dynamic graph-structured neural networks learned across different time points. It captures the temporal drift of model parameters and data distributions and can predict models in the future without the presence of future data. In addition, we explore theoretical guarantees of the model performance under the challenging temporal DG setting and provide theoretical analysis, including uncertainty and generalization error. Finally, extensive experiments on several real-world benchmarks with temporal drift demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Monarch structured matrices*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Michael Poli, Benjamin Spector, Armin W. Thomas, Sabri Eyuboglu, Isys Johnson, Jessica Grogan, Simran Arora, Daniel Y. Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Conference:** monarch-mixer-a-simple-sub-quadratic-gemm\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 2. Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Monarch structured matrices*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Aniruddh Rao, Alexander Liu, Jessica Grogan, Michael Poli, Arjun Desai, Nimit Sohoni, Beidi Chen, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called \"reverse sparsification,\" Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-optimized attention*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Conglong Li, Xiaoxia Wu, Minjia Zhang, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-optimized attention*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 5. HL-Net: Heterophily Learning Network for Scene Graph Generation\n\n*From Search Query: 3. IO-aware neural networks*\n\n*DaCheng Tao, Zijian Li, Yibing Zhan, Changxing Ding, Xin Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to detect objects and predict their pairwise relationships within an image. Current SGG methods typically utilize graph neural networks (GNNs) to acquire context information between objects/relationships. Despite their effectiveness, however, current SGG methods only assume scene graph homophily while ignoring heterophily. Accordingly, in this paper, we propose a novel Heterophily Learning Network (HL-Net) to comprehensively explore the homophily and heterophily between objects/relationships in scene graphs. More specifically, HL-Net comprises the following 1) an adaptive reweighting transformer module, which adaptively integrates the information from different layers to exploit both the heterophily and homophily in objects; 2) a relationship feature propagation module that efficiently explores the connections between relationships by considering heterophily in order to refine the relationship representation; 3) a heterophily-aware message-passing scheme to further distinguish the heterophily and homophily between objects/relationships, thereby facilitating improved message passing in graphs. We conducted extensive experiments on two public datasets: Visual Genome (VG) and Open Images (OI). The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HL-Net over existing state-of-the-art approaches. In more detail, HL-Net outperforms the second-best competitors by 2.1$\\%$ on the VG dataset for scene graph classification and 1.2$\\%$ on the IO dataset for the final score.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nDao, T., Chen, B., Sohoni, N.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/38 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nFor these applications, the causal self-attention-which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 4. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/46 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2204.02311, 2022.

Hardware-aware structured attention*\n\n*Chaojian Li, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Qixuan Yu, Yue Wang, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HW-NAS-Bench is developed, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW- NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NA research more reproducible and accessible and verify that dedicated device-specific HW- Nas can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.\n\n**Abstract:** HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-aware structured attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. STEP: Learning N: M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition\n\n*From Search Query: 2. Hardware-aware structured attention*\n\n*Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Chris De Sa, A. Yazdanbakhsh*\n\n**TL;DR:** STEP is proposed, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N: M masks (mask-learning phase).\n\n**Abstract:** Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. SimulSpeech: End-to-End Simultaneous Speech to Text Translation\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yi Ren, Jinglin Liu, Xu Tan, Chen Zhang, Tao Qin, Zhou Zhao, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments on MuST-C English-Spanish and English-German spoken language translation datasets show that SimulSpeech achieves reasonable BLEU scores and lower delay compared to full-sentence end-to-end speech to text translation (without simultaneous translation), and better performance than the two-stage cascaded simultaneous translation model in terms of BLEu scores and translation delay.\n\n**Abstract:** In this work, we develop SimulSpeech, an end-to-end simultaneous speech to text translation system which translates speech in source language to text in target language concurrently. SimulSpeech consists of a speech encoder, a speech segmenter and a text decoder, where 1) the segmenter builds upon the encoder and leverages a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) loss to split the input streaming speech in real time, 2) the encoder-decoder attention adopts a wait-k strategy for simultaneous translation. SimulSpeech is more challenging than previous cascaded systems (with simultaneous automatic speech recognition (ASR) and simultaneous neural machine translation (NMT)). We introduce two novel knowledge distillation methods to ensure the performance: 1) Attention-level knowledge distillation transfers the knowledge from the multiplication of the attention matrices of simultaneous NMT and ASR models to help the training of the attention mechanism in SimulSpeech; 2) Data-level knowledge distillation transfers the knowledge from the full-sentence NMT model and also reduces the complexity of data distribution to help on the optimization of SimulSpeech. Experiments on MuST-C English-Spanish and English-German spoken language translation datasets show that SimulSpeech achieves reasonable BLEU scores and lower delay compared to full-sentence end-to-end speech to text translation (without simultaneous translation), and better performance than the two-stage cascaded simultaneous translation model in terms of BLEU scores and translation delay.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 75  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 5. Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: 2. \"Hardware-efficient attention\" structured matrices*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 6.

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices.

Scheduled DropHead: A Regularization Method for Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" attention mechanisms*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Tao Ge, Ke Xu, Furu Wei, Ming Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce DropHead, a structured dropout method\nspecifically designed for regularizing the multi-head attention mechanism,\nwhich is a key component of transformer, a state-of-the-art model for various\nNLP tasks. In contrast to the conventional dropout mechanisms which randomly\ndrop units or connections, the proposed DropHead is a structured dropout\nmethod. It drops entire attention-heads during training and It prevents the\nmulti-head attention model from being dominated by a small portion of attention\nheads while also reduces the risk of overfitting the training data, thus making\nuse of the multi-head attention mechanism more efficiently. Motivated by recent\nstudies about the learning dynamic of the multi-head attention mechanism, we\npropose a specific dropout rate schedule to adaptively adjust the dropout rate\nof DropHead and achieve better regularization effect. Experimental results on\nboth machine translation and text classification benchmark datasets demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed approach.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-28T07:33:14Z  (*Updated: 2020-11-01T15:57:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Synthesizer: Rethinking Self-Attention in Transformer Models\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" attention mechanisms*\n\n*Yi Tay, Dara Bahri, Donald Metzler, Da-Cheng Juan, Zhe Zhao, Che Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The dot product self-attention is known to be central and indispensable to\nstate-of-the-art Transformer models. But is it really required? This paper\ninvestigates the true importance and contribution of the dot product-based\nself-attention mechanism on the performance of Transformer models. Via\nextensive experiments, we find that (1) random alignment matrices surprisingly\nperform quite competitively and (2) learning attention weights from token-token\n(query-key) interactions is useful but not that important after all. To this\nend, we propose \\textsc{Synthesizer}, a model that learns synthetic attention\nweights without token-token interactions. In our experiments, we first show\nthat simple Synthesizers achieve highly competitive performance when compared\nagainst vanilla Transformer models across a range of tasks, including machine\ntranslation, language modeling, text generation and GLUE/SuperGLUE benchmarks.\nWhen composed with dot product attention, we find that Synthesizers\nconsistently outperform Transformers. Moreover, we conduct additional\ncomparisons of Synthesizers against Dynamic Convolutions, showing that simple\nRandom Synthesizer is not only $60\\%$ faster but also improves perplexity by a\nrelative $3.5\\%$. Finally, we show that simple factorized Synthesizers can\noutperform Linformers on encoding only tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-02T08:16:19Z  (*Updated: 2021-05-24T12:19:35Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: 2. \"Hardware-efficient attention\" structured matrices*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Unveiling and Harnessing Hidden Attention Sinks: Enhancing Large\n  Language Models without Training through Attention Calibration\n\n*From Search Query: 2. \"Hardware-efficient attention\" structured matrices*\n\n*Zhongzhi Yu, Zheng Wang, Yonggan Fu, Huihong Shi, Khalid Shaikh, Yingyan Celine Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a fundamental component behind the remarkable achievements of\nlarge language models (LLMs). However, our current understanding of the\nattention mechanism, especially regarding how attention distributions are\nestablished, remains limited. Inspired by recent studies that explore the\npresence of attention sink in the initial token, which receives\ndisproportionately large attention scores despite their lack of semantic\nimportance, this work delves deeper into this phenomenon. We aim to provide a\nmore profound understanding of the existence of attention sinks within LLMs and\nto uncover ways to enhance the achievable accuracy of LLMs by directly\noptimizing the attention distributions, without the need for weight finetuning.\nSpecifically, this work begins with comprehensive visualizations of the\nattention distributions in LLMs during inference across various inputs and\ntasks. Based on these visualizations, to the best of our knowledge, we are the\nfirst to discover that (1) attention sinks occur not only at the start of\nsequences but also within later tokens of the input, and (2) not all attention\nsinks have a positive impact on the achievable accuracy of LLMs. Building upon\nour findings, we propose a training-free Attention Calibration Technique (ACT)\nthat automatically optimizes the attention distributions on the fly during\ninference in an input-adaptive manner. Extensive experiments validate that ACT\nconsistently enhances the accuracy of various LLMs across different\napplications. Specifically, ACT achieves an average improvement of up to 7.30%\nin accuracy across different datasets when applied to Llama-30B.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture\n\n*From Search Query: 1. Monarch matrices in attention*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Michael Poli, Benjamin Spector, Armin W. Thomas, Sabri Eyuboglu, Isys Johnson, Jessica Grogan, Simran Arora, Daniel Y. Fu*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Conference:** monarch-mixer-a-simple-sub-quadratic-gemm\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 2.

However, the emergence of transformers has altered this paradigm due to their superior performance. Built upon these advances, transformers have conjoined CNNs as two leading foundational models for learning visual representations. However, transformers are hindered by the $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ complexity of their attention mechanisms, while CNNs lack global receptive fields and dynamic weight allocation. State Space Models (SSMs), specifically the \\textit{\\textbf{Mamba}} model with selection mechanisms and hardware-aware architecture, have garnered immense interest lately in sequential modeling and visual representation learning, challenging the dominance of transformers by providing infinite context lengths and offering substantial efficiency maintaining linear complexity in the input sequence. Capitalizing on the advances in computer vision, medical imaging has heralded a new epoch with Mamba models. Intending to help researchers navigate the surge, this survey seeks to offer an encyclopedic review of Mamba models in medical imaging. Specifically, we start with a comprehensive theoretical review forming the basis of SSMs, including Mamba architecture and its alternatives for sequence modeling paradigms in this context. Next, we offer a structured classification of Mamba models in the medical field and introduce a diverse categorization scheme based on their application, imaging modalities, and targeted organs. Finally, we summarize key challenges, discuss different future research directions of the SSMs in the medical domain, and propose several directions to fulfill the demands of this field.

Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: 2. \"Hardware-efficient attention\" structured matrices*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Tri Dao, Atri Rudra, Zhao Song, Jiaming Yang, Kaizhao Liang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Conference:** pixelated-butterfly-simple-and-efficient\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that incorporates hardware-aware structured matrix designs, particularly using Monarch matrices, here are the key points and useful information extracted from the provided analysis and references:\n\n## Novelty Verification and Comparison with Existing Models\n\n- The researcher needs to verify if applying Monarch matrices to FastTTTLinear is novel or if it overlaps with existing work like Monarch Mixer.

For example, Monarch Mixer matches GPT-style Transformers in pretraining perplexity while being sub-quadratic in sequence length and model dimension.\n  - **FlashAttention-2** also offers better work partitioning and achieves around 2\u00d7 speedup compared to FlashAttention, highlighting the importance of efficient parallelism and work partitioning.\n\n## Implementation Feasibility\n\n- Integrating Monarch matrices into FastTTTLinear involves addressing challenges such as matrix initialization, training stability, and compatibility with existing layers.\n  - **Key Insight:** Ensuring causality, which is addressed in Monarch Mixer through multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, is crucial. The proposal must clarify how it handles causality within FastTTTLinear.\n\n## Recent Advances and Empirical Results\n\n- The researcher should look for recent literature (post-2023) on hardware-aware structured attention mechanisms that utilize structured matrices like Monarch, Butterfly, or block-diagonal matrices.\n  - **Key Insight:** Recent works such as \"Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\" provide insights into using structured matrices like Block Tensor-Train (BTT) which perform better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n## Search Plan and Keywords\n\nTo refine the search, the following keywords and search descriptions can be used:\n\n### External Search Keywords\n```keywords\n1. \"Monarch matrices\" attention mechanisms\n2. \"Hardware-efficient attention\" structured matrices\n3. \"FastTTTLinear\" Monarch matrices\n4. \"Structured attention mechanisms\" recent advances\n5. \"Causality enforcement\" in structured attention\n```\n\n### Internal Library Search Description\n```description\nSearch for recent research papers (post-2023) and prior design proposals that focus on integrating Monarch matrices or similar hardware-aware structured matrices into attention mechanisms within FastTTTLinear or related GAU architectures.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 43  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/51 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nDao, T., Chen, B., Sohoni, N.

Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/46 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2204.02311, 2022.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" test-time training models*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 2. Test-Time Prompt Tuning for Zero-Shot Generalization in Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" test-time training models*\n\n*Manli Shu, Weili Nie, De-An Huang, Zhiding Yu, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Chaowei Xiao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Test-time prompt tuning (TPT) is proposed, a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample and performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have shown promising zero-shot generalization in many downstream tasks with properly designed text prompts. Instead of relying on hand-engineered prompts, recent works learn prompts using the training data from downstream tasks. While effective, training on domain-specific data reduces a model's generalization capability to unseen new domains. In this work, we propose test-time prompt tuning (TPT), a method that can learn adaptive prompts on the fly with a single test sample. For image classification, TPT optimizes the prompt by minimizing the entropy with confidence selection so that the model has consistent predictions across different augmented views of each test sample. In evaluating generalization to natural distribution shifts, TPT improves the zero-shot top-1 accuracy of CLIP by 3.6% on average, surpassing previous prompt tuning approaches that require additional task-specific training data. In evaluating cross-dataset generalization with unseen categories, TPT performs on par with the state-of-the-art approaches that use additional training data.

Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" test-time training models*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 57*)\n\n#### 4. Algorithm and Hardness for Dynamic Attention Maintenance in Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: 3. \"Structured matrices\" in TTT language models*\n\n*Jan van den Brand, Zhao Song, Tianyi Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false, and there is no algorithm that can use both the amortized update time and the worst-case query time of the proposed algorithm.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have made fundamental changes in human life. The attention scheme is one of the key components over all the LLMs, such as BERT, GPT-1, Transformers, GPT-2, 3, 3.5 and 4. Inspired by previous theoretical study of static version of the attention multiplication problem [Zandieh, Han, Daliri, and Karbasi arXiv 2023, Alman and Song arXiv 2023]. In this work, we formally define a dynamic version of attention matrix multiplication problem. There are matrices $Q,K, V \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$, they represent query, key and value in LLMs. In each iteration we update one entry in $K$ or $V$. In the query stage, we receive $(i,j) \\in [n] \\times [d]$ as input, and want to answer $(D^{-1} A V)_{i,j}$, where $A:=\\exp(QK^\\top) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a square matrix and $D := \\mathrm{diag}(A {\\bf 1}_n) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$ is a diagonal matrix. Here ${\\bf 1}_n$ denote a length-$n$ vector that all the entries are ones. We provide two results: an algorithm and a conditional lower bound. $\\bullet$ On one hand, inspired by the lazy update idea from [Demetrescu and Italiano FOCS 2000, Sankowski FOCS 2004, Cohen, Lee and Song STOC 2019, Brand SODA 2020], we provide a data-structure that uses $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau)-\\tau})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau})$ worst-case query time. $\\bullet$ On the other hand, show that unless the hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture [Brand, Nanongkai and Saranurak FOCS 2019] is false, there is no algorithm that can use both $O(n^{\\omega(1,1,\\tau) - \\tau- \\Omega(1)})$ amortized update time, and $O(n^{1+\\tau-\\Omega(1)})$ worst query time. In conclusion, our algorithmic result is conditionally optimal unless hinted matrix vector multiplication conjecture is false.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 29  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. A Statistical Framework for Low-bitwidth Training of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: 5. \"Hardware-aware TTT mechanisms\" neural networks*\n\n*Jianfei Chen, Yujie Gai, Z. Yao, Michael W. Mahoney, Joseph E. Gonzalez*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the FQT gradient is an unbiased estimator of the QAT gradient, and the impact of gradient quantization on its variance is discussed, and two novel gradient quantizers are developed that have smaller variance than the existing per-tensor quantizer.\n\n**Abstract:** Fully quantized training (FQT), which uses low-bitwidth hardware by quantizing the activations, weights, and gradients of a neural network model, is a promising approach to accelerate the training of deep neural networks. One major challenge with FQT is the lack of theoretical understanding, in particular of how gradient quantization impacts convergence properties. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a statistical framework for analyzing FQT algorithms. We view the quantized gradient of FQT as a stochastic estimator of its full precision counterpart, a procedure known as quantization-aware training (QAT). We show that the FQT gradient is an unbiased estimator of the QAT gradient, and we discuss the impact of gradient quantization on its variance. Inspired by these theoretical results, we develop two novel gradient quantizers, and we show that these have smaller variance than the existing per-tensor quantizer. For training ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our 5-bit block Householder quantizer achieves only 0.5% validation accuracy loss relative to QAT, comparable to the existing INT8 baseline.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 6.

Unlike existing steganography schemes which treat the DNN parameters as bit strings, Cans for the first time exploits the learning capacity of the carrier model via a novel parameter sharing mechanism. Extensive evaluation shows, Cans is the first working scheme which can covertly transmit over 10000 real-world data samples within a carrier model which has 220 \u00d7 less parameters than the total size of the stolen data, and simultaneously transmit multiple heterogeneous datasets within a single carrier model, under a trivial distortion rate ( < 10 \u2212 5 ) and with almost no utility loss on the carrier model ( < 1% ). Besides, Cans implements by-design redundancy to be resilient against common post-processing techniques on the carrier model before the publishing.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. PackQViT: Faster Sub-8-bit Vision Transformers via Full and Packed Quantization on the Mobile\n\n*From Search Query: 5. \"Hardware-aware TTT mechanisms\" neural networks*\n\n*Peiyan Dong, Lei Lu, Chao Wu, Cheng Lyu, Geng Yuan, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** An activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making and develops a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT Acceleration on mobile phones.\n\n**Abstract:** While Vision Transformers (ViTs) have undoubtedly made impressive strides in computer vision (CV), their intricate network structures necessitate substantial computation and memory resources. A decision-making process for CV tasks typically entails performing computations with low latency, which is a tricky problem for ViT models. Model quantization is a widely-used technique to optimize the hardware ef\ufb01ciency of deep neural networks. Full quantization under Sub-8-bit precision, in particular, is a promising solution to reduce inference latency significantly. Unfortunately, current commodity hardware, such as CPUs and GPUs, still struggles to ef\ufb01ciently execute these sub-8-bit quantized networks, as their SIMD instructions only support a granularity of 8 bits or wider. Also, there is a scarcity of literature that presents a full quantization paradigm for ViTs. In this paper, we propose an activation-aware fully sub-8-bit quantization-aware training (QAT) framework called PackQViT for ef\ufb01cient yet accurate ViT acceleration on mobile devices to facilitate real-time AI-powered decision-making. Speci\ufb01cally, in revisiting data activation within the ViT data\ufb02ow, two characteristics are relevant to quantization strategy and precision: the long-tailed distribution and systematic channel-wise outliers. In response, we employ either log2 quantization or clipping to address the long-tailed distribution and incorporate outlier-aware training for residual link quantization to regulate the various channel-wise outliers more consistently. Notably, due to the systematic \ufb01xed pattern, outlier-aware training approach can predict the channel indices and regularized scales of outliers in advance, thus avoiding the runtime data-adaptive selection during inference. Furthermore, we employ Int-2 n -Softmax, Int-LayerNorm, and Integer GELU to enable integer-only computation \ufb02ow. Finally, we develop a SIMD-based 4-bit packed multiplier to achieve end-to-end ViT acceleration on mobile phones. Compared to prior studies on ViT quantization using 8-bit precision, PackQViT surpasses other works by an improved accuracy ranging from 0.4% to 17.9% for various widely used ViTs on ImageNet dataset; under 4-bit precision, PackQViT demonstrates 0.4% \u21e0 2.8% higher accuracy. Compared to the baseline multiplier, our implementations on the Realme GT Android smartphone with Snapdragon 870 SoC CPU achieve 2 . 6 \u21e5\u21e0 3 . 7 \u21e5 speedup under 8-bit scenario and 3 . 8 \u21e5\u21e0 5 . 9 \u21e5 speedup under 4-bit which ensures practical real-time performance.

How do Large Language Models Learn In-Context? Query and Key Matrices of\n  In-Context Heads are Two Towers for Metric Learning\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" test-time training models*\n\n*Zeping Yu, Sophia Ananiadou*\n\n**Abstract:** We investigate the mechanism of in-context learning (ICL) on sentence\nclassification tasks with semantically-unrelated labels (\"foo\"/\"bar\"). We find\nintervening in only 1\\% heads (named \"in-context heads\") significantly affects\nICL accuracy from 87.6\\% to 24.4\\%. To understand this phenomenon, we analyze\nthe value-output vectors in these heads and discover that the vectors at each\nlabel position contain substantial information about the corresponding labels.\nFurthermore, we observe that the prediction shift from \"foo\" to \"bar\" is due to\nthe respective reduction and increase in these heads' attention scores at \"foo\"\nand \"bar\" positions. Therefore, we propose a hypothesis for ICL: in in-context\nheads, the value-output matrices extract label features, while the query-key\nmatrices compute the similarity between the features at the last position and\nthose at each label position. The query and key matrices can be considered as\ntwo towers that learn the similarity metric between the last position's\nfeatures and each demonstration at label positions. Using this hypothesis, we\nexplain the majority label bias and recency bias in ICL and propose two methods\nto reduce these biases by 22\\% and 17\\%, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-05T10:39:32Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-24T20:27:53Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. QuIP: 2-Bit Quantization of Large Language Models With Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: 1. \"Monarch matrices\" test-time training models*\n\n*Jerry Chee, Yaohui Cai, Volodymyr Kuleshov, Christopher De Sa*\n\n**Abstract:** This work studies post-training parameter quantization in large language\nmodels (LLMs). We introduce quantization with incoherence processing (QuIP), a\nnew method based on the insight that quantization benefits from\n$\\textit{incoherent}$ weight and Hessian matrices, i.e., from the weights being\neven in magnitude and the directions in which it is important to round them\naccurately being unaligned with the coordinate axes. QuIP consists of two\nsteps: (1) an adaptive rounding procedure minimizing a quadratic proxy\nobjective; (2) efficient pre- and post-processing that ensures weight and\nHessian incoherence via multiplication by random orthogonal matrices. We\ncomplement QuIP with the first theoretical analysis for an LLM-scale\nquantization algorithm, and show that our theory also applies to an existing\nmethod, OPTQ. Empirically, we find that our incoherence preprocessing improves\nseveral existing quantization algorithms and yields the first LLM quantization\nmethods that produce viable results using only two bits per weight.

Together with a subsequent\ndimensionality reduction algorithm, topic models can be used for deriving\nspatializations for text corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots, reflecting\nsemantic similarity between the documents and supporting corpus analysis.\nAlthough the choice of the topic model, the dimensionality reduction, and their\nunderlying hyperparameters significantly impact the resulting layout, it is\nunknown which particular combinations result in high-quality layouts with\nrespect to accuracy and perception metrics. To investigate the effectiveness of\ntopic models and dimensionality reduction methods for the spatialization of\ncorpora as two-dimensional scatter plots (or basis for landscape-type\nvisualizations), we present a large-scale, benchmark-based computational\nevaluation. Our evaluation consists of (1) a set of corpora, (2) a set of\nlayout algorithms that are combinations of topic models and dimensionality\nreductions, and (3) quality metrics for quantifying the resulting layout. The\ncorpora are given as document-term matrices, and each document is assigned to a\nthematic class. The chosen metrics quantify the preservation of local and\nglobal properties and the perceptual effectiveness of the two-dimensional\nscatter plots. By evaluating the benchmark on a computing cluster, we derived a\nmultivariate dataset with over 45 000 individual layouts and corresponding\nquality metrics. Based on the results, we propose guidelines for the effective\ndesign of text spatializations that are based on topic models and\ndimensionality reductions. As a main result, we show that interpretable topic\nmodels are beneficial for capturing the structure of text corpora. We\nfurthermore recommend the use of t-SNE as a subsequent dimensionality\nreduction.\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17T14:08:25Z  (*Updated: 2023-07-17T14:08:25Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7.

However, their abilities in\nspatial reasoning, a crucial aspect of human cognition, remain relatively\nunexplored. Human possess a remarkable ability to create mental images of\nunseen objects and actions through a process known as the Mind's Eye, enabling\nthe imagination of the unseen world. Inspired by this cognitive capacity, we\npropose Visualization-of-Thought (VoT) prompting. VoT aims to elicit spatial\nreasoning of LLMs by visualizing their reasoning traces, thereby guiding\nsubsequent reasoning steps. We employed VoT for multi-hop spatial reasoning\ntasks, including natural language navigation, visual navigation, and visual\ntiling in 2D grid worlds. Experimental results demonstrated that VoT\nsignificantly enhances the spatial reasoning abilities of LLMs. Notably, VoT\noutperformed existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) in these tasks.\nWhile VoT works surprisingly well on LLMs, the ability to generate mental\nimages to facilitate spatial reasoning resembles the mind's eye process,\nsuggesting its potential viability in MLLMs. Please find the dataset and codes\nat https://microsoft.github.io/visualization-of-thought\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-04T17:45:08Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-23T07:20:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 9. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States\n\n*From Search Query: 5. \"Hardware-aware TTT mechanisms\" neural networks*\n\n*Yu Sun, Xinhao Li, Karan Dalal, Jiarui Xu, Arjun Vikram, Genghan Zhang, Yann Dubois, Xinlei Chen, Xiaolong Wang, Sanmi Koyejo, Tatsunori Hashimoto, Carlos Guestrin*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention performs well in long context but has quadratic complexity.\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long\ncontext is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a\nnew class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive\nhidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model\nitself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the\nhidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are\ncalled Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations:\nTTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer\nMLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B\nparameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both\nTTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer,\nthey can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba\ncannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is\nalready faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock\ntime. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential\nin long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-05T16:23:20Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-11T00:42:18Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 10. Mechanisms of Artistic Creativity in Deep Learning Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: 5. \"Hardware-aware TTT mechanisms\" neural networks*\n\n*Lonce Wyse*\n\n**Abstract:** The generative capabilities of deep learning neural networks (DNNs) have been\nattracting increasing attention for both the remarkable artifacts they produce,\nbut also because of the vast conceptual difference between how they are\nprogrammed and what they do. DNNs are 'black boxes' where high-level behavior\nis not explicitly programmed, but emerges from the complex interactions of\nthousands or millions of simple computational elements. Their behavior is often\ndescribed in anthropomorphic terms that can be misleading, seem magical, or\nstoke fears of an imminent singularity in which machines become 'more' than\nhuman. In this paper, we examine 5 distinct behavioral characteristics\nassociated with creativity, and provide an example of a mechanisms from\ngenerative deep learning architectures that give rise to each these\ncharacteristics. All 5 emerge from machinery built for purposes other than the\ncreative characteristics they exhibit, mostly classification. These mechanisms\nof creative generative capabilities thus demonstrate a deep kinship to\ncomputational perceptual processes. By understanding how these different\nbehaviors arise, we hope to on one hand take the magic out of anthropomorphic\ndescriptions, but on the other, to build a deeper appreciation of machinic\nforms of creativity on their own terms that will allow us to nurture their\nfurther development.\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-30T05:29:38Z  (*Updated: 2019-06-30T05:29:38Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goals outlined in the **HardwareOptimizedFastTTTLinear** proposal, here are the key points and the most relevant information from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Novelty Verification and Comparison with Existing Models\n\n- The proposal aims to integrate Monarch matrices into the FastTTTLinear architecture, which is a novel application if it can be shown to maintain or enhance test-time training (TTT) capabilities without compromising causality or training stability.\n  - **Monarch Mixer** has already utilized Monarch matrices in a Transformer architecture, achieving sub-quadratic scaling and addressing causality through novel parameterizations.\n  - The uniqueness of the proposal lies in its application to FastTTTLinear, which needs to be differentiated from existing work like Monarch Mixer and FlashAttention.\n\n## Efficiency, Scalability, and Hardware Utilization\n\n- **Monarch matrices** are designed to be hardware-efficient, enabling fast and memory-efficient training of neural networks.

The design combines hardware-efficient butterfly patterns with learnable permutations to enable fast matrix operations while maintaining model expressivity. This approach significantly reduces computational complexity and memory requirements through structured sparsity and efficient recursive algorithms, making it particularly well-suited for modern hardware architectures.",
