(2023) have implemented fast and slow streams for efficient sequence learning.\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Hierarchical Transformers and models like **Pinto et al. (2024)** and **Tian et al. (2023)** have employed hierarchical structures to capture multi-scale dependencies.\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: Techniques for adaptive compression in state-space models have been explored in works like **Hasani et al. (2022)** and **Jayakumar et al. (2020)**.\n\nFurthermore, sibling designs such as **compressivehierarchicalttt** and **sparsekeyfasttttlinear** have modified **FastTTTLinear** with similar hierarchical and compressive mechanisms.\n\nTherefore, the proposal does not introduce significantly new concepts or methods beyond what is already present in the literature and previous designs. Consequently, its novelty and meaningfulness are limited unless it demonstrates unique integrations or substantial improvements over existing models.\n\n---\n\n**Highlights (Strengths)**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Integration**:\n\n   - The proposal thoughtfully combines hierarchical processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression to address challenges in processing long sequences efficiently.\n\n2. **Alignment with Current Research Trends**:\n\n   - It aligns with ongoing efforts in the research community to improve efficiency and scalability in language models, particularly for long-sequence processing.\n\n3. **Focus on Efficiency and Scalability**:\n\n   - By aiming to manage memory efficiently and capture both local and global dependencies, the proposal addresses key concerns in large-scale language modeling.\n\n---\n\n**Concerns**\n\n1. **Lack of Novelty**:\n\n   - The core components of the proposal have been previously explored individually and in combination within other models. The proposal does not provide a clear differentiation or unique contribution compared to existing research and prior designs.\n\n2. **Implementation Complexity**:\n\n   - Integrating multiple advanced mechanisms may introduce significant complexity, increasing the risk of implementation challenges, training instability, and difficulty in optimization.\n\n3. **Absence of Empirical Evidence**:\n\n   - Without empirical results or theoretical analyses demonstrating significant improvements over existing models, it is challenging to assess the practical benefits and potential impact.\n\n4. **Overlap with Sibling Designs**:\n\n   - The proposal shares substantial similarities with previous designs like **compressivehierarchicalttt**, raising concerns about duplication rather than innovation.\n\n---\n\n**Evaluation**\n\n1. **Clarity (4/5)**:\n\n   - The proposal is well-written, with clear objectives and detailed descriptions of the proposed modifications, including mathematical formulations and pseudo-code.

It does not introduce new methodologies or unique combinations that offer a clear advantage over existing models.\n\n3. **Feasibility (3.5/5)**:\n\n   - While the implementation appears feasible, the added complexity from integrating multiple mechanisms could pose practical challenges in terms of training stability and computational efficiency.\n\n4. **Scalability (3.5/5)**:\n\n   - The design intends to improve scalability by efficiently handling long sequences. However, similar scalability benefits are already achieved by existing models using hierarchical attention and linear attention mechanisms.\n\n5. **Accuracy and Robustness (3/5)**:\n\n   - Potential improvements in capturing local and global dependencies may enhance performance. However, without empirical evidence, it is uncertain whether the proposed modifications will significantly improve accuracy or robustness over existing models.\n\n6. **Efficiency (3.5/5)**:\n\n   - The proposal aims to improve computational efficiency and memory usage through adaptive compression and hierarchical processing.

A more focused approach may lead to clearer contributions and easier implementation.\n\n4. **Address Implementation Challenges**:\n\n   - Discuss potential challenges in training and optimization, and propose strategies to mitigate them, such as techniques to prevent gradient instability in dual-stream architectures.\n\n5. **Incorporate Hardware-Efficient Strategies**:\n\n   - Explore hardware-efficient implementations and IO-aware algorithms to enhance the practicality and differentiation of the proposal.\n\n6. **Differentiate from Sibling Designs**:\n\n   - Explicitly compare the proposal to sibling designs like **compressivehierarchicalttt**, highlighting distinct features, methodological differences, or areas where the proposal offers improvements.\n\n---\n\n**Final Rating**\n\n```rating 3.0```\n\n---\n\n**Justification for Rating**\n\nThe **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** proposal offers a comprehensive integration of hierarchical processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression within the **FastTTTLinear** GAU. However, due to significant overlap with existing research and prior designs, it lacks sufficient novelty. The absence of unique contributions, combined with potential implementation complexities and a lack of empirical evidence, limits the proposal's potential impact.\n\nTo elevate the proposal, it is essential to demonstrate clear differentiation from existing work, provide empirical results to substantiate the proposed benefits, and consider simplifying the design to focus on innovative aspects that offer tangible improvements over current models.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn its current form, the proposal does not meet the high standards required for approval. While it addresses important challenges in long-sequence processing and aligns with current research trends, the lack of novelty and supporting evidence make it difficult to justify its adoption. Further refinement, emphasizing unique contributions and providing empirical validation, is necessary to enhance the proposal's value and potential impact on the field.\n\n---",

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.88)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

HiP Attention: Sparse Sub-Quadratic Attention with Hierarchical Attention Pruning (Avg. Score: 0.21)\n\n*Heejun Lee, Geon Park, Youngwan Lee, Jina Kim, Wonyoung Jeong, Myeongjae Jeon, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP) is proposed, a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n**Abstract:** In modern large language models (LLMs), increasing sequence lengths is a crucial challenge for enhancing their comprehension and coherence in handling complex tasks such as multi-modal question answering. However, handling long context sequences with LLMs is prohibitively costly due to the conventional attention mechanism's quadratic time and space complexity, and the context window size is limited by the GPU memory. Although recent works have proposed linear and sparse attention mechanisms to address this issue, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train pre-trained models. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which simultaneously reduces the training and inference time complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T \\log T)$ and the space complexity from $O(T^2)$ to $O(T)$. To this end, we devise a dynamic sparse attention mechanism that generates an attention mask through a novel tree-search-like algorithm for a given query on the fly. HiP is training-free as it only utilizes the pre-trained attention scores to spot the positions of the top-$k$ most significant elements for each query. Moreover, it ensures that no token is overlooked, unlike the sliding window-based sub-quadratic attention methods, such as StreamingLLM. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that HiP significantly reduces prompt (i.e., prefill) and decoding latency and memory usage while maintaining high generation performance with little or no degradation. As HiP allows pretrained LLMs to scale to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs with no additional engineering due to its easy plug-and-play deployment, we believe that our work will have a large practical impact, opening up the possibility to many long-context LLM applications previously infeasible.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/44 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nURL http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12950. 1\n[35] Tay, Y., Bahri, D., Yang, L., Metzler, D., and Juan, D.-C.

COLA: Orchestrating Error Coding and Learning for Robust Neural Network Inference Against Hardware Defects\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Anlan Yu, Ning Lyu, Jieming Yin, Zhiyuan Yan, Wujie Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely COLA, which is proposed to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by adopting a separated architecture, and orthogonalizing weights in common DNN layers so that the intermediate features are Orthogonal with each other.\n\n**Abstract:** Error correcting output codes (ECOCs) have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against hardware defects of DNN hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, existing efforts suffer from drawbacks that would greatly impact their practicality: 1) robust accuracy (with defects) improvement at the cost of degraded clean accuracy (without defects); 2) no guarantee on better robust or clean accuracy using stronger ECOCs. In this paper, we first shed light on the connection between these drawbacks and error correlation, and then propose a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely COLA . Specifically, we propose to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by 1) adopting a separated architecture, where the last portions of the paths to all output nodes are separated, and 2) orthogonalizing weights in common DNN layers so that the intermediate features are orthogonal with each other. We also propose a regularization technique based on total correlation to mitigate overall error correlation at the outputs. The effectiveness of COLA is first analyzed theoretically, and then evaluated experimentally, e.g., up to 6 . 7% clean accuracy improvement compared with the original DNNs and up to 40% robust accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art ECOC-enhanced DNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Linear Symmetric Quantization of Neural Networks for Low-precision Integer Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Xiandong Zhao, Ying Wang, Xuyi Cai, Cheng Liu, Lei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors is proposed, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators and multipliers.\n\n**Abstract:** With the proliferation of specialized neural network processors that operate on low-precision integers, the performance of Deep Neural Network inference becomes increasingly dependent on the result of quantization. Despite plenty of prior work on the quantization of weights or activations for neural networks, there is still a wide gap between the software quantizers and the low-precision accelerator implementation, which degrades either the efficiency of networks or that of the hardware for the lack of software and hardware coordination at design-phase. In this paper, we propose a learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators (e.g., 16-bit) and multipliers (e.g., 4-bit). We use a unified way to quantize weights and activations, and the results outperform many previous approaches for various networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and lightweight models like MobileNet while keeping friendly to the accelerator architecture. Additional, we also apply the method to object detection models and witness high performance and accuracy in YOLO-v2. Finally, we deploy the quantized models on our specialized integer-arithmetic-only DNN accelerator to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizer. We show that even with linear symmetric quantization, the results can be better than asymmetric or non-linear methods in 4-bit networks. In evaluation, the proposed quantizer induces less than 0.4\\% accuracy drop in ResNet18, ResNet34, and AlexNet when quantizing the whole network as required by the integer processors.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 3. Stacked Filters Stationary Flow For Hardware-Oriented Acceleration Of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Yuechao Gao, Nianhong Liu, Shenmin Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A computation flow, stacked filters stationary flow (SFS), and a corresponding data encoding format, relative indexed compressed sparse filter format (CSF), to make the best of data sparsity, and simplify data handling at execution time is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** To address memory and computation resource limitations for hardware-oriented acceleration of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we present a computation flow, stacked filters stationary flow (SFS), and a corresponding data encoding format, relative indexed compressed sparse filter format (CSF), to make the best of data sparsity, and simplify data handling at execution time. And we also propose a three dimensional Single Instruction Multiple Data (3D-SIMD) processor architecture to illustrate how to accelerate deep CNNs by taking advantage of SFS flow and CSF format. Comparing with the state-of-the-art result (Han et al., 2016b), our methods achieve 1.11x improvement in reducing the storage required by AlexNet, and 1.09x improvement in reducing the storage required by SqueezeNet, without loss of accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. Moreover, using these approaches, chip area for logics handling irregular sparse data access can be saved. Comparing with the 2D-SIMD processor structures in DVAS, ENVISION, etc., our methods achieve about 3.65x processing element (PE) array utilization rate improvement (from 26.4\\% to 96.5\\%) on the data from Deep Compression on AlexNet.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

However, the best models require dedicated hardware for serving, which is costly and often not feasible. To avoid this serving-time requirement, we present a method of capturing up to 86% of the gains of a Transformer cross-attention model with a lexicalized scoring function that only requires 10-6% of the Transformer's FLOPs per document and can be served using commodity CPUs. When combined with a BM25 retriever, this approach matches the quality of a state-of-the art dual encoder retriever, that still requires an accelerator for query encoding. We introduce NAIL (Non-Autoregressive Indexing with Language models) as a model architecture that is compatible with recent encoder-decoder and decoder-only large language models, such as T5, GPT-3 and PaLM. This model architecture can leverage existing pre-trained checkpoints and can be fine-tuned for efficiently constructing document representations that do not require neural processing of queries.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SA-DS: A Dataset for Large Language Model-Driven AI Accelerator Design Generation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In the ever-evolving landscape of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) hardware acceleration, unlocking the true potential of systolic array accelerators has long been hindered by the daunting challenges of expertise and time investment. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution for automating code generation which is key to unlocking unprecedented efficiency and performance in various domains, including hardware descriptive code. The generative power of LLMs can enable the effective utilization of preexisting designs and dedicated hardware generators. However, the successful application of LLMs to hardware accelerator design is contingent upon the availability of specialized datasets tailored for this purpose. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Systolic Array-based Accelerator Data Set (SA-DS). SA-DS comprises a diverse collection of spatial array designs following the standardized Berkeley's Gemmini accelerator generator template, enabling design reuse, adaptation, and customization. SA-DS is intended to spark LLM-centered research on DNN hardware accelerator architecture. We envision that SA-DS provides a framework that will shape the course of DNN hardware acceleration research for generations to come.

FuSeConv: Fully Separable Convolutions for Fast Inference on Systolic Arrays\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Pratyush Kumar, Vinod Ganesan, Surya Selvam*\n\n**Abstract:** Both efficient neural networks and hardware accelerators are being explored to speed up DNN inference on edge devices. For example, MobileNet uses depthwise separable convolution to achieve much lower latency, while systolic arrays provide much higher performance per watt. Interestingly however, the combination of these two ideas is inefficient: The computational patterns of depth-wise separable convolution are not systolic and lack data reuse to saturate the systolic array's constrained dataflow. In this paper, we propose FuSeConv (Fully-Separable Convolution) as a drop-in replacement for depth-wise separable convolution. FuSeConv generalizes the decomposition of convolutions fully to separable 1D convolutions along spatial and depth dimensions. The resultant computation is systolic and efficiently utilizes the systolic array with a slightly modified dataflow. With FuSeConv, we achieve a significant speed-up of 3x-7x with the MobileNet family of networks on a systolic array of size 64x64, with comparable accuracy on the ImageNet dataset. The high speed-up motivates exploration of hardware-aware Neural Operator Search (NOS) in complement to ongoing efforts on Neural Architecture Search (NAS).\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 3. GraphACT: Accelerating GCN Training on CPU-FPGA Heterogeneous Platforms\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator neural architecture systolic array*\n\n*Viktor Prasanna, Hanqing Zeng*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have emerged as the state-of-the-art deep learning model for representation learning on graphs. It is challenging to accelerate training of GCNs, due to (1) substantial and irregular data communication to propagate information within the graph, and (2) intensive computation to propagate information along the neural network layers. To address these challenges, we design a novel accelerator for training GCNs on CPU-FPGA heterogeneous systems, by incorporating multiple algorithm-architecture co-optimizations. We first analyze the computation and communication characteristics of various GCN training algorithms, and select a subgraph-based algorithm that is well suited for hardware execution. To optimize the feature propagation within subgraphs, we propose a lightweight pre-processing step based on a graph theoretic approach. Such pre-processing performed on the CPU significantly reduces the memory access requirements and the computation to be performed on the FPGA. To accelerate the weight update in GCN layers, we propose a systolic array based design for efficient parallelization. We integrate the above optimizations into a complete hardware pipeline, and analyze its load-balance and resource utilization by accurate performance modeling. We evaluate our design on a Xilinx Alveo U200 board hosted by a 40-core Xeon server. On three large graphs, we achieve an order of magnitude training speedup with negligible accuracy loss, compared with state-of-the-art implementation on a multi-core platform.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using systolic array architectures, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Novel Attention Mechanisms Designed for Systolic Arrays\n\n- The paper on \"Integrated Accelerator based on NPU-PIM Unified Memory System\" discusses how transformer-based large language models (LLMs) can be optimized for systolic array architectures. It highlights the importance of efficient data manipulation in self-attention mechanisms, such as key transpose operations and splitting/merging attention heads. These optimizations are designed to minimize data reordering overhead and leverage on-chip DMA and streaming buffers to reduce latency.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Memory Hierarchy Optimizations\n\n- The same paper on \"Integrated Accelerator based on NPU-PIM Unified Memory System\" delves into the memory hierarchy optimizations. It describes the use of activation scratch-pad memory (AM) and weight scratch-pad memory (WM) with transposed data addressing layouts to fully exploit the benefits of the matrix unit\u2019s systolic array. This approach aligns the entry size of the AM with the corresponding dimension of the matrix unit\u2019s systolic array, optimizing data access and reducing off-chip memory accesses.\n\n## Accelerator-Aware Neural Architecture Design\n\n- The seminar on \"Topics in Electronic Design Automation\" touches on the importance of designing neural architectures with specific hardware capabilities in mind. It discusses how open-source architectures like RISC-V can be extended with custom matrix operations, which are crucial for deep learning computations. This approach can lead to more efficient and scalable designs, particularly when optimized for systolic arrays and other specialized hardware accelerators.\n\n- The \"IEEE ICCD 2024\" agenda includes sessions on hardware accelerators and memory architectures, such as \"TileMap: Mapping Multi-Head Attention on Spatial Accelerators with Tile-based Analysis.\" This session could provide insights into how multi-head attention mechanisms can be optimized for spatial accelerators, which are often based on systolic array architectures.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- The need for domain-specific accelerators with flexible data manipulation is emphasized in the context of transformer-based LLMs. This includes optimizing non-computing operations such as transpose and data reordering, which significantly impact the latency of self-attention mechanisms. By integrating these optimizations into the hardware design, researchers can achieve better performance and efficiency.\n\nBy focusing on these areas, researchers can develop novel attention mechanisms, optimize memory hierarchies, and design neural architectures that are specifically tailored to leverage the capabilities of systolic array architectures, thereby improving the overall performance and efficiency of autoregressive language models.\n",

Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 2. Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Not-So-CLEVR: Visual Relations Strain Feedforward Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Matthew Ricci, Junkyung Kim, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, it is argued that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** The robust and efficient recognition of visual relations in images is a hallmark of biological vision. Here, we argue that, despite recent progress in visual recognition, modern machine vision algorithms are severely limited in their ability to learn visual relations. Through controlled experiments, we demonstrate that visual-relation problems strain convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The networks eventually break altogether when rote memorization becomes impossible such as when the intra-class variability exceeds their capacity. We further show that another type of feedforward network, called a relational network (RN), which was shown to successfully solve seemingly difficult visual question answering (VQA) problems on the CLEVR datasets, suffers similar limitations. Motivated by the comparable success of biological vision, we argue that feedback mechanisms including working memory and attention are the key computational components underlying abstract visual reasoning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 20  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 2.

Walter*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory, which functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results on tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce a novel approach to endowing neural networks with emergent, long-term, large-scale memory. Distinct from strategies that connect neural networks to external memory banks via intricately crafted controllers and hand-designed attentional mechanisms, our memory is internal, distributed, co-located alongside computation, and implicitly addressed, while being drastically simpler than prior efforts. Architecting networks with multigrid structure and connectivity, while distributing memory cells alongside computation throughout this topology, we observe the emergence of coherent memory subsystems. Our hierarchical spatial organization, parameterized convolutionally, permits efficient instantiation of large-capacity memories, while multigrid topology provides short internal routing pathways, allowing convolutional networks to efficiently approximate the behavior of fully connected networks. Such networks have an implicit capacity for internal attention; augmented with memory, they learn to read and write specific memory locations in a dynamic data-dependent manner. We demonstrate these capabilities on exploration and mapping tasks, where our network is able to self-organize and retain long-term memory for trajectories of thousands of time steps. On tasks decoupled from any notion of spatial geometry: sorting, associative recall, and question answering, our design functions as a truly generic memory and yields excellent results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis with Gated Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Wei Xue, Tao Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient, and the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity.\n\n**Abstract:** Aspect based sentiment analysis (ABSA) can provide more detailed information than general sentiment analysis, because it aims to predict the sentiment polarities of the given aspects or entities in text. We summarize previous approaches into two subtasks: aspect-category sentiment analysis (ACSA) and aspect-term sentiment analysis (ATSA). Most previous approaches employ long short-term memory and attention mechanisms to predict the sentiment polarity of the concerned targets, which are often complicated and need more training time. We propose a model based on convolutional neural networks and gating mechanisms, which is more accurate and efficient. First, the novel Gated Tanh-ReLU Units can selectively output the sentiment features according to the given aspect or entity. The architecture is much simpler than attention layer used in the existing models. Second, the computations of our model could be easily parallelized during training, because convolutional layers do not have time dependency as in LSTM layers, and gating units also work independently. The experiments on SemEval datasets demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 511  (*Influential: 63*)\n\n#### 4. AtMan: Understanding Transformer Predictions Through Memory Efficient Attention Manipulation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Mayukh Deb, Bjorn Deiseroth, Samuel Weinbach, Manuel Brack, P. Schramowski, K. Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space.

Ahmed*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory that achieves state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural Processes (NPs) are popular meta-learning methods for efficiently modelling predictive uncertainty. Recent state-of-the-art methods, however, leverage expensive attention mechanisms, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes (CMANPs), an NP variant that only requires constant memory. To do so, we first propose an efficient update operation for Cross Attention. Leveraging the update operation, we propose Constant Memory Attention Block (CMAB), a novel attention block that (i) is permutation invariant, (ii) computes its output in constant memory, and (iii) performs constant computation updates. Finally, building on CMAB, we detail Constant Memory Attentive Neural Processes. Empirically, we show CMANPs achieve state-of-the-art results on popular NP benchmarks while being significantly more memory efficient than prior methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. RWKV: Reinventing RNNs for the Transformer Era\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Qinghua Zhou, Stanislaw Wozniak, Guangyu Song, Jiaju Lin, Stella Biderman, Rui-Jie Zhu, Jian Zhu, Peng Zhou, Qihang Zhao, Zhenyuan Zhang, Ruichong Zhang, Johan S.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, thus parallelizing computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference. We scale our models as large as 14 billion parameters, by far the largest dense RNN ever trained, and find RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-22\n\n\n\n#### 2. Mutual Information Scaling and Expressive Power of Sequence Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Huitao Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequence models assign probabilities to variable-length sequences such as natural language texts. The ability of sequence models to capture temporal dependence can be characterized by the temporal scaling of correlation and mutual information. In this paper, we study the mutual information of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) including long short-term memories and self-attention networks such as Transformers. Through a combination of theoretical study of linear RNNs and empirical study of nonlinear RNNs, we find their mutual information decays exponentially in temporal distance. On the other hand, Transformers can capture long-range mutual information more efficiently, making them preferable in modeling sequences with slow power-law mutual information, such as natural languages and stock prices. We discuss the connection of these results with statistical mechanics. We also point out the non-uniformity problem in many natural language datasets. We hope this work provides a new perspective in understanding the expressive power of sequence models and shed new light on improving the architecture of them.\n\n**Published:** 2019-05-10\n\n\n\n#### 3. GhostFaceNets: Lightweight Face Recognition Model From Cheap Operations\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Naoufel Werghi, Yahya Zweiri, Abdulhadi Shoufan, Sajid Javed, Oussama Abdul Hay, Mohamad Alansari*\n\n**Abstract:** The development of deep learning-based biometric models that can be deployed on devices with constrained memory and computational resources has proven to be a significant challenge. Previous approaches to this problem have not prioritized the reduction of feature map redundancy, but the introduction of Ghost modules represents a major innovation in this area. Ghost modules use a series of inexpensive linear transformations to extract additional feature maps from a set of intrinsic features, allowing for a more comprehensive representation of the underlying information. GhostNetV1 and GhostNetV2, both of which are based on Ghost modules, serve as the foundation for a group of lightweight face recognition models called GhostFaceNets. GhostNetV2 expands upon the original GhostNetV1 by adding an attention mechanism to capture long-range dependencies. Evaluation of GhostFaceNets using various benchmarks reveals that these models offer superior performance while requiring a computational complexity of approximately 60\u2013275 MFLOPs. This is significantly lower than that of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) big convolutional neural network (CNN) models, which can require hundreds of millions of FLOPs. GhostFaceNets trained with the ArcFace loss on the refined MS-Celeb-1M dataset demonstrate SOTA performance on all benchmarks. In comparison to previous SOTA mobile CNNs, GhostFaceNets greatly improve efficiency for face verification tasks. The GhostFaceNets code is available at: https://github.com/HamadYA/GhostFaceNets .\n\n**Proceeding:** ieee-access-2023-4\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on memory-efficient attention mechanisms and state management, here are some key findings and techniques from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Techniques for Reducing Memory Footprint of Attention\n\n### FlashAttention\nThe FlashAttention algorithm is a significant advancement in reducing the memory footprint of attention mechanisms. It employs two primary techniques: tiling and recomputation. Tiling involves dividing large matrices into smaller blocks to reduce memory usage during the forward pass, while recomputation avoids storing large intermediate matrices by recalculating the attention matrix during the backward pass. This approach achieves a 2-4x speedup and significant memory savings.\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nNAMMs introduce a learned network for memory management that improves both the performance and efficiency of transformers. By conditioning on the values in the produced attention matrices, NAMMs can reduce the input contexts to a fraction of their original sizes, thereby reducing memory usage. This method allows individual layers and attention heads to focus on the most relevant information, leading to substantial performance improvements across various benchmarks.\n\n## Efficient Intermediate State Management\n\n### Shared Attention Mechanism\nThe Shared Attention mechanism, as seen in SwiftFormer, reduces both computational and memory overhead by sharing pre-computed attention weights across multiple layers. This approach ensures that the model does not need to compute and store attention weights for each layer individually, leading to improved efficiency, especially on resource-constrained devices.\n\n### Backward Attention Memory Models (BAM)\nBAM introduces a design where an initial self-attention layer with a counter-causal mask allows for distinguishing between older and newer tokens. This architecture enables parameter-efficient sharing of information and helps in preventing redundancies in the KV cache, which is crucial for efficient intermediate state management.\n\n## Memory-Hierarchy Aware Neural Architectures\n\n### Memristor-Based Accelerators\nThe use of memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer networks. By integrating computation into memory using memristor crossbar arrays, this design reduces power consumption and latency. This approach is particularly beneficial for long-context tasks, as it minimizes data movement and optimizes matrix operations.\n\n### Hardware-Specific Optimizations\nOptimizing neural architectures with hardware-specific considerations is crucial. Techniques such as simplifying non-linear operations, leveraging linear and sparse operations, and designing models with regular computation patterns for systolic arrays can lead to significant efficiency gains. For example, MA-BERT achieves reductions in inference time by eliminating complex non-linear functions, highlighting the importance of hardware-software co-design [Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, the following techniques and architectures are promising for improving memory efficiency and state management in autoregressive language models:\n\n- **FlashAttention**: Tiling and recomputation to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity.\n- **NAMMs**: Learned memory management to reduce input contexts and focus on relevant information.\n- **Shared Attention Mechanism**: Sharing pre-computed attention weights across layers to reduce overhead.\n- **BAM**: Efficient sharing of information using counter-causal masks to prevent redundancies.\n- **Memristor-Based Accelerators**: Integrating computation into memory to optimize matrix operations and reduce data movement.\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Simplifying non-linear operations and leveraging linear and sparse operations for better hardware utilization.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg. Score: 0.34)\n\n*Simran Arora, Sabri Eyuboglu, Michael Zhang, Aman Timalsina, Silas Alberti, Dylan Zinsley, James Zou, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 17  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** To make BASED competitive, IO-aware algorithms are developed that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has shown that attention-based language models excel at recall, the ability to ground generations in tokens previously seen in context. However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 5.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 100  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 2. Online Training Through Time for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Mingqing Xiao, Qingyan Meng, Zongpeng Zhang, D.K. He, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes online training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging instantaneous loss and gradients, and theoretically analyze and prove that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and recurrent conditions.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) are promising brain-inspired energy-efficient models. Recent progress in training methods has enabled successful deep SNNs on large-scale tasks with low latency. Particularly, backpropagation through time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients (SG) is popularly used to achieve high performance in a very small number of time steps. However, it is at the cost of large memory consumption for training, lack of theoretical clarity for optimization, and inconsistency with the online property of biological learning and rules on neuromorphic hardware. Other works connect spike representations of SNNs with equivalent artificial neural network formulation and train SNNs by gradients from equivalent mappings to ensure descent directions. But they fail to achieve low latency and are also not online. In this work, we propose online training through time (OTTT) for SNNs, which is derived from BPTT to enable forward-in-time learning by tracking presynaptic activities and leveraging instantaneous loss and gradients. Meanwhile, we theoretically analyze and prove that gradients of OTTT can provide a similar descent direction for optimization as gradients based on spike representations under both feedforward and recurrent conditions. OTTT only requires constant training memory costs agnostic to time steps, avoiding the significant memory costs of BPTT for GPU training. Furthermore, the update rule of OTTT is in the form of three-factor Hebbian learning, which could pave a path for online on-chip learning. With OTTT, it is the first time that two mainstream supervised SNN training methods, BPTT with SG and spike representation-based training, are connected, and meanwhile in a biologically plausible form. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet, and CIFAR10-DVS demonstrate the superior performance of our method on large-scale static and neuromorphic datasets in small time steps.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 39  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3.

Training of DWNs is enabled by a novel Extended Finite Difference technique for approximate differentiation of binary values. We propose Learnable Mapping, Learnable Reduction, and Spectral Regularization to further improve the accuracy and efficiency of these models. We evaluate DWNs in three edge computing contexts: (1) an FPGA-based hardware accelerator, where they demonstrate superior latency, throughput, energy efficiency, and model area compared to state-of-the-art solutions, (2) a low-power microcontroller, where they achieve preferable accuracy to XGBoost while subject to stringent memory constraints, and (3) ultra-low-cost chips, where they consistently outperform small models in both accuracy and projected hardware area. DWNs also compare favorably against leading approaches for tabular datasets, with higher average rank. Overall, our work positions DWNs as a pioneering solution for edge-compatible high-throughput neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Low-rank lottery tickets: finding efficient low-rank neural networks via matrix differential equations\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Steffen Schotth\u00f6fer, Emanuele Zangrando, J. Kusch, Gianluca Ceruti, Francesco Tudisco*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks that are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks have achieved tremendous success in a large variety of applications. However, their memory footprint and computational demand can render them impractical in application settings with limited hardware or energy resources. In this work, we propose a novel algorithm to find efficient low-rank subnetworks. Remarkably, these subnetworks are determined and adapted already during the training phase and the overall time and memory resources required by both training and evaluating them are significantly reduced. The main idea is to restrict the weight matrices to a low-rank manifold and to update the low-rank factors rather than the full matrix during training. To derive training updates that are restricted to the prescribed manifold, we employ techniques from dynamic model order reduction for matrix differential equations. This allows us to provide approximation, stability, and descent guarantees. Moreover, our method automatically and dynamically adapts the ranks during training to achieve the desired approximation accuracy. The efficiency of the proposed method is demonstrated through a variety of numerical experiments on fully-connected and convolutional networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 32  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Linear Symmetric Quantization of Neural Networks for Low-precision Integer Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Xiandong Zhao, Ying Wang, Xuyi Cai, Cheng Liu, Lei Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors is proposed, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators and multipliers.\n\n**Abstract:** With the proliferation of specialized neural network processors that operate on low-precision integers, the performance of Deep Neural Network inference becomes increasingly dependent on the result of quantization. Despite plenty of prior work on the quantization of weights or activations for neural networks, there is still a wide gap between the software quantizers and the low-precision accelerator implementation, which degrades either the efficiency of networks or that of the hardware for the lack of software and hardware coordination at design-phase. In this paper, we propose a learned linear symmetric quantizer for integer neural network processors, which not only quantizes neural parameters and activations to low-bit integer but also accelerates hardware inference by using batch normalization fusion and low-precision accumulators (e.g., 16-bit) and multipliers (e.g., 4-bit). We use a unified way to quantize weights and activations, and the results outperform many previous approaches for various networks such as AlexNet, ResNet, and lightweight models like MobileNet while keeping friendly to the accelerator architecture. Additional, we also apply the method to object detection models and witness high performance and accuracy in YOLO-v2. Finally, we deploy the quantized models on our specialized integer-arithmetic-only DNN accelerator to show the effectiveness of the proposed quantizer. We show that even with linear symmetric quantization, the results can be better than asymmetric or non-linear methods in 4-bit networks. In evaluation, the proposed quantizer induces less than 0.4\\% accuracy drop in ResNet18, ResNet34, and AlexNet when quantizing the whole network as required by the integer processors.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. DeFiNES: Enabling Fast Exploration of the Depth-first Scheduling Space for DNN Accelerators through Analytical Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** DNN workloads can be scheduled onto DNN accelerators in many different ways: from layer-by-layer scheduling to cross-layer depth-first scheduling (a.k.a. layer fusion, or cascaded execution). This results in a very broad scheduling space, with each schedule leading to varying hardware (HW) costs in terms of energy and latency. To rapidly explore this vast space for a wide variety of hardware architectures, analytical cost models are crucial to estimate scheduling effects on the HW level. However, state-of-the-art cost models are lacking support for exploring the complete depth-first scheduling space, for instance focusing only on activations while ignoring weights, or modeling only DRAM accesses while overlooking on-chip data movements. These limitations prevent researchers from systematically and accurately understanding the depth-first scheduling space. After formalizing this design space, this work proposes a unified modeling framework, DeFiNES, for layer-by-layer and depth-first scheduling to fill in the gaps. DeFiNES enables analytically estimating the hardware cost for possible schedules in terms of both energy and latency, while considering data access at every memory level. This is done for each schedule and HW architecture under study by optimally choosing the active part of the memory hierarchy per unique combination of operand, layer, and feature map tile. The hardware costs are estimated, taking into account both data computation and data copy phases. The analytical cost model is validated against measured data from a taped-out depth-first DNN accelerator, DepFiN, showing good modeling accuracy at the end-to-end neural network level. A comparison with generalized state-of-the-art demonstrates up to 10X better solutions found with DeFiNES.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. AutoDNNchip: An Automated DNN Chip Predictor and Builder for Both FPGAs and ASICs\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Yue Wang, Zetong Guan, Yongan Zhang, Yingyan Lin, Deming Chen, Cong Hao, Xiaofan Zhang, Pengfei Xu, Chaojian Li, Yang Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent breakthroughs in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have fueled a growing demand for DNN chips. However, designing DNN chips is non-trivial because: (1) mainstream DNNs have millions of parameters and operations; (2) the large design space due to the numerous design choices of dataflows, processing elements, memory hierarchy, etc.; and (3) an algorithm/hardware co-design is needed to allow the same DNN functionality to have a different decomposition, which would require different hardware IPs to meet the application specifications. Therefore, DNN chips take a long time to design and require cross-disciplinary experts. To enable fast and effective DNN chip design, we propose AutoDNNchip - a DNN chip generator that can automatically generate both FPGA- and ASIC-based DNN chip implementation given DNNs from machine learning frameworks (e.g., PyTorch) for a designated application and dataset. Specifically, AutoDNNchip consists of two integrated enablers: (1) a Chip Predictor, built on top of a graph-based accelerator representation, which can accurately and efficiently predict a DNN accelerator's energy, throughput, and area based on the DNN model parameters, hardware configuration, technology-based IPs, and platform constraints; and (2) a Chip Builder, which can automatically explore the design space of DNN chips (including IP selection, block configuration, resource balancing, etc.), optimize chip design via the Chip Predictor, and then generate optimized synthesizable RTL to achieve the target design metrics. Experimental results show that our Chip Predictor's predicted performance differs from real-measured ones by < 10% when validated using 15 DNN models and 4 platforms (edge-FPGA/TPU/GPU and ASIC). Furthermore, accelerators generated by our AutoDNNchip can achieve better (up to 3.86X improvement) performance than that of expert-crafted state-of-the-art accelerators.\n\n**Published:** 2020-01-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. HIDA: A Hierarchical Dataflow Compiler for High-Level Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator memory hierarchy neural networks*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Dataflow architectures are growing in popularity due to their potential to mitigate the challenges posed by the memory wall inherent to the Von Neumann architecture. At the same time, high-level synthesis (HLS) has demonstrated its efficacy as a design methodology for generating efficient dataflow architectures within a short development cycle. However, existing HLS tools rely on developers to explore the vast dataflow design space, ultimately leading to suboptimal designs. This phenomenon is especially concerning as the size of the HLS design grows. To tackle these challenges, we introduce HIDA, a new scalable and hierarchical HLS framework that can systematically convert an algorithmic description into a dataflow implementation on hardware. We first propose a collection of efficient and versatile dataflow representations for modeling the hierarchical dataflow structure. Capitalizing on these representations, we develop an automated optimizer that decomposes the dataflow optimization problem into multiple levels based on the inherent dataflow hierarchy. Using FPGAs as an evaluation platform, working with a set of neural networks modeled in PyTorch, HIDA achieves up to 8.54$\\times$ higher throughput compared to the state-of-the-art (SOTA) HLS optimization tool. Furthermore, despite being fully automated and able to handle various applications, HIDA achieves 1.29$\\times$ higher throughput over the SOTA RTL-based neural network accelerators on an FPGA.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on hardware accelerator architectures, memory hierarchy optimizations, and data movement patterns, here are some key insights and references from the provided sources:\n\n## Modern ML Accelerator Designs\n\n### AI Accelerators\nModern ML accelerator designs often involve specialized hardware such as GPUs, TPUs, and NPUs.

These methods are particularly effective when implemented on FPGAs.\n\n## Data Movement Patterns and Optimizations\n\n### Hardware-Software Co-optimization\nCo-optimizing hardware and software can significantly improve the efficiency of neural network inference.\n\n- **Event-Driven Computation**: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) implement event-driven computations, avoiding expensive multiplication operations and reducing data movement. A hardware-software co-optimization strategy can port software-trained DNNs to reduced-precision SNN models, achieving fast and accurate inference on resource-efficient hardware accelerators.\n- **Parallel Acceleration**: FPGA-based parallel acceleration algorithms can optimize data supply strategies and mapping mechanisms to address throughput limitations. This approach can enhance the efficiency of neural network inference, especially in edge computing applications.\n\n### Cache-Friendly Computation Patterns\nEnsuring that computation patterns are cache-friendly is essential for optimizing data movement and reducing latency.\n\n- **Systolic Array Compatibility**: Designs that are compatible with systolic arrays can optimize data movement by minimizing the need for external memory accesses.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

In this work, we introduce SPARSEK Attention, a novel sparse attention mechanism designed to overcome these computational and memory obstacles while maintaining performance. Our approach integrates a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, SPARSEK, to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query, thereby enabling gradient-based optimization. As a result, SPARSEK Attention offers linear time complexity and constant memory footprint during generation. Experimental results reveal that SPARSEK Attention outperforms previous sparse attention methods and provides significant speed improvements during both training and inference, particularly in language modeling and downstream tasks. Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 33/41 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2009.06097, 2020.

Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.95)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

PINNsFormer: A Transformer-Based Framework For Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Leo Zhao, Xueying Ding, B. Prakash*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address the limitation of conventional PINNs in approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs), which achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising deep learning framework for approximating numerical solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). However, conventional PINNs, relying on multilayer perceptrons (MLP), neglect the crucial temporal dependencies inherent in practical physics systems and thus fail to propagate the initial condition constraints globally and accurately capture the true solutions under various scenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel Transformer-based framework, termed PINNsFormer, designed to address this limitation. PINNsFormer can accurately approximate PDE solutions by utilizing multi-head attention mechanisms to capture temporal dependencies. PINNsFormer transforms point-wise inputs into pseudo sequences and replaces point-wise PINNs loss with a sequential loss. Additionally, it incorporates a novel activation function, Wavelet, which anticipates Fourier decomposition through deep neural networks. Empirical results demonstrate that PINNsFormer achieves superior generalization ability and accuracy across various scenarios, including PINNs failure modes and high-dimensional PDEs. Moreover, PINNsFormer offers flexibility in integrating existing learning schemes for PINNs, further enhancing its performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Unraveling Feature Extraction Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xiaobing Sun, Jiaxi Li, Wei Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Considering the infinite network width, it is hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening insights into their internal mechanisms and aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying mechanism of neural networks in capturing precise knowledge has been the subject of consistent research efforts. In this work, we propose a theoretical approach based on Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) to investigate such mechanisms. Specifically, considering the infinite network width, we hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening our insights into their internal mechanisms. We apply our approach to several fundamental models and reveal how these models leverage statistical features during gradient descent and how they are integrated into final decisions. We also discovered that the choice of activation function can affect feature extraction. For instance, the use of the \\textit{ReLU} activation function could potentially introduce a bias in features, providing a plausible explanation for its replacement with alternative functions in recent pre-trained language models. Additionally, we find that while self-attention and CNN models may exhibit limitations in learning n-grams, multiplication-based models seem to excel in this area. We verify these theoretical findings through experiments and find that they can be applied to analyze language modeling tasks, which can be regarded as a special variant of classification. Our contributions offer insights into the roles and capacities of fundamental components within large language models, thereby aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. How to Find Your Friendly Neighborhood: Graph Attention Design with Self-Supervision\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Dongkwan Kim, Alice H. Oh*\n\n**TL;DR:** A self-supervised graph attention network (SuperGAT) is proposed, an improved graph attention model for noisy graphs that exploits two attention forms compatible with a self- supervised task to predict edges, whose presence and absence contain the inherent information about the importance of the relationships between nodes.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism in graph neural networks is designed to assign larger weights to important neighbor nodes for better representation. However, what graph attention learns is not understood well, particularly when graphs are noisy. In this paper, we propose a self-supervised graph attention network (SuperGAT), an improved graph attention model for noisy graphs. Specifically, we exploit two attention forms compatible with a self-supervised task to predict edges, whose presence and absence contain the inherent information about the importance of the relationships between nodes. By encoding edges, SuperGAT learns more expressive attention in distinguishing mislinked neighbors. We find two graph characteristics influence the effectiveness of attention forms and self-supervision: homophily and average degree. Thus, our recipe provides guidance on which attention design to use when those two graph characteristics are known. Our experiment on 17 real-world datasets demonstrates that our recipe generalizes across 15 datasets of them, and our models designed by recipe show improved performance over baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 223  (*Influential: 31*)\n\n#### 5. Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xinyi Wu, A. Ajorlou, Zihui Wu, A. Jadbabaie*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is established that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially.\n\n**Abstract:** Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. GhostNetV2: Enhance Cheap Operation with Long-Range Attention\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chao Xu, Chang Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Kai Han, Yehui Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Light-weight convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specially designed for applications on mobile devices with faster inference speed. The convolutional operation can only capture local information in a window region, which prevents performance from being further improved. Introducing self-attention into convolution can capture global information well, but it will largely encumber the actual speed. In this paper, we propose a hardware-friendly attention mechanism (dubbed DFC attention) and then present a new GhostNetV2 architecture for mobile applications. The proposed DFC attention is constructed based on fully-connected layers, which can not only execute fast on common hardware but also capture the dependence between long-range pixels. We further revisit the expressiveness bottleneck in previous GhostNet and propose to enhance expanded features produced by cheap operations with DFC attention, so that a GhostNetV2 block can aggregate local and long-range information simultaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of GhostNetV2 over existing architectures. For example, it achieves 75.3% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet with 167M FLOPs, significantly suppressing GhostNetV1 (74.5%) with a similar computational cost.

Real Spike: Learning Real-valued Spikes for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Zhe Ma, Xuhui Huang, YingLei Wang, Xiaode Liu, Xinyi Tong, Yuanpei Chen, Liwen Zhang, Yufei Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** Brain-inspired spiking neural networks (SNNs) have recently drawn more and more attention due to their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics. The integration of storage and computation paradigm on neuromorphic hardwares makes SNNs much different from Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). In this paper, we argue that SNNs may not benefit from the weight-sharing mechanism, which can effectively reduce parameters and improve inference efficiency in DNNs, in some hardwares, and assume that an SNN with unshared convolution kernels could perform better. Motivated by this assumption, a training-inference decoupling method for SNNs named as Real Spike is proposed, which not only enjoys both unshared convolution kernels and binary spikes in inference-time but also maintains both shared convolution kernels and Real-valued Spikes during training. This decoupling mechanism of SNN is realized by a re-parameterization technique. Furthermore, based on the training-inference-decoupled idea, a series of different forms for implementing Real Spike on different levels are presented, which also enjoy shared convolutions in the inference and are friendly to both neuromorphic and non-neuromorphic hardware platforms. A theoretical proof is given to clarify that the Real Spike-based SNN network is superior to its vanilla counterpart. Experimental results show that all different Real Spike versions can consistently improve the SNN performance. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on both non-spiking static and neuromorphic datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-13\n\n\n\n#### 3. DASS: Differentiable Architecture Search for Sparse neural networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware friendly attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Masoud Daneshtalab, Mina Alibeigi, Mohammad Loni, Hamid Mousavi*\n\n**Abstract:** The deployment of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on edge devices is hindered by the substantial gap between performance requirements and available processing power. While recent research has made significant strides in developing pruning methods to build a sparse network for reducing the computing overhead of DNNs, there remains considerable accuracy loss, especially at high pruning ratios. We find that the architectures designed for dense networks by differentiable architecture search methods are ineffective when pruning mechanisms are applied to them. The main reason is that the current method does not support sparse architectures in their search space and uses a search objective that is made for dense networks and does not pay any attention to sparsity. In this paper, we propose a new method to search for sparsity-friendly neural architectures. We do this by adding two new sparse operations to the search space and modifying the search objective. We propose two novel parametric SparseConv and SparseLinear operations in order to expand the search space to include sparse operations. In particular, these operations make a flexible search space due to using sparse parametric versions of linear and convolution operations. The proposed search objective lets us train the architecture based on the sparsity of the search space operations. Quantitative analyses demonstrate that our search architectures outperform those used in the stateof-the-art sparse networks on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. In terms of performance and hardware effectiveness, DASS increases the accuracy of the sparse version of MobileNet-v2 from 73.44% to 81.35% (+7.91% improvement) with 3.87x faster inference time.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on hardware-friendly attention mechanisms and neural architectures, here are some key findings and references that align with your requirements:\n\n## Novel Attention Variants Optimized for Hardware\n\n### Memristor-Based Attention Mechanisms\nPapers and discuss the use of memristor-based in-memory computing to optimize the self-attention mechanism in transformer networks.

While not explicitly detailed in the provided sources, systolic arrays are known for their ability to perform regular computation patterns efficiently, which is beneficial for hardware-friendly neural architectures.\n\nIn summary, the use of memristor-based in-memory computing, IO-aware attention mechanisms like FlashAttention, and the optimization of linear attention mechanisms are key directions for designing hardware-friendly attention variants and neural architectures. These approaches can significantly improve the efficiency and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

Conclusion\n\nWe introduced Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that unleashed the full power of linear attention. As a result, our Lightning Attention can handle various sequence lengths with a constant speed under a constant memory footprint. The main concept is to divide the calculation of attention into intro-blocks and inter-blocks, while applying distinct computation techniques to perform the calculation. A new architecture, TNL, that is tailored for Lightning Attention is presented. TNL outperforms existing efficient language models in terms of both efficiency and accuracy and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art large language models using conventional transformer architectures. ## Acknowledgement\n\nThis work is partially supported by the National Key R\\&D Program of China (NO.2022ZD0160100).

By addressing the limitations of linear attention in varying sequence lengths without increasing memory consumption, this advancement democratizes access to state-of-the-art language models, potentially reducing the computational and environmental footprint of large-scale AI systems. Ethically, it underscores a move towards more sustainable AI practices, yet raises questions about the proliferation of powerful language models and their societal impacts, including concerns over privacy, misinformation, and the digital divide. ## References\n\nAlmazrouei, E., Alobeidli, H., Alshamsi, A., Cappelli, A., Cojocaru, R., Debbah, M., Goffinet, E., Heslow, D., Launay, J., Malartic, Q., et al.

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

We implement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that it is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/8 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\n(2021), and Poli et al. (2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, we need to focus on several key aspects:\n\n### Novelty and Unique Contributions\nThe researcher needs to identify how the **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** model can offer unique contributions beyond what is already present in the literature.

Several recent works have explored:\n\n   - **Dual-Stream Architectures:** Implementing fast and slow processing streams to capture both local and global dependencies.\n   - **Hierarchical Linear Attention Architectures:** Employing hierarchical processing in linear attention models to efficiently handle long sequences while maintaining computational efficiency.\n   - **Adaptive Compression in State-Space Models:** Utilizing adaptive state compression techniques to optimize memory usage without sacrificing performance.\n\n   The integration of these components into linear attention models like **FastTTTLinear** is not entirely novel.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. VIBE: Topic-Driven Temporal Adaptation for Twitter Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Yuji Zhang, Jing Li, Wenjie Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reflects feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and proposes a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions, which utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time.\n\n**Abstract:** Language features are evolving in real-world social media, resulting in the deteriorating performance of text classification in dynamics. To address this challenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are tested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or knowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social media data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information Bottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the distinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with timestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time. Substantial Twitter experiments on three classification tasks show that our model, with only 3% of data, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art continued-pretraining methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary.

Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Chaitanya K. Ryali, Yuan-Ting Hu, Daniel Bolya, Chen Wei, Haoqi Fan, Po-Yao (Bernie) Huang, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Arkabandhu Chowdhury, Omid Poursaeed, Judy Hoffman, J. Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M. Larson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression, and reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of P AP perturbation.\n\n**Abstract:** Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 8. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Nitesh B. Gundavarapu, Yoshua Bengio, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Kshitij Gupta, Aniket Didolkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Adelle Coster, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Lincan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Henryk Michalewski, Christian Szegedy, Yuhuai Wu, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Szymon Tworkowski, Piotr Nawrot*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-transformers-are-more-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n#### 5. Maximizing Communication Efficiency for Large-scale Training via 0/1 Adam\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Christopher De Sa, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yucheng Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** 1-bit gradient compression and local steps are two representative techniques that enable drastic communication reduction in distributed SGD. Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT). In this paper, we demonstrate the non-linearity in Adam causes slow convergence even when 1-bit compression or local steps are individually applied. To alleviate this limitation, we propose 0/1 Adam that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. 0/1 Adam performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for 0/1 Adam on smooth non-convex objectives. On various large-scale benchmarks such as BERT-Base, BERT-Large, GPT-2 pre-training and ImageNet, we demonstrate on up to 128 GPUs that 0/1 Adam is able to reduce up to 87% of data volume, 54% of communication rounds, and achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher training throughput and end-to-end training time reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline 1-bit Adam; while enjoying the same statistical convergence speed and end task model accuracy on GLUE dataset and ImageNet validation set.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 12/71 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nThe U.S. Government is authorized to reproduce and distribute reprints for Governmental purposes notwithstanding any copyright notation thereon.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Kobyzev*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks and introduces the SSM-pooler model, which achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient than self-attention-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on numerous NLP applications. However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. When Do Transformers Shine in RL? Decoupling Memory from Credit Assignment\n\n*From Search Query: Compressive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Tianwei Ni, Michel Ma, Benjamin Eysenbach, Pierre-Luc Bacon*\n\n**TL;DR:** The empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago, however, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms face two distinct challenges: learning effective representations of past and present observations, and determining how actions influence future returns. Both challenges involve modeling long-term dependencies. The Transformer architecture has been very successful to solve problems that involve long-term dependencies, including in the RL domain. However, the underlying reason for the strong performance of Transformer-based RL methods remains unclear: is it because they learn effective memory, or because they perform effective credit assignment? After introducing formal definitions of memory length and credit assignment length, we design simple configurable tasks to measure these distinct quantities. Our empirical results reveal that Transformers can enhance the memory capability of RL algorithms, scaling up to tasks that require memorizing observations $1500$ steps ago. However, Transformers do not improve long-term credit assignment. In summary, our results provide an explanation for the success of Transformers in RL, while also highlighting an important area for future research and benchmark design.

Archambeau*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters that is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, data to train machine learning models becomes available over time. Unfortunately, these models struggle to continually learn new concepts without forgetting what has been learnt in the past. This phenomenon is known as catastrophic forgetting and it is difficult to prevent due to practical constraints. For instance, the amount of data that can be stored or the computational resources that can be used might be limited. Moreover, applications increasingly rely on large pre-trained neural networks, such as pre-trained Transformers, since the resources or data might not be available in sufficiently large quantities to practitioners to train the model from scratch. In this paper, we devise a method to incrementally train a model on a sequence of tasks using pre-trained Transformers and extending them with Adapters. Different than the existing approaches, our method is able to scale to a large number of tasks without significant overhead and allows sharing information across tasks. On both image and text classification tasks, we empirically demonstrate that our method maintains a good predictive performance without retraining the model or increasing the number of model parameters over time. The resulting model is also significantly faster at inference time compared to Adapter-based state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 36  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Large Language Models are Built-in Autoregressive Search Engines\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream Architecture Language Models*\n\n*Noah Ziems, W. Yu, Zhihan Zhang, Meng Jiang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper finds that large language models (LLMs) can follow human instructions to directly generate URLs for document retrieval, and can be thought of as built-in search engines, since they have not been explicitly trained to map questions to document identifiers.\n\n**Abstract:** Document retrieval is a key stage of standard Web search engines. Existing dual-encoder dense retrievers obtain representations for questions and documents independently, allowing for only shallow interactions between them. To overcome this limitation, recent autoregressive search engines replace the dual-encoder architecture by directly generating identifiers for relevant documents in the candidate pool. However, the training cost of such autoregressive search engines rises sharply as the number of candidate documents increases. In this paper, we find that large language models (LLMs) can follow human instructions to directly generate URLs for document retrieval. Surprisingly, when providing a few {Query-URL} pairs as in-context demonstrations, LLMs can generate Web URLs where nearly 90\\% of the corresponding documents contain correct answers to open-domain questions. In this way, LLMs can be thought of as built-in search engines, since they have not been explicitly trained to map questions to document identifiers. Experiments demonstrate that our method can consistently achieve better retrieval performance than existing retrieval approaches by a significant margin on three open-domain question answering benchmarks, under both zero and few-shot settings.

Solving Math Word Problems via Cooperative Reasoning induced Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream Architecture Language Models*\n\n*Xinyu Zhu, Junjie Wang, Lin Zhang, Yuxiang Zhang, Ruyi Gan, Jiaxing Zhang, Yujiu Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work develops a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the verifier, which achieves decent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale pre-trained language models (PLMs) bring new opportunities to challenging problems, especially those that need high-level intelligence, such as the math word problem (MWPs). However, directly applying existing PLMs to MWPs can fail as the generation process lacks sufficient supervision and thus lacks fast adaptivity as humans. We notice that human reasoning has a dual reasoning framework that consists of an immediate reaction system (system 1) and a delicate reasoning system (system 2), where the entire reasoning is determined by their interaction. This inspires us to develop a cooperative reasoning-induced PLM for solving MWPs, called Cooperative Reasoning (CoRe), resulting in a human-like reasoning architecture with system 1 as the generator and system 2 as the verifier. In our approach, the generator is responsible for generating reasoning paths, and the verifiers are used to supervise the evaluation in order to obtain reliable feedback for the generator. We evaluate our CoRe framework on several mathematical reasoning datasets and achieve decent improvement over state-of-the-art methods, up to 9.6% increase over best baselines.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 51  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 6. A Mechanistic Interpretation of Arithmetic Reasoning in Language Models using Causal Mediation Analysis\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream Architecture Language Models*\n\n*Alessandro Stolfo, Yonatan Belinkov, Mrinmaya Sachan*\n\n**TL;DR:** A mechanistic interpretation of Transformer-based LMs on arithmetic questions using a causal mediation analysis framework is presented and results indicate that LMs process the input by transmitting the information relevant to the query from mid-sequence early layers to the final token using the attention mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Mathematical reasoning in large language models (LMs) has garnered significant attention in recent work, but there is a limited understanding of how these models process and store information related to arithmetic tasks within their architecture. In order to improve our understanding of this aspect of language models, we present a mechanistic interpretation of Transformer-based LMs on arithmetic questions using a causal mediation analysis framework. By intervening on the activations of specific model components and measuring the resulting changes in predicted probabilities, we identify the subset of parameters responsible for specific predictions. This provides insights into how information related to arithmetic is processed by LMs. Our experimental results indicate that LMs process the input by transmitting the information relevant to the query from mid-sequence early layers to the final token using the attention mechanism. Then, this information is processed by a set of MLP modules, which generate result-related information that is incorporated into the residual stream. To assess the specificity of the observed activation dynamics, we compare the effects of different model components on arithmetic queries with other tasks, including number retrieval from prompts and factual knowledge questions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Compressive Transformers for Long-Range Sequence Modelling\n\n*From Search Query: Compressive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Siddhant M. Jayakumar, Anna Potapenko, Jack W. Rae, Timothy P. Lillicrap*\n\n**Abstract:** We present the Compressive Transformer, an attentive sequence model which compresses past memories for long-range sequence learning. We find the Compressive Transformer obtains state-of-the-art language modelling results in the WikiText-103 and Enwik8 benchmarks, achieving 17.1 ppl and 0.97 bpc respectively. We also find it can model high-frequency speech effectively and can be used as a memory mechanism for RL, demonstrated on an object matching task. To promote the domain of long-range sequence learning, we propose a new open-vocabulary language modelling benchmark derived from books, PG-19.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2020-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-13\n\n\n\n#### 4. Memory AMP\n\n*From Search Query: Compressive Memory Transformers*\n\n*Brian M. Kurkoski, Shunqi Huang, Lei Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Approximate message passing (AMP) is a low-cost iterative parameter-estimation technique for certain high-dimensional linear systems with non-Gaussian distributions. AMP only applies to independent identically distributed (IID) transform matrices, but may become unreliable (e.g., perform poorly or even diverge) for other matrix ensembles, especially for ill-conditioned ones. To solve this issue, orthogonal/vector AMP (OAMP/VAMP) was proposed for general right-unitarily-invariant matrices. However, the Bayes-optimal OAMP/VAMP (BO-OAMP/VAMP) requires a high-complexity linear minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator. This prevents OAMP/VAMP from being used in large-scale systems. To address the drawbacks of AMP and BO-OAMP/VAMP, this paper offers a memory AMP (MAMP) framework based on the orthogonality principle, which ensures that estimation errors in MAMP are asymptotically IID Gaussian. To realize the required orthogonality for MAMP, we provide an orthogonalization procedure for the local memory estimators. In addition, we propose a Bayes-optimal MAMP (BO-MAMP), in which a long-memory matched filter is used for interference suppression. The complexity of BO-MAMP is comparable to AMP. To asymptotically characterize the performance of BO-MAMP, a state evolution is derived. The relaxation parameters and damping vector in BO-MAMP are optimized based on state evolution. Most crucially, the state evolution of the optimized BO-MAMP converges to the same fixed point as that of the high-complexity BO-OAMP/VAMP for all right-unitarily-invariant matrices, and achieves the Bayes optimal MSE predicted by the replica method if its state evolution has a unique fixed point. Finally, simulations are provided to verify the theoretical results' validity and accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2020-12-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Single-Stream Multi-Level Alignment for Vision-Language Pretraining\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream Architecture Language Models*\n\n*Yun Fu, Manmohan Chandraker, Samuel Schulter, Xiang Yu, Vijay Kumar BG, Zaid Khan*\n\n**Abstract:** Self-supervised vision-language pretraining from pure images and text with a contrastive loss is effective, but ignores fine-grained alignment due to a dual-stream architecture that aligns image and text representations only on a global level. Earlier, supervised, non-contrastive methods were capable of finer-grained alignment, but required dense annotations that were not scalable. We propose a single stream architecture that aligns images and language at multiple levels: global, fine-grained patch-token, and conceptual/semantic, using two novel tasks: symmetric cross-modality reconstruction (XMM) and a pseudo-labeled key word prediction (PSL). In XMM, we mask input tokens from one modality and use cross-modal information to reconstruct the masked token, thus improving fine-grained alignment between the two modalities. In PSL, we use attention to select keywords in a caption, use a momentum encoder to recommend other important keywords that are missing from the caption but represented in the image, and then train the visual encoder to predict the presence of those keywords, helping it learn semantic concepts that are essential for grounding a textual token to an image region. We demonstrate competitive performance and improved data efficiency on image-text retrieval, grounding, visual question answering/reasoning against larger models and models trained on more data.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

However, the recurrent state size of HGRN remains relatively small, which limits its expressiveness.To address this issue, inspired by linear attention, we introduce a simple outer-product-based state expansion mechanism so that the recurrent state size can be significantly enlarged without introducing any additional parameters. The linear attention form also allows for hardware-efficient training.Our extensive experiments verify the advantage of HGRN2 over HGRN1 in language modeling, image classification, and Long Range Arena.Our largest 3B HGRN2 model slightly outperforms Mamba and LLaMa Architecture Transformer for language modeling in a controlled experiment setting; and performs competitively with many open-source 3B models in downstream evaluation while using much fewer total training tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/29 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2405.21060, 2024.

When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models (Avg.

Lin*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation. While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/24 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\n[29] Mingjie Sun, Xinlei Chen, J.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

A Dual-Stream Neural Network Explains the Functional Segregation of Dorsal and Ventral Visual Pathways in Human Brains\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream FastTTTLinear Models*\n\n*Minkyu Choi, Kuan Han, Xiaokai Wang, Yizhen Zhang, Zhongming Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is speculated that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs.\n\n**Abstract:** The human visual system uses two parallel pathways for spatial processing and object recognition. In contrast, computer vision systems tend to use a single feedforward pathway, rendering them less robust, adaptive, or efficient than human vision. To bridge this gap, we developed a dual-stream vision model inspired by the human eyes and brain. At the input level, the model samples two complementary visual patterns to mimic how the human eyes use magnocellular and parvocellular retinal ganglion cells to separate retinal inputs to the brain. At the backend, the model processes the separate input patterns through two branches of convolutional neural networks (CNN) to mimic how the human brain uses the dorsal and ventral cortical pathways for parallel visual processing. The first branch (WhereCNN) samples a global view to learn spatial attention and control eye movements. The second branch (WhatCNN) samples a local view to represent the object around the fixation. Over time, the two branches interact recurrently to build a scene representation from moving fixations. We compared this model with the human brains processing the same movie and evaluated their functional alignment by linear transformation. The WhereCNN and WhatCNN branches were found to differentially match the dorsal and ventral pathways of the visual cortex, respectively, primarily due to their different learning objectives. These model-based results lead us to speculate that the distinct responses and representations of the ventral and dorsal streams are more influenced by their distinct goals in visual attention and object recognition than by their specific bias or selectivity in retinal inputs. This dual-stream model takes a further step in brain-inspired computer vision, enabling parallel neural networks to actively explore and understand the visual surroundings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Two-Stream Network for Sign Language Recognition and Translation\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream FastTTTLinear Models*\n\n*Yutong Chen, Ronglai Zuo, Fangyun Wei, Yu Wu, Shujie Liu, B. Mak*\n\n**TL;DR:** A dual visual encoder containing two separate streams to model both the raw videos and the keypoint sequences generated by an off-the-shelf keypoint estimator for sign language recognition (SLR) and sign language translation (SLT).\n\n**Abstract:** Sign languages are visual languages using manual articulations and non-manual elements to convey information. For sign language recognition and translation, the majority of existing approaches directly encode RGB videos into hidden representations. RGB videos, however, are raw signals with substantial visual redundancy, leading the encoder to overlook the key information for sign language understanding. To mitigate this problem and better incorporate domain knowledge, such as handshape and body movement, we introduce a dual visual encoder containing two separate streams to model both the raw videos and the keypoint sequences generated by an off-the-shelf keypoint estimator. To make the two streams interact with each other, we explore a variety of techniques, including bidirectional lateral connection, sign pyramid network with auxiliary supervision, and frame-level self-distillation. The resulting model is called TwoStream-SLR, which is competent for sign language recognition (SLR). TwoStream-SLR is extended to a sign language translation (SLT) model, TwoStream-SLT, by simply attaching an extra translation network. Experimentally, our TwoStream-SLR and TwoStream-SLT achieve state-of-the-art performance on SLR and SLT tasks across a series of datasets including Phoenix-2014, Phoenix-2014T, and CSL-Daily.

Sentiment Analysis on Streaming User Reviews via Dual-Channel Dynamic Graph Neural Network\n\n*From Search Query: Dual-Stream FastTTTLinear Models*\n\n*Xin Zhang, Linhai Zhang, Deyu Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** DC-DGNN is presented, a dual-channel framework based on a dynamic graph neural network that models temporal user and product dynamics for sentiment analysis and demonstrates the superiority of the proposed method on real-world datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Sentiment analysis on user reviews has achieved great success thanks to the rapid growth of deep learning techniques. The large number of online streaming reviews also provides the opportunity to model temporal dynamics for users and products on the timeline. However, existing methods model users and products in the real world based on a static assumption and neglect their time-varying characteristics. In this paper, we present DC-DGNN, a dual-channel framework based on a dynamic graph neural network that models temporal user and product dynamics for sentiment analysis. Specifically, a dual-channel text encoder is employed to extract current local and global contexts from review documents for users and products. Moreover, user review streams are integrated into the dynamic graph neural network by treating users and products as nodes and reviews as new edges. Node representations are dynamically updated along with the evolution of the dynamic graph and used for the final prediction. Experimental results on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Du*\n\n**TL;DR:** JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse, then dense, then dense in the presence of nonlinear activations in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose Joint MLP/Attention (JoMA) dynamics, a novel mathematical framework to understand the training procedure of multilayer Transformer architectures. This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Architectures*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work views attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and uses decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic.\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale quadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Solving High-Dimensional PDEs with Latent Spectral Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Architectures*\n\n*Haixu Wu, Tengge Hu, Huakun Luo, Jianmin Wang, Mingsheng Long*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, this work designs a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep models have achieved impressive progress in solving partial differential equations (PDEs). A burgeoning paradigm is learning neural operators to approximate the input-output mappings of PDEs. While previous deep models have explored the multiscale architectures and various operator designs, they are limited to learning the operators as a whole in the coordinate space. In real physical science problems, PDEs are complex coupled equations with numerical solvers relying on discretization into high-dimensional coordinate space, which cannot be precisely approximated by a single operator nor efficiently learned due to the curse of dimensionality. We present Latent Spectral Models (LSM) toward an efficient and precise solver for high-dimensional PDEs. Going beyond the coordinate space, LSM enables an attention-based hierarchical projection network to reduce the high-dimensional data into a compact latent space in linear time. Inspired by classical spectral methods in numerical analysis, we design a neural spectral block to solve PDEs in the latent space that approximates complex input-output mappings via learning multiple basis operators, enjoying nice theoretical guarantees for convergence and approximation. Experimentally, LSM achieves consistent state-of-the-art and yields a relative gain of 11.5% averaged on seven benchmarks covering both solid and fluid physics.

Foerster, Satinder Singh, Feryal M. P. Behbahani*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured state space sequence (S4) models have recently achieved state-of-the-art performance on long-range sequence modeling tasks. These models also have fast inference speeds and parallelisable training, making them potentially useful in many reinforcement learning settings. We propose a modification to a variant of S4 that enables us to initialise and reset the hidden state in parallel, allowing us to tackle reinforcement learning tasks. We show that our modified architecture runs asymptotically faster than Transformers in sequence length and performs better than RNN's on a simple memory-based task. We evaluate our modified architecture on a set of partially-observable environments and find that, in practice, our model outperforms RNN's while also running over five times faster. Then, by leveraging the model's ability to handle long-range sequences, we achieve strong performance on a challenging meta-learning task in which the agent is given a randomly-sampled continuous control environment, combined with a randomly-sampled linear projection of the environment's observations and actions. Furthermore, we show the resulting model can adapt to out-of-distribution held-out tasks. Overall, the results presented in this paper show that structured state space models are fast and performant for in-context reinforcement learning tasks.

In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n#### 9. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Compression in State-Space Models*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Architectures*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

MaxViT: Multi-Axis Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Attention Architectures*\n\n*Yinxiao Li, Alan Bovik, Peyman Milanfar, Feng Yang, Han Zhang, Hossein Talebi, Zhengzhong Tu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have recently gained significant attention in the computer vision community. However, the lack of scalability of self-attention mechanisms with respect to image size has limited their wide adoption in state-of-the-art vision backbones. In this paper we introduce an efficient and scalable attention model we call multi-axis attention, which consists of two aspects: blocked local and dilated global attention. These design choices allow global-local spatial interactions on arbitrary input resolutions with only linear complexity. We also present a new architectural element by effectively blending our proposed attention model with convolutions, and accordingly propose a simple hierarchical vision backbone, dubbed MaxViT, by simply repeating the basic building block over multiple stages. Notably, MaxViT is able to ''see'' globally throughout the entire network, even in earlier, high-resolution stages. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on a broad spectrum of vision tasks. On image classification, MaxViT achieves state-of-the-art performance under various settings: without extra data, MaxViT attains 86.5% ImageNet-1K top-1 accuracy; with ImageNet-21K pre-training, our model achieves 88.7% top-1 accuracy. For downstream tasks, MaxViT as a backbone delivers favorable performance on object detection as well as visual aesthetic assessment. We also show that our proposed model expresses strong generative modeling capability on ImageNet, demonstrating the superior potential of MaxViT blocks as a universal vision module.

AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Compression in State-Space Models*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy.

WavTokenizer: an Efficient Acoustic Discrete Codec Tokenizer for Audio Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Compression in State-Space Models*\n\n*Xiaoda Yang, Zehan Wang, Xize Cheng, Zhou Zhao, Wen Wang, Siqi Zheng, Qian Chen, Yidi Jiang, Rongjie Huang, Ziang Zhang, RuiQi Li, Qian Yang, Jialong Zuo, Minghui Fang, Yifu Chen, Ziyue Jiang, Shengpeng Ji*\n\n**Abstract:** Language models have been effectively applied to modeling natural signals, such as images, video, speech, and audio. A crucial component of these models is the codec tokenizer, which compresses high-dimensional natural signals into lower-dimensional discrete tokens. In this paper, we introduce WavTokenizer, which offers several advantages over previous SOTA acoustic codec models in the audio domain: 1)extreme compression. By compressing the layers of quantizers and the temporal dimension of the discrete codec, one-second audio of 24kHz sampling rate requires only a single quantizer with 40 or 75 tokens. 2)improved subjective quality. Despite the reduced number of tokens, WavTokenizer achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality with outstanding UTMOS scores and inherently contains richer semantic information. Specifically, we achieve these results by designing a broader VQ space, extended contextual windows, and improved attention networks, as well as introducing a powerful multi-scale discriminator and an inverse Fourier transform structure. We conducted extensive reconstruction experiments in the domains of speech, audio, and music. WavTokenizer exhibited strong performance across various objective and subjective metrics compared to state-of-the-art models. We also tested semantic information, VQ utilization, and adaptability to generative models. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each module in WavTokenizer. The related code, demos, and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/jishengpeng/WavTokenizer.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key areas to focus on and the most useful information to gather:\n\n### Focus Areas\n\n1. **Novelty and Unique Contributions:**\n   - The researcher needs to identify how the proposed **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** model can introduce unique methods or substantial improvements over existing models like **Temporal Latent Bottleneck**, **Hierarchical State Space Models**, and **Compressive Transformers**.\n\n2. **Integration within FastTTTLinear:**\n   - Search for recent research (2023-2024) that specifically combines hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression within the **FastTTTLinear** framework or similar linear attention models.\n\n3. **Hardware-Efficient Implementations:**\n   - Investigate studies focusing on hardware-efficient implementations of such models, which could provide a unique advantage if the proposal includes novel hardware optimizations.\n\n4. **Recent Innovations:**\n   - Focus on the latest publications to identify any new methods or architectures that might differentiate the proposal from existing work.\n\n5. **Comparative Analysis:**\n   - Prepare to compare the proposal with existing models in terms of theoretical advantages, potential performance gains, and implementation feasibility.\n\n### Useful Information to Gather\n\n#### Dual-Stream Architectures\n- Look for papers that have successfully integrated dual-stream architectures within linear attention models.

The design leverages tiling-based processing with explicit memory hierarchy management, combined with hardware-specific linear operations for improved efficiency. This approach achieves significant speedup in both training and inference while maintaining model quality through careful IO optimization and memory access pattern design.",
