FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.18)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

B'MOJO: Hybrid State Space Realizations of Foundation Models with Eidetic and Fading Memory (Avg. Score: 0.13)\n\n*L. Zancato, Arjun Seshadri, Yonatan Dukler, Aditya Golatkar, Yantao Shen, Benjamin Bowman, Matthew Trager, A. Achille, S. Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/30 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

IEEE transactions on Information Theory, 24(5):530-536, 1978. ## A Induction and Transduction\n\nExample A. 1 (Biology). We note that biological agents have no option but to operate inductively, due to (a) hard memory bounds, and (b) evolutionary pressure towards minimizing inference latency: When faced with a threat, a biological agent is better served by a quick suboptimal decision than by reasoning over all past experience. AI built on silicon has no such limitations: Memory can grow unbounded and test-time computation can be distributed and improved by hardware design. Nonetheless, any practical realization involves some kind of constraint on inference time or compute resources. Therefore, resource-constrained optimal inference hinges on how to best use the available resources against a growing memory. Example A. 2 (CNN Classifiers, VAEs and GANs). A trained representation can be co-opted to generate data. For example, a CNN can be used to classify random data until one is labeled with the desired class, and the resulting sample considered as being \"generated\" by the CNN. Similarly, one could generate random data indirectly by feeding noise to an encoder, as done in Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), again co-opting a representation for generating data. In a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), data is generated by perturbing the latent representation of a map trained to re-construct the dataset. Example A. 3 (Diffusion Models). Diffusion Models are representations, trained to re-construct the original data, but the mechanics used to reconstruct the data during training are sequential, using an artificial \"time\" variable, akin to a realization. This makes their use as \"generative representation\" natural since the reconstruction process is already a stochastic realization $8^{8}$\nExample A.\n```\n\n#### 3. HiPPO: Recurrent Memory with Optimal Polynomial Projections (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2020)\t**Cited by** 255  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale and enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients.\n\n**Abstract:** A central problem in learning from sequential data is representing cumulative history in an incremental fashion as more data is processed. We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 4. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

COLA: Orchestrating Error Coding and Learning for Robust Neural Network Inference Against Hardware Defects\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware codesign*\n\n*Anlan Yu, Ning Lyu, Jieming Yin, Zhiyuan Yan, Wujie Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely COLA, which is proposed to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by adopting a separated architecture, and orthogonalizing weights in common DNN layers so that the intermediate features are Orthogonal with each other.\n\n**Abstract:** Error correcting output codes (ECOCs) have been proposed to improve the robustness of deep neural networks (DNNs) against hardware defects of DNN hardware accelerators. Unfortunately, existing efforts suffer from drawbacks that would greatly impact their practicality: 1) robust accuracy (with defects) improvement at the cost of degraded clean accuracy (without defects); 2) no guarantee on better robust or clean accuracy using stronger ECOCs. In this paper, we first shed light on the connection between these drawbacks and error correlation, and then propose a novel comprehensive error decorrelation framework, namely COLA . Specifically, we propose to reduce inner layer feature error correlation by 1) adopting a separated architecture, where the last portions of the paths to all output nodes are separated, and 2) orthogonalizing weights in common DNN layers so that the intermediate features are orthogonal with each other. We also propose a regularization technique based on total correlation to mitigate overall error correlation at the outputs. The effectiveness of COLA is first analyzed theoretically, and then evaluated experimentally, e.g., up to 6 . 7% clean accuracy improvement compared with the original DNNs and up to 40% robust accuracy improvement compared to the state-of-the-art ECOC-enhanced DNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware codesign*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

ShiftAddNAS: Hardware-Inspired Search for More Accurate and Efficient Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware codesign*\n\n*Haoran You, Baopu Li, Huihong Shi, Y. Fu, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs and integrates the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks (NNs) with intensive multiplications (e.g., convolutions and transformers) are capable yet power hungry, impeding their more extensive deployment into resource-constrained devices. As such, multiplication-free networks, which follow a common practice in energy-efficient hardware implementation to parameterize NNs with more efficient operators (e.g., bitwise shifts and additions), have gained growing attention. However, multiplication-free networks usually under-perform their vanilla counterparts in terms of the achieved accuracy. To this end, this work advocates hybrid NNs that consist of both powerful yet costly multiplications and efficient yet less powerful operators for marrying the best of both worlds, and proposes ShiftAddNAS, which can automatically search for more accurate and more efficient NNs. Our ShiftAddNAS highlights two enablers. Specifically, it integrates (1) the first hybrid search space that incorporates both multiplication-based and multiplication-free operators for facilitating the development of both accurate and efficient hybrid NNs; and (2) a novel weight sharing strategy that enables effective weight sharing among different operators that follow heterogeneous distributions (e.g., Gaussian for convolutions vs. Laplacian for add operators) and simultaneously leads to a largely reduced supernet size and much better searched networks.

Researchers are now beginning to use recent advances in machine learning in software optimizations, augmenting or replacing traditional heuristics and data structures. However, the space of machine learning for computer hardware architecture is only lightly explored. In this paper, we demonstrate the potential of deep learning to address the von Neumann bottleneck of memory performance. We focus on the critical problem of learning memory access patterns, with the goal of constructing accurate and efficient memory prefetchers. We relate contemporary prefetching strategies to n-gram models in natural language processing, and show how recurrent neural networks can serve as a drop-in replacement. On a suite of challenging benchmark datasets, we find that neural networks consistently demonstrate superior performance in terms of precision and recall. This work represents the first step towards practical neural-network based prefetching, and opens a wide range of exciting directions for machine learning in computer architecture research.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 185  (*Influential: 23*)\n\n#### 5. Memory-Consistent Neural Networks for Imitation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Kaustubh Sridhar, Souradeep Dutta, Dinesh Jayaraman, James Weimer, Insup Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work revisits simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon, and provides a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies.\n\n**Abstract:** Imitation learning considerably simplifies policy synthesis compared to alternative approaches by exploiting access to expert demonstrations. For such imitation policies, errors away from the training samples are particularly critical. Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 10 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.

Separable Physics-Informed Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Junwoo Cho, Seungtae Nam, Hyunmo Yang, S. Yun, Youngjoon Hong, Eunbyung Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, separable PINN (SPINN), operates on a per-axis basis to significantly reduce the number of network propagations in multi-dimensional PDEs unlike point-wise processing in conventional PINNs, and can solve a chaotic (2+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation significantly faster than the best-performing prior method, maintaining accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as promising data-driven PDE solvers showing encouraging results on various PDEs. However, there is a fundamental limitation of training PINNs to solve multi-dimensional PDEs and approximate highly complex solution functions. The number of training points (collocation points) required on these challenging PDEs grows substantially, but it is severely limited due to the expensive computational costs and heavy memory overhead. To overcome this issue, we propose a network architecture and training algorithm for PINNs. The proposed method, separable PINN (SPINN), operates on a per-axis basis to significantly reduce the number of network propagations in multi-dimensional PDEs unlike point-wise processing in conventional PINNs. We also propose using forward-mode automatic differentiation to reduce the computational cost of computing PDE residuals, enabling a large number of collocation points (>10^7) on a single commodity GPU. The experimental results show drastically reduced computational costs (62x in wall-clock time, 1,394x in FLOPs given the same number of collocation points) in multi-dimensional PDEs while achieving better accuracy. Furthermore, we present that SPINN can solve a chaotic (2+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation significantly faster than the best-performing prior method (9 minutes vs 10 hours in a single GPU), maintaining accuracy. Finally, we showcase that SPINN can accurately obtain the solution of a highly nonlinear and multi-dimensional PDE, a (3+1)-d Navier-Stokes equation.

Betty: An Automatic Differentiation Library for Multilevel Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: dataflow optimization neural*\n\n*Sang Keun Choe, W. Neiswanger, P. Xie, Eric P. Xing*\n\n**TL;DR:** Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO, is introduced with a novel dataflow graph that allows to develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O( d^2), and enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based multilevel optimization (MLO) has gained attention as a framework for studying numerous problems, ranging from hyperparameter optimization and meta-learning to neural architecture search and reinforcement learning. However, gradients in MLO, which are obtained by composing best-response Jacobians via the chain rule, are notoriously difficult to implement and memory/compute intensive. We take an initial step towards closing this gap by introducing Betty, a software library for large-scale MLO. At its core, we devise a novel dataflow graph for MLO, which allows us to (1) develop efficient automatic differentiation for MLO that reduces the computational complexity from O(d^3) to O(d^2), (2) incorporate systems support such as mixed-precision and data-parallel training for scalability, and (3) facilitate implementation of MLO programs of arbitrary complexity while allowing a modular interface for diverse algorithmic and systems design choices. We empirically demonstrate that Betty can be used to implement an array of MLO programs, while also observing up to 11% increase in test accuracy, 14% decrease in GPU memory usage, and 20% decrease in training wall time over existing implementations on multiple benchmarks. We also showcase that Betty enables scaling MLO to models with hundreds of millions of parameters.

Based on these insights, we introduce a new graph-based intermediate representation (IR) which specifically aims to efficiently support fully-general AD for array programming. Unlike existing dataflow programming representations in ML frameworks, our IR naturally supports function calls, higher-order functions and recursion, making ML models easier to implement. The ability to represent closures allows us to perform AD using ST without a tape, making the resulting derivative (adjoint) program amenable to ahead-of-time optimization using tools from functional language compilers, and enabling higher-order derivatives. Lastly, we introduce a proof of concept compiler toolchain called Myia which uses a subset of Python as a front end.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 77  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 9. Neural Combinatorial Optimization with Heavy Decoder: Toward Large Scale Generalization\n\n*From Search Query: dataflow optimization neural*\n\n*Fu Luo, Xi Lin, Fei Liu, Qingfu Zhang, Zhenkun Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed LEHD model can significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance for constructive NCO and generate nearly optimal solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with up to 1000 nodes.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural combinatorial optimization (NCO) is a promising learning-based approach for solving challenging combinatorial optimization problems without specialized algorithm design by experts. However, most constructive NCO methods cannot solve problems with large-scale instance sizes, which significantly diminishes their usefulness for real-world applications. In this work, we propose a novel Light Encoder and Heavy Decoder (LEHD) model with a strong generalization ability to address this critical issue. The LEHD model can learn to dynamically capture the relationships between all available nodes of varying sizes, which is beneficial for model generalization to problems of various scales. Moreover, we develop a data-efficient training scheme and a flexible solution construction mechanism for the proposed LEHD model. By training on small-scale problem instances, the LEHD model can generate nearly optimal solutions for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP) with up to 1000 nodes, and also generalizes well to solve real-world TSPLib and CVRPLib problems. These results confirm our proposed LEHD model can significantly improve the state-of-the-art performance for constructive NCO.

LightRidge: An End-to-end Agile Design Framework for Diffractive Optical Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware codesign*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** To lower the barrier to diffractive optical neural networks (DONNs) design, exploration, and deployment, we propose LightRidge, the first end-to-end optical ML compilation framework, which consists of (1) precise and differentiable optical physics kernels that enable complete explorations of DONNs architectures, (2) optical physics computation kernel acceleration that significantly reduces the runtime cost in training, emulation, and deployment of DONNs, and (3) versatile and flexible optical system modeling and user-friendly domain-specific-language (DSL).

ESPN: Memory-Efficient Multi-Vector Information Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Zongwang Li, Narasimha Reddy, Susav Shrestha*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in information retrieval (IR) tasks. While many neural IR systems encode queries and documents into single-vector representations, multi-vector models elevate the retrieval quality by producing multi-vector representations and facilitating similarity searches at the granularity of individual tokens. However, these models significantly amplify memory and storage requirements for retrieval indices by an order of magnitude. This escalation in index size renders the scalability of multi-vector IR models progressively challenging due to their substantial memory demands. We introduce Embedding from Storage Pipelined Network (ESPN) where we offload the entire re-ranking embedding tables to SSDs and reduce the memory requirements by 5-16x. We design a software prefetcher with hit rates exceeding 90%, improving SSD based retrieval up to 6.4x, and demonstrate that we can maintain near memory levels of query latency even for large query batch sizes.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-09\n\n\n\n#### 4. DELTA: Dynamically Optimizing GPU Memory beyond Tensor Recomputation\n\n*From Search Query: memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Dongsheng Li, Zhiquan Lai, Linbo Qiao, Xingcheng Zhang, Yuliang Liu, Yufan Zhang, Chenyu Wang, Yu Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** The further development of deep neural networks is hampered by the limited GPU memory resource. Therefore, the optimization of GPU memory resources is highly demanded. Swapping and recomputation are commonly applied to make better use of GPU memory in deep learning. However, as an emerging domain, several challenges remain:1)The efficiency of recomputation is limited for both static and dynamic methods. 2)Swapping requires offloading parameters manually, which incurs a great time cost. 3) There is no such dynamic and fine-grained method that involves tensor swapping together with tensor recomputation nowadays. To remedy the above issues, we propose a novel scheduler manager named DELTA(Dynamic tEnsor offLoad and recompuTAtion). To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to make a reasonable dynamic runtime scheduler on the combination of tensor swapping and tensor recomputation without user oversight. In DELTA, we propose a filter algorithm to select the optimal tensors to be released out of GPU memory and present a director algorithm to select a proper action for each of these tensors. Furthermore, prefetching and overlapping are deliberately considered to overcome the time cost caused by swapping and recomputing tensors. Experimental results show that DELTA not only saves 40%-70% of GPU memory, surpassing the state-of-the-art method to a great extent but also gets comparable convergence results as the baseline with acceptable time delay. Also, DELTA gains 2.04$\\times$ maximum batchsize when training ResNet-50 and 2.25$\\times$ when training ResNet-101 compared with the baseline. Besides, comparisons between the swapping cost and recomputation cost in our experiments demonstrate the importance of making a reasonable dynamic scheduler on tensor swapping and tensor recomputation, which refutes the arguments in some related work that swapping should be the first and best choice.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-30\n\n\n\n#### 5. TensorFlow: A system for large-scale machine learning\n\n*From Search Query: dataflow optimization neural*\n\n*Vijay Vasudevan, Benoit Steiner, Zhifeng Chen, Mart\u00edn Abadi, Xiaoqiang Zheng, Rajat Monga, Pete Warden, Geoffrey Irving, Derek G.

Glow: Graph Lowering Compiler Techniques for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: dataflow optimization neural*\n\n*Jongsoo Park, Roman Dzhabarov, Misha Smelyanskiy, James Hegeman, Bert Maher, Satish Nadathur, Roman Levenstein, Artem Rakhov, Jakob Olesen, Summer Deng, Saleem Abdulrasool, Nadav Rotem, Jordan Fix*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents the design of Glow, a machine learning compiler for\nheterogeneous hardware. It is a pragmatic approach to compilation that enables\nthe generation of highly optimized code for multiple targets. Glow lowers the\ntraditional neural network dataflow graph into a two-phase strongly-typed\nintermediate representation. The high-level intermediate representation allows\nthe optimizer to perform domain-specific optimizations. The lower-level\ninstruction-based address-only intermediate representation allows the compiler\nto perform memory-related optimizations, such as instruction scheduling, static\nmemory allocation and copy elimination. At the lowest level, the optimizer\nperforms machine-specific code generation to take advantage of specialized\nhardware features. Glow features a lowering phase which enables the compiler to\nsupport a high number of input operators as well as a large number of hardware\ntargets by eliminating the need to implement all operators on all targets. The\nlowering phase is designed to reduce the input space and allow new hardware\nbackends to focus on a small number of linear algebra primitives.\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-02\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on novel memory prefetching patterns, hardware-specific dataflow optimizations, memory access prediction, and the integration of hardware constraints, here are some specific examples and techniques derived from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Novel Memory Prefetching Patterns in Neural Networks\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Scheduling with Predictive Prefetching**: Research by Wang et al. (2024) suggests that hierarchical memory scheduling combined with predictive prefetching can significantly reduce memory latency. This approach involves predicting which data will be needed in the near future and prefetching it to minimize the latency associated with memory accesses. This technique can reduce memory latency by up to 60% while maintaining model accuracy.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Dataflow Optimizations\n\n- **Dataflow Architectures Matching Neural Computation Patterns**: Chen et al. (2023) highlight the importance of designing dataflow architectures that align with the computation patterns of neural networks. This can lead to 3-5x efficiency gains compared to traditional approaches. For example, using spatial or temporal dataflow architectures can optimize the computation and data movement in neural networks, especially when tailored to specific hardware capabilities.\n- **OneFlow Framework**: The OneFlow framework discussed in the GitHub notes emphasizes data parallelism and model parallelism. It uses techniques like allreduce and parameter server (PS) for data parallelism and complex communication patterns for model parallelism. This framework also considers hardware-specific optimizations such as inter-chip high-speed interconnects (e.g., TPU) and vertical scaling within a single chip from general-purpose to specialized hardware.\n\n## Memory Access Prediction in Deep Learning\n\n- **KV Cache Optimization**: In the context of large language models, using KV cache techniques can predict and cache the key-value matrices for previous tokens, reducing the computational overhead for subsequent tokens. This approach, mentioned in the MLSys notes, involves caching the KV matrices for previous tokens to avoid redundant calculations, thus significantly speeding up the prediction process. However, optimizing KV cache to balance cache usage and batch size is crucial to avoid reducing the overall prediction throughput.\n\n## Integration of Hardware Constraints in Neural Architecture Design\n\n- **Hardware-Neural Co-Design**: Zhang et al. (2024) emphasize the importance of integrating neural architecture search with hardware constraints. This co-design approach ensures that the neural architectures are optimized for the specific hardware they will run on, leading to more efficient and performant models. This involves considering factors such as memory bandwidth, computation resources, and communication patterns during the neural architecture design phase.\n- **Processing Near Memory**: Research by Hyesoon Kim and colleagues on processing near memory (PNM) highlights the benefits of co-locating computation and memory to reduce memory access latency. This approach can be particularly beneficial for deep learning workloads, where minimizing memory access times is critical for performance. Techniques such as bounded staleness consistency models and instruction offloading to hybrid memory cube (HMC) can be integrated into neural architecture design to optimize memory access patterns.\n\nBy incorporating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly optimized for both performance and efficiency, leveraging novel memory prefetching patterns, hardware-specific dataflow optimizations, and integrated hardware constraints.\n",

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J.

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/43 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nKnowledge-Based Systems, 295:111780, 2024.

We introduce a general framework (HiPPO) for the online compression of continuous signals and discrete time series by projection onto polynomial bases. Given a measure that specifies the importance of each time step in the past, HiPPO produces an optimal solution to a natural online function approximation problem. As special cases, our framework yields a short derivation of the recent Legendre Memory Unit (LMU) from first principles, and generalizes the ubiquitous gating mechanism of recurrent neural networks such as GRUs. This formal framework yields a new memory update mechanism (HiPPO-LegS) that scales through time to remember all history, avoiding priors on the timescale. HiPPO-LegS enjoys the theoretical benefits of timescale robustness, fast updates, and bounded gradients. By incorporating the memory dynamics into recurrent neural networks, HiPPO RNNs can empirically capture complex temporal dependencies. On the benchmark permuted MNIST dataset, HiPPO-LegS sets a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 98.3%. Finally, on a novel trajectory classification task testing robustness to out-of-distribution timescales and missing data, HiPPO-LegS outperforms RNN and neural ODE baselines by 25-40% accuracy.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/54 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\n## A. 2 Memory in Machine Learning\n\nMemory in sequence models Sequential or temporal data in areas such as language, reinforcement learning, and continual learning can involve increasingly long dependencies. However, direct parametric modeling cannot handle inputs of unknown and potentially unbounded lengths. Many modern solutions such as attention [70] and dilated convolutions [5], are functions on finite windows, thus sidestepping the need for an explicit memory representation. While this suffices for certain tasks, these approaches can only process a finite context window instead of an entire sequence. Naively increasing the window length poses significant compute and memory challenges. This has spurred various approaches to extend this fixed context window subjected to compute and storage constraints [6, 15, 18, 42, 59, 60, 64, 74]. We instead focus on the core problem of online processing and memorization of continuous and discrete signals, and anticipate that the study of this foundational problem will be useful in improving a variety of models. Recurrent memory Recurrent neural networks are a natural tool for modeling sequential data online, with the appealing property of having unbounded context; in other words they can summarize history indefinitely. However, due to difficulties in the optimization process (vanishing/exploding gradients [56]), particular care must be paid to endow them with longer memory. The ubiquitous LSTM 34 and simplifications such as the GRU [17] control the update with gates to smooth the optimization process. With more careful parametrization, the addition of gates alone make RNNs significantly more robust and able to address long-term dependencies [31. Tallec and Ollivier [66] show that gates are in fact fundamental for recurrent dynamics by allowing time dilations. Many other approaches to endowing RNNs with better memory exist, such as noise injection [32] or non-saturating gates [9], which can suffer from instability issues.\n```\n\n#### 5. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Temperature Balancing, Layer-wise Weight Analysis, and Neural Network Training\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling strategies*\n\n*Yefan Zhou, Tianyu Pang, Keqin Liu, Charles H. Martin, Michael W. Mahoney, Yaoqing Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Regularization in modern machine learning is crucial, and it can take various forms in algorithmic design: training set, model family, error function, regularization terms, and optimizations. In particular, the learning rate, which can be interpreted as a temperature-like parameter within the statistical mechanics of learning, plays a crucial role in neural network training. Indeed, many widely adopted training strategies basically just define the decay of the learning rate over time. This process can be interpreted as decreasing a temperature, using either a global learning rate (for the entire model) or a learning rate that varies for each parameter. This paper proposes TempBalance, a straightforward yet effective layer-wise learning rate method. TempBalance is based on Heavy-Tailed Self-Regularization (HT-SR) Theory, an approach which characterizes the implicit self-regularization of different layers in trained models. We demonstrate the efficacy of using HT-SR-motivated metrics to guide the scheduling and balancing of temperature across all network layers during model training, resulting in improved performance during testing. We implement TempBalance on CIFAR10, CIFAR100, SVHN, and TinyImageNet datasets using ResNets, VGGs, and WideResNets with various depths and widths. Our results show that TempBalance significantly outperforms ordinary SGD and carefully-tuned spectral norm regularization. We also show that TempBalance outperforms a number of state-of-the-art optimizers and learning rate schedulers.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

A Scalable Neural Network for DSIC Affine Maximizer Auction Design\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling strategies*\n\n*Zhijian Duan, Haoran Sun, Yurong Chen, Xiaotie Deng*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes AMenuNet, a scalable neural network that constructs the AMA parameters (even including the allocation menu) from bidder and item representations, and enhances scalability by generating candidate allocations through a neural network.\n\n**Abstract:** Automated auction design aims to find empirically high-revenue mechanisms through machine learning. Existing works on multi item auction scenarios can be roughly divided into RegretNet-like and affine maximizer auctions (AMAs) approaches. However, the former cannot strictly ensure dominant strategy incentive compatibility (DSIC), while the latter faces scalability issue due to the large number of allocation candidates. To address these limitations, we propose AMenuNet, a scalable neural network that constructs the AMA parameters (even including the allocation menu) from bidder and item representations. AMenuNet is always DSIC and individually rational (IR) due to the properties of AMAs, and it enhances scalability by generating candidate allocations through a neural network. Additionally, AMenuNet is permutation equivariant, and its number of parameters is independent of auction scale. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that AMenuNet outperforms strong baselines in both contextual and non-contextual multi-item auctions, scales well to larger auctions, generalizes well to different settings, and identifies useful deterministic allocations. Overall, our proposed approach offers an effective solution to automated DSIC auction design, with improved scalability and strong revenue performance in various settings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Compiler directives in the form of pragmas play a crucial role in modifying the microarchitecture within the HLS framework. However, the number of possible microarchitectures grows exponentially with the number of pragmas. Moreover, the evaluation of each candidate design using the HLS tool consumes significant time, ranging from minutes to hours, leading to a slow optimization process. To accelerate this process, machine learning models have been used to predict design quality in milliseconds. However, existing open-source datasets for training such models are limited in terms of design complexity and available optimizations. In this paper, we present HLS YN , a new benchmark that addresses these limitations. It contains more complex programs with a wider range of optimization pragmas, making it a comprehensive dataset for training and evaluating design quality prediction models. The HLS YN benchmark consists of 42 unique programs/kernels, each of which has many different pragma configurations, resulting in over 42,000 labeled designs. We conduct an extensive comparison of state-of-the-art baselines to assess their effectiveness in predicting design quality. As an ongoing project, we anticipate expanding the HLS YN benchmark in terms of both quantity and variety of programs to further support the development of this field.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

The devices that execute complex models are becoming increasingly heterogeneous as we see a flourishing of domain-specific accelerators being offered as hardware accelerators in addition to CPUs. These trends necessitate distributing the workload across multiple devices. Recent work has shown that significant gains can be obtained with model parallelism, i.e, partitioning a neural network's computational graph onto multiple devices. In particular, this form of parallelism assumes a pipeline of devices, which is fed a stream of samples and yields high throughput for training and inference of DNNs. However, for such settings (large models and multiple heterogeneous devices), we require automated algorithms and toolchains that can partition the ML workload across devices. In this paper, we identify and isolate the structured optimization problem at the core of device placement of DNN operators, for both inference and training, especially in modern pipelined settings. We then provide algorithms that solve this problem to optimality. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of our approaches using several contemporary DNN computation graphs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7.

Schindler*\n\n**TL;DR:** FiLM-Ensemble is introduced, a deep, implicit ensemble method based on the concept of Feature-wise Linear Modulation, which outperforms other implicit ensemble methods, and it and comes very close to the upper bound of an explicit ensemble of networks (sometimes even beating it), at a fraction of the memory cost.\n\n**Abstract:** The ability to estimate epistemic uncertainty is often crucial when deploying machine learning in the real world, but modern methods often produce overconfident, uncalibrated uncertainty predictions. A common approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty, usable across a wide class of prediction models, is to train a model ensemble. In a naive implementation, the ensemble approach has high computational cost and high memory demand. This challenges in particular modern deep learning, where even a single deep network is already demanding in terms of compute and memory, and has given rise to a number of attempts to emulate the model ensemble without actually instantiating separate ensemble members. We introduce FiLM-Ensemble, a deep, implicit ensemble method based on the concept of Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). That technique was originally developed for multi-task learning, with the aim of decoupling different tasks. We show that the idea can be extended to uncertainty quantification: by modulating the network activations of a single deep network with FiLM, one obtains a model ensemble with high diversity, and consequently well-calibrated estimates of epistemic uncertainty, with low computational overhead in comparison. Empirically, FiLM-Ensemble outperforms other implicit ensemble methods, and it and comes very close to the upper bound of an explicit ensemble of networks (sometimes even beating it), at a fraction of the memory cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Yet these approaches struggle to scale mainly due to memory inefficiency issues, since they require parameter storage several times higher than their deterministic counterparts. To address this, we augment the weight matrix of each layer with a small number of inducing weights, thereby projecting the uncertainty quantification into such low dimensional spaces. We further extend Matheron's conditional Gaussian sampling rule to enable fast weight sampling, which enables our inference method to maintain reasonable run-time as compared with ensembles. Importantly, our approach achieves competitive performance to the state-of-the-art in prediction and uncertainty estimation tasks with fully connected neural networks and ResNets, while reducing the parameter size to $\\leq 24.3\\%$ of that of a $single$ neural network.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9.

We tile anchors on a wide\nrange of layers to ensure that all scales of faces have enough features for\ndetection. Besides, we design anchor scales based on the effective receptive\nfield and a proposed equal proportion interval principle; 2) improving the\nrecall rate of small faces by a scale compensation anchor matching strategy; 3)\nreducing the false positive rate of small faces via a max-out background label.\nAs a consequence, our method achieves state-of-the-art detection performance on\nall the common face detection benchmarks, including the AFW, PASCAL face, FDDB\nand WIDER FACE datasets, and can run at 36 FPS on a Nvidia Titan X (Pascal) for\nVGA-resolution images.\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-17\n\n\n\n#### 2. Optimizing the Memory Hierarchy by Compositing Automatic Transformations on Computations and Data\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling strategies*\n\n*Peng Di, Jie Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing compilers exploit the memory hierarchy using loop tiling and fusion, but these two transformations usually interfere with each other due to the oversight of transformations on data in memories. We present a novel composition of loop tiling and fusion in this paper. Unlike existing tiling-after-fusion algorithms that only transform computation spaces, our approach first applies rectangular/parallelogram tiling to live-out computation spaces for fitting the memory hierarchy, followed by the computation of the memory footprints required by each tile. The upwards exposed data extracted from the memory footprints are used to determine the tile shapes of intermediate computation spaces, allowing the construction of arbitrary tile shapes. Finally, our technique implements a post-tiling fusion strategy for maximizing data locality without losing tilability or parallelism of live-out computation spaces, thereby enabling storage reduction and reuse, and optimizing the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior performance on both CPU and GPU architectures over the state of the art by experimenting on 11 benchmarks extracted from numerous domains including neural networks, image processing, sparse matrix computation and linear algebra. Also, the results of the ResNet-50 model on an AI accelerator show that our approach can obtain 16% performance improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** 53rd-annual-ieee-acm-international-symposium\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-11\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems\u2014from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor\u2019s algorithm improves on Strassen\u2019s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor\u2019s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.\n\n**Proceeding:** nature-2022-10\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 5.

For example, using a square tiling configuration can reduce the number of elements read from global memory, improving performance significantly.\n- **Kronecker-Sparse Matrices**: For Kronecker-sparse matrices, a novel tiling strategy reduces memory transfers by implementing the multiplication in a single CUDA kernel. This approach minimizes the number of reads and writes between different levels of GPU memory, leading to significant speed-up and energy savings.\n\n### Cache and Register Tiling\n- **Cache Tiling**: Optimizing matrix multiplication by improving data locality through cache tiling ensures that data remains in the cache hierarchy for as long as possible. This strategy reduces memory latency and improves performance by minimizing cache misses.\n- **Register Tiling**: This involves organizing data to fit into vector registers, minimizing memory access and maximizing computational throughput. For example, adjusting the register tile size based on the phase of the LLM inference (prefill or decode phase) can significantly improve vector register utilization and overall performance.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques\n\n### GPU Optimizations\n- **CUDA Kernels**: Implementing matrix multiplication using specialized CUDA kernels can exploit the GPU's parallel processing capabilities. For instance, the new tiling strategy for Kronecker-sparse matrices implements the multiplication in a single CUDA kernel, reducing memory transfers and improving performance.\n- **Memory Hierarchy**: Optimizing the use of the GPU's memory hierarchy, including global memory, shared memory, and registers, is crucial. Techniques like using 128-bit reads and transposing tiles during memory transfers can enhance performance.\n\n### RISC-V Vector (RVV) Optimizations\n- **Vector Register Utilization**: Optimizing matrix multiplication on RISC-V architectures involves careful use of vector registers. Adjusting the register tile size based on the specific requirements of the model (e.g., prefill vs. decode phase) can improve performance significantly.\n\n### Distributed Training Optimizations\n- **Multi-Level Tiling**: For distributed training systems, a multi-level tiling strategy can leverage parallelism across multiple GPUs or nodes, balancing memory and computational efficiency. This approach allows for scaling batch sizes to unprecedented levels without compromising accuracy or training speed.\n\n## Memory Prediction and Prefetching Techniques\n\n### Learning Memory Access Patterns\n- **Predictive Prefetching**: Deep learning can be used to learn memory access patterns and construct accurate and efficient memory prefetchers. This approach addresses the von Neumann bottleneck by predicting memory accesses and reducing latency.\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Scheduling\n- **Predictive Prefetching in Neural Networks**: Hierarchical memory scheduling with predictive prefetching can reduce memory latency by up to 60% while maintaining model accuracy. This involves balancing between different memory levels (HBM, SRAM, cache) and using predictive models to prefetch data.\n\n### IO-Aware Algorithms\n- **FlashAttention**: This algorithm uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. It requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention algorithms, making it optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can significantly improve the performance, efficiency, and scalability of autoregressive language models:\n\n- **Tiling Strategies**: Implement tiling schemes that optimize matrix multiplication and other key operations, reducing memory transfers and improving data locality.\n- **Hardware-Specific Optimizations**: Tailor optimizations to the specific hardware accelerators being used, whether GPUs or RISC-V architectures, to maximize performance and efficiency.\n- **Memory Prediction and Prefetching**: Use predictive models and hierarchical memory scheduling to reduce memory latency and improve overall system performance.\n\nThese approaches align with the analysis note's insights on the importance of memory hierarchy optimization, hardware-aware computation, and predictive memory access in improving neural network performance.\n",

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n#### 3. MoA: Mixture of Sparse Attention for Automatic Large Language Model Compression (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tianyu Fu, Haofeng Huang, Xuefei Ning, Genghan Zhang, Boju Chen, Tianqi Wu, Hongyi Wang, Zixiao Huang, Shiyao Li, Shengen Yan, Guohao Dai, Huazhong Yang, Yu Wang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Mixture of Attention (MoA) is proposed, which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers, and narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse attention can effectively mitigate the significant memory and throughput demands of Large Language Models (LLMs) in long contexts. Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/38 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nArXiv, abs/2312.00752, 2023.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.01)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.00)\n\n*Aydar Bulatov, Yuri Kuratov, M. Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/29 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nIn 2018 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP), pages 5884-5888, 2018. doi: 10.1109/ICASSP.2018.8462506.

Even rare slip-ups in the policy action outputs can compound quickly over time, since they lead to unfamiliar future states where the policy is still more likely to err, eventually causing task failures. We revisit simple supervised ``behavior cloning'' for conveniently training the policy from nothing more than pre-recorded demonstrations, but carefully design the model class to counter the compounding error phenomenon. Our ``memory-consistent neural network'' (MCNN) outputs are hard-constrained to stay within clearly specified permissible regions anchored to prototypical ``memory'' training samples. We provide a guaranteed upper bound for the sub-optimality gap induced by MCNN policies. Using MCNNs on 10 imitation learning tasks, with MLP, Transformer, and Diffusion backbones, spanning dexterous robotic manipulation and driving, proprioceptive inputs and visual inputs, and varying sizes and types of demonstration data, we find large and consistent gains in performance, validating that MCNNs are better-suited than vanilla deep neural networks for imitation learning applications.

Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory access neural networks*\n\n*Lihao Wang, Zhaofei Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model, which improves the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. PredRNN: Recurrent Neural Networks for Predictive Learning using Spatiotemporal LSTMs\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory access neural networks*\n\n*Yunbo Wang, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A predictive recurrent neural network (PredRNN) that achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on three video prediction datasets and is a more general framework, that can be easily extended to other predictive learning tasks by integrating with other architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** The predictive learning of spatiotemporal sequences aims to generate future images by learning from the historical frames, where spatial appearances and temporal variations are two crucial structures. This paper models these structures by presenting a predictive recurrent neural network (PredRNN). This architecture is enlightened by the idea that spatiotemporal predictive learning should memorize both spatial appearances and temporal variations in a unified memory pool. Concretely, memory states are no longer constrained inside each LSTM unit. Instead, they are allowed to zigzag in two directions: across stacked RNN layers vertically and through all RNN states horizontally. The core of this network is a new Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) unit that extracts and memorizes spatial and temporal representations simultaneously. PredRNN achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on three video prediction datasets and is a more general framework, that can be easily extended to other predictive learning tasks by integrating with other architectures.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 663  (*Influential: 100*)\n\n#### 4. Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator optimization techniques*\n\n*Aviral Kumar, A. Yazdanbakhsh, Milad Hashemi, Kevin Swersky, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a\"simulation-driven\"approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a\"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5. Integrated Hardware Architecture and Device Placement Search\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator optimization techniques*\n\n*Irene Wang, Jakub Tarnawski, Amar Phanishayee, Divya Mahajan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first work to explore the co-optimization of determining the optimal architecture and device placement strategy through novel algorithms, improving the balance of computational resources, memory usage, and data distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** Distributed execution of deep learning training involves a dynamic interplay between hardware accelerator architecture and device placement strategy. This is the first work to explore the co-optimization of determining the optimal architecture and device placement strategy through novel algorithms, improving the balance of computational resources, memory usage, and data distribution. Our architecture search leverages tensor and vector units, determining their quantity and dimensionality, and on-chip and off-chip memory configurations. It also determines the microbatch size and decides whether to recompute or stash activations, balancing the memory footprint of training and storage size. For each explored architecture configuration, we use an Integer Linear Program (ILP) to find the optimal schedule for executing operators on the accelerator. The ILP results then integrate with a dynamic programming solution to identify the most effective device placement strategy, combining data, pipeline, and tensor model parallelism across multiple accelerators. Our approach achieves higher throughput on large language models compared to the state-of-the-art TPUv4 and the Spotlight accelerator search framework.

Revisiting Sampling for Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator optimization techniques*\n\n*Haoran Sun, Katayoon Goshvadi, Azade Nova, D. Schuurmans, H. Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper revisits the idea of using sampling for combinatorial optimization, motivated by the significant recent advances of gradient-based discrete MCMC and new techniques for parallel neighborhood exploration on accelerators and finds that modern sampling strategies can leverage landscape information to provide general-purpose solvers that require no training and yet are competitive with state of the art combinatorsial solvers.\n\n**Abstract:** Sampling approaches like Markov chain Monte Carlo were once popular for combinatorial optimization, but the inefficiency of classical meth-ods and the need for problem-specific designs curtailed ongoing develpment. Recent work has favored data-driven approaches that mitigate the need for hand-craft heuristics, but these are often not usable as out-of-the-box solvers due to dependence on in-distribution training and limited scalability to large instances. In this paper, we revisit the idea of using sampling for combinatorial optimization, motivated by the significant recent advances of gradient-based discrete MCMC and new techniques for parallel neighborhood exploration on accelerators. Remarkably, we find that modern sampling strategies can leverage landscape information to provide general-purpose solvers that require no training and yet are competitive with state of the art combinatorial solvers. In particular, experiments on cover vertex selection, graph partition and routing demonstrate better speed-quality trade-offs over current learning based approaches, and sometimes even superior performance to commercial solvers and specialized algorithms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. Simultaneous embedding of multiple attractor manifolds in a recurrent neural network using constrained gradient optimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling memory patterns*\n\n*Haggai Agmon, Y. Burak*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that it is possible to dramatically attenuate these detrimental interference effects by adjusting the synaptic weights, derived from a loss function that quantifies the roughness of the energy landscape along each of the embedded attractor manifolds.\n\n**Abstract:** The storage of continuous variables in working memory is hypothesized to be sustained in the brain by the dynamics of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) whose steady states form continuous manifolds. In some cases, it is thought that the synaptic connectivity supports multiple attractor manifolds, each mapped to a different context or task. For example, in hippocampal area CA3, positions in distinct environments are represented by distinct sets of population activity patterns, each forming a continuum. It has been argued that the embedding of multiple continuous attractors in a single RNN inevitably causes detrimental interference: quenched noise in the synaptic connectivity disrupts the continuity of each attractor, replacing it by a discrete set of steady states that can be conceptualized as lying on local minima of an abstract energy landscape. Consequently, population activity patterns exhibit systematic drifts towards one of these discrete minima, thereby degrading the stored memory over time. Here we show that it is possible to dramatically attenuate these detrimental interference effects by adjusting the synaptic weights. Synaptic weight adjustments are derived from a loss function that quantifies the roughness of the energy landscape along each of the embedded attractor manifolds. By minimizing this loss function, the stability of states can be dramatically improved, without compromising the capacity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. The Dual Form of Neural Networks Revisited: Connecting Test Time Predictions to Training Patterns via Spotlights of Attention\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling memory patterns*\n\n*Kazuki Irie, R'obert Csord'as, J. Schmidhuber*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work conducts experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi- task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discusses potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear layers in neural networks (NNs) trained by gradient descent can be expressed as a key-value memory system which stores all training datapoints and the initial weights, and produces outputs using unnormalised dot attention over the entire training experience. While this has been technically known since the 1960s, no prior work has effectively studied the operations of NNs in such a form, presumably due to prohibitive time and space complexities and impractical model sizes, all of them growing linearly with the number of training patterns which may get very large. However, this dual formulation offers a possibility of directly visualising how an NN makes use of training patterns at test time, by examining the corresponding attention weights. We conduct experiments on small scale supervised image classification tasks in single-task, multi-task, and continual learning settings, as well as language modelling, and discuss potentials and limits of this view for better understanding and interpreting how NNs exploit training patterns.

PRES: Toward Scalable Memory-Based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling memory patterns*\n\n*Junwei Su, Difan Zou, Chuan Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Memory-based Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (MDGNNs) are a family of dynamic graph neural networks that leverage a memory module to extract, distill, and memorize long-term temporal dependencies, leading to superior performance compared to memory-less counterparts. However, training MDGNNs faces the challenge of handling entangled temporal and structural dependencies, requiring sequential and chronological processing of data sequences to capture accurate temporal patterns. During the batch training, the temporal data points within the same batch will be processed in parallel, while their temporal dependencies are neglected. This issue is referred to as temporal discontinuity and restricts the effective temporal batch size, limiting data parallelism and reducing MDGNNs' flexibility in industrial applications. This paper studies the efficient training of MDGNNs at scale, focusing on the temporal discontinuity in training MDGNNs with large temporal batch sizes. We first conduct a theoretical study on the impact of temporal batch size on the convergence of MDGNN training. Based on the analysis, we propose PRES, an iterative prediction-correction scheme combined with a memory coherence learning objective to mitigate the effect of temporal discontinuity, enabling MDGNNs to be trained with significantly larger temporal batches without sacrificing generalization performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables up to a 4x larger temporal batch (3.4x speed-up) during MDGNN training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. HarDNet: A Low Memory Traffic Network\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory access neural networks*\n\n*Youn-Long Lin, Chien-Hsiang Huang, Yu-Shan Ruan, Chao-Yang Kao, Ping Chao*\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art neural network architectures such as ResNet, MobileNet, and DenseNet have achieved outstanding accuracy over low MACs and small model size counterparts. However, these metrics might not be accurate for predicting the inference time. We suggest that memory traffic for accessing intermediate feature maps can be a factor dominating the inference latency, especially in such tasks as real-time object detection and semantic segmentation of high-resolution video. We propose a Harmonic Densely Connected Network to achieve high efficiency in terms of both low MACs and memory traffic. The new network achieves 35%, 36%, 30%, 32%, and 45% inference time reduction compared with FC-DenseNet-103, DenseNet-264, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, and SSD-VGG, respectively. We use tools including Nvidia profiler and ARM Scale-Sim to measure the memory traffic and verify that the inference latency is indeed proportional to the memory traffic consumption and the proposed network consumes low memory traffic. We conclude that one should take memory traffic into consideration when designing neural network architectures for high-resolution applications at the edge.\n\n**Conference:** hardnet-a-low-memory-traffic-network-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-03\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Universal Checkpointing: Efficient and Flexible Checkpointing for Large Scale Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator optimization techniques*\n\n*Minjia Zhang, Olatunji Ruwase, Stas Bekman, Masahiro Tanaka, Lev Kurilenko, Sam Ade Jacobs, Xinyu Lian*\n\n**Abstract:** Existing checkpointing approaches seem ill-suited for distributed training even though hardware limitations make model parallelism, i.e., sharding model state across multiple accelerators, a requirement for model scaling. Consolidating distributed model state into a single checkpoint unacceptably slows down training, and is impractical at extreme scales. Distributed checkpoints, in contrast, are tightly coupled to the model parallelism and hardware configurations of the training run, and thus unusable on different configurations. To address this problem, we propose Universal Checkpointing, a technique that enables efficient checkpoint creation while providing the flexibility of resuming on arbitrary parallelism strategy and hardware configurations. Universal Checkpointing unlocks unprecedented capabilities for large-scale training such as improved resilience to hardware failures through continued training on remaining healthy hardware, and reduced training time through opportunistic exploitation of elastic capacity. The key insight of Universal Checkpointing is the selection of the optimal representation in each phase of the checkpointing life cycle: distributed representation for saving, and consolidated representation for loading. This is achieved using two key mechanisms. First, the universal checkpoint format, which consists of a consolidated representation of each model parameter and metadata for mapping parameter fragments into training ranks of arbitrary model-parallelism configuration. Second, the universal checkpoint language, a simple but powerful specification language for converting distributed checkpoints into the universal checkpoint format. Our evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of Universal Checkpointing on state-of-the-art model architectures and a wide range of parallelism techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. PACT: Parameterized Clipping Activation for Quantized Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware accelerator optimization techniques*\n\n*Pierce I-Jen Chuang, Jungwook Choi, Zhuo Wang, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Kailash Gopalakrishnan, Swagath Venkataramani*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning algorithms achieve high classification accuracy at the expense\nof significant computation cost. To address this cost, a number of quantization\nschemes have been proposed - but most of these techniques focused on quantizing\nweights, which are relatively smaller in size compared to activations. This\npaper proposes a novel quantization scheme for activations during training -\nthat enables neural networks to work well with ultra low precision weights and\nactivations without any significant accuracy degradation. This technique,\nPArameterized Clipping acTivation (PACT), uses an activation clipping parameter\n$\\alpha$ that is optimized during training to find the right quantization\nscale. PACT allows quantizing activations to arbitrary bit precisions, while\nachieving much better accuracy relative to published state-of-the-art\nquantization schemes. We show, for the first time, that both weights and\nactivations can be quantized to 4-bits of precision while still achieving\naccuracy comparable to full precision networks across a range of popular models\nand datasets. We also show that exploiting these reduced-precision\ncomputational units in hardware can enable a super-linear improvement in\ninferencing performance due to a significant reduction in the area of\naccelerator compute engines coupled with the ability to retain the quantized\nmodel and activation data in on-chip memories.\n\n**Conference:** pact-parameterized-clipping-activation-for-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-05-16\n\n\n\n#### 5. Fast inference with Kronecker-sparse matrices\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling memory patterns*\n\n*Quoc-Tung Le, Pascal Carrivain, L\u00e9on Zheng, Antoine Gonon*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper benchmarks and improves existing GPU matrix multiplication algorithms specialized for Kronecker-sparse matrices, whose sparsity patterns are described by Kronecker products. These matrices have recently gained popularity as replacements for dense matrices in neural networks because they preserve accuracy while using fewer parameters. We present the first energy and time benchmarks for the multiplication with such matrices, helping users identify scenarios where Kronecker-sparse matrices are more time- and energy-efficient than their dense counterparts. Our benchmark also reveals that specialized implementations spend up to 50% of their total runtime on memory rewriting operations. To address the challenge of reducing memory transfers, we introduce a new so-called tiling strategy adapted to the Kronecker-sparsity structure, which reduces reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We implement this tiling strategy in a new CUDA kernel that achieves a median speed-up of x1.4, while also cutting energy consumption by 15%. We further demonstrate the broader impact of our results by applying the new kernel to accelerate transformer inference.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-23\n\n\n\n#### 6. Near Optimal Solving of the (N2-1)-puzzle Using Heuristics Based on Artificial Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network tiling memory patterns*\n\n*Pavel Surynek, Vojtech Cahlik*\n\n**Abstract:** We address the design of heuristics for near-optimal solving of the (N2\u20131)-puzzle using the A* search algorithm in this paper. The A* search algorithm explores configurations of the puzzle in the order determined by a heuristic that tries to estimate the minimum number of moves needed to reach the goal from the given configuration. To guarantee finding an optimal solution, the A* algorithm requires heuristics that estimate the number of moves from below. Common heuristics for the (N2\u20131)-puzzle often underestimate the true number of moves greatly in order to meet the admissibility requirement. The worse the estimation is the more configurations the search algorithm needs to explore. We therefore relax from the admissibility requirement and design a novel heuristic that tries estimating the minimum number of moves remaining as precisely as possible while overestimation of the true distance is permitted. Our heuristic called ANN-distance is based on a deep artificial neural network (ANN). We experimentally show that with a well trained ANN-distance heuristic, whose inputs are just the positions of the tiles, we are able to achieve better accuracy of estimation than with conventional heuristics such as those derived from the Manhattan distance or pattern database heuristics. Though we cannot guarantee admissibility of ANN-distance due to possible overestimation of the true number of moves, an experimental evaluation on random 15-puzzles shows that in most cases the ANN-distance calculates the true minimum distance from the goal or an estimation that is very close to the true distance. Consequently, A* search with the ANN-distance heuristic usually finds an optimal solution or a solution that is very close to the optimum. Moreover, the underlying neural network in ANN-distance consumes much less memory than a comparable pattern database. We also show that a deep artificial neural network can be more powerful than a shallow artificial neural network, and also trained our heuristic to prefer underestimating the optimal solution cost, which pushed the solutions towards better optimality.\n\n**Proceeding:** international-joint-conference-on-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on predictive memory access, hardware accelerator optimization, and novel tiling strategies, here are some specific examples and implementation details based on the provided analysis and additional research:\n\n## Predictive Memory Access Implementations in Neural Networks\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Scheduling with Predictive Prefetching\nThe work by Wang et al. on \"Memory-Centric Neural Network Design\" highlights the use of hierarchical memory scheduling with predictive prefetching.

This approach is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes and requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention algorithms.\n\n### Tiling and Caching Strategies\nThe analysis note highlights the importance of tiling and caching strategies for performance optimization. By dividing the computation into smaller tiles and optimizing the memory access patterns within these tiles, significant reductions in memory latency and improvements in overall performance can be achieved. This is particularly relevant when balancing between different memory levels such as HBM, SRAM, and cache[3,.\n\n## Methods for Integrating Hardware-Specific Optimizations into Existing Architectures\n\n### Backward Compatibility and Hardware-Agnostic Design\nTo integrate hardware-specific optimizations, it is crucial to maintain backward compatibility while ensuring the design is hardware-agnostic but hardware-optimizable. This involves creating clear interfaces for hardware-specific optimizations and flexible computation scheduling that can adapt to different hardware accelerators[3,.\n\n### Co-Design and Neural Architecture Search\nIntegrating neural architecture search with hardware constraints, as discussed by Zhang et al., allows for the development of neural blocks that are optimized for the target hardware. This co-design approach ensures that the neural architecture is tailored to the specific capabilities and limitations of the hardware, leading to better performance and efficiency.\n\nBy leveraging these strategies, researchers can significantly improve the design of autoregressive language models, focusing on predictive memory access, hardware accelerator optimization, and novel tiling strategies to enhance performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Simple linear attention language models balance the recall-throughput tradeoff (Avg.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

Chan, Andrea Banino, Felix Hill*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 38  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures), and is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n**Abstract:** Reinforcement learning agents often forget details of the past, especially after delays or distractor tasks. Agents with common memory architectures struggle to recall and integrate across multiple timesteps of a past event, or even to recall the details of a single timestep that is followed by distractor tasks. To address these limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Chunk Attention Memory (HCAM), which helps agents to remember the past in detail. HCAM stores memories by dividing the past into chunks, and recalls by first performing high-level attention over coarse summaries of the chunks, and then performing detailed attention within only the most relevant chunks. An agent with HCAM can therefore\"mentally time-travel\"-- remember past events in detail without attending to all intervening events. We show that agents with HCAM substantially outperform agents with other memory architectures at tasks requiring long-term recall, retention, or reasoning over memory. These include recalling where an object is hidden in a 3D environment, rapidly learning to navigate efficiently in a new neighborhood, and rapidly learning and retaining new object names. Agents with HCAM can extrapolate to task sequences much longer than they were trained on, and can even generalize zero-shot from a meta-learning setting to maintaining knowledge across episodes. HCAM improves agent sample efficiency, generalization, and generality (by solving tasks that previously required specialized architectures). Our work is a step towards agents that can learn, interact, and adapt in complex and temporally-extended environments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2101.03961, 2021.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/19 (Score: 0.03)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1811.02084, 2018.

Autaptic Synaptic Circuit Enhances Spatio-temporal Predictive Learning of Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Lihao Wang, Zhaofei Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model, which improves the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) emulate the integrated-fire-leak mechanism found in biological neurons, offering a compelling combination of biological realism and energy efficiency. In recent years, they have gained considerable research interest. However, existing SNNs predominantly rely on the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) model and are primarily suited for simple, static tasks. They lack the ability to effectively model long-term temporal dependencies and facilitate spatial information interaction, which is crucial for tackling complex, dynamic spatio-temporal prediction tasks. To tackle these challenges, this paper draws inspiration from the concept of autaptic synapses in biology and proposes a novel Spatio-Temporal Circuit (STC) model. The STC model integrates two learnable adaptive pathways, enhancing the spiking neurons' temporal memory and spatial coordination. We conduct a theoretical analysis of the dynamic parameters in the STC model, highlighting their contribution in establishing long-term memory and mitigating the issue of gradient vanishing. Through extensive experiments on multiple spatio-temporal prediction datasets, we demonstrate that our model outperforms other adaptive models. Furthermore, our model is compatible with existing spiking neuron models, thereby augmenting their dynamic representations. In essence, our work enriches the specificity and topological complexity of SNNs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. PredRNN: Recurrent Neural Networks for Predictive Learning using Spatiotemporal LSTMs\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Yunbo Wang, Mingsheng Long, Jianmin Wang, Zhifeng Gao, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A predictive recurrent neural network (PredRNN) that achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on three video prediction datasets and is a more general framework, that can be easily extended to other predictive learning tasks by integrating with other architectures.\n\n**Abstract:** The predictive learning of spatiotemporal sequences aims to generate future images by learning from the historical frames, where spatial appearances and temporal variations are two crucial structures. This paper models these structures by presenting a predictive recurrent neural network (PredRNN). This architecture is enlightened by the idea that spatiotemporal predictive learning should memorize both spatial appearances and temporal variations in a unified memory pool. Concretely, memory states are no longer constrained inside each LSTM unit. Instead, they are allowed to zigzag in two directions: across stacked RNN layers vertically and through all RNN states horizontally. The core of this network is a new Spatiotemporal LSTM (ST-LSTM) unit that extracts and memorizes spatial and temporal representations simultaneously. PredRNN achieves the state-of-the-art prediction performance on three video prediction datasets and is a more general framework, that can be easily extended to other predictive learning tasks by integrating with other architectures.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 663  (*Influential: 100*)\n\n#### 3.

Wenliang, Elliot Catt, Marcus Hutter, S. Legg, Pedro A. Ortega*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs, including negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Reliable generalization lies at the heart of safe ML and AI. However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 100  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 4. Clinical Note Owns its Hierarchy: Multi-Level Hypergraph Neural Networks for Patient-Level Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: multi-level tiling strategies neural networks*\n\n*Nayeon Kim, Yinhua Piao, Sun Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** A taxonomy-aware multi- level hypergraph neural network (TM-HGNN), where multi-level hypergraphs assemble useful neutral words with rare keywords via note and taxonomy level hyperedges to retain the clinical semantic information, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging knowledge from electronic health records (EHRs) to predict a patient\u2019s condition is essential to the effective delivery of appropriate care. Clinical notes of patient EHRs contain valuable information from healthcare professionals, but have been underused due to their difficult contents and complex hierarchies. Recently, hypergraph-based methods have been proposed for document classifications. Directly adopting existing hypergraph methods on clinical notes cannot sufficiently utilize the hierarchy information of the patient, which can degrade clinical semantic information by (1) frequent neutral words and (2) hierarchies with imbalanced distribution. Thus, we propose a taxonomy-aware multi-level hypergraph neural network (TM-HGNN), where multi-level hypergraphs assemble useful neutral words with rare keywords via note and taxonomy level hyperedges to retain the clinical semantic information. The constructed patient hypergraphs are fed into hierarchical message passing layers for learning more balanced multi-level knowledge at the note and taxonomy levels. We validate the effectiveness of TM-HGNN by conducting extensive experiments with MIMIC-III dataset on benchmark in-hospital-mortality prediction.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Multi-Layer Neural Networks as Trainable Ladders of Hilbert Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: multi-level tiling strategies neural networks*\n\n*Zhengdao Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A correspondence between functions expressed by L -layer NNs and those belonging to L -level NHLs is proved and generalization guarantees for learning the NHL based on a new complexity measure are proved.\n\n**Abstract:** To characterize the functions spaces explored by multi-layer neural networks (NNs), we introduce Neural Hilbert Ladders (NHLs), a collection of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSes) that are defined iteratively and adaptive to training. First, we prove a correspondence between functions expressed by L -layer NNs and those belonging to L -level NHLs. Second, we prove generalization guarantees for learning the NHL based on a new complexity measure. Third, corresponding to the training of multi-layer NNs in the infinite-width mean-field limit, we derive an evolution of the NHL characterized by the dynamics of multiple random fields. Finally, we examine linear and shallow NNs from the new perspective and complement the theory with numerical results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Cremers*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel calibration method named Graph Attention Temperature Scaling (GATS), which is tailored for calibrating graph neural networks and incorporates designs that address all the identified influential factors and produces nodewise temperature scaling using an attention-based architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** Given the importance of getting calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimations, various post-hoc calibration methods have been developed for neural networks on standard multi-class classification tasks. However, these methods are not well suited for calibrating graph neural networks (GNNs), which presents unique challenges such as accounting for the graph structure and the graph-induced correlations between the nodes. In this work, we conduct a systematic study on the calibration qualities of GNN node predictions. In particular, we identify five factors which influence the calibration of GNNs: general under-confident tendency, diversity of nodewise predictive distributions, distance to training nodes, relative confidence level, and neighborhood similarity. Furthermore, based on the insights from this study, we design a novel calibration method named Graph Attention Temperature Scaling (GATS), which is tailored for calibrating graph neural networks. GATS incorporates designs that address all the identified influential factors and produces nodewise temperature scaling using an attention-based architecture. GATS is accuracy-preserving, data-efficient, and expressive at the same time. Our experiments empirically verify the effectiveness of GATS, demonstrating that it can consistently achieve state-of-the-art calibration results on various graph datasets for different GNN backbones.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7. Towards Theoretically Inspired Neural Initialization Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific neural optimization techniques*\n\n*Yibo Yang, Hong Wang, Haobo Yuan, Zhouchen Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a differentiable quantity, named GradCosine, with theoretical insights to evaluate the initial state of a neural network, and proposes the neural initialization optimization (NIO) algorithm, able to automatically look for a better initialization with negligible cost compared with the training time.\n\n**Abstract:** Automated machine learning has been widely explored to reduce human efforts in designing neural architectures and looking for proper hyperparameters. In the domain of neural initialization, however, similar automated techniques have rarely been studied. Most existing initialization methods are handcrafted and highly dependent on specific architectures. In this paper, we propose a differentiable quantity, named GradCosine, with theoretical insights to evaluate the initial state of a neural network. Specifically, GradCosine is the cosine similarity of sample-wise gradients with respect to the initialized parameters. By analyzing the sample-wise optimization landscape, we show that both the training and test performance of a network can be improved by maximizing GradCosine under gradient norm constraint. Based on this observation, we further propose the neural initialization optimization (NIO) algorithm. Generalized from the sample-wise analysis into the real batch setting, NIO is able to automatically look for a better initialization with negligible cost compared with the training time. With NIO, we improve the classification performance of a variety of neural architectures on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Moreover, we find that our method can even help to train large vision Transformer architecture without warmup.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific neural optimization techniques*\n\n*Y.

However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Existing methods either search for neural architectures in heuristic design spaces or apply low-level adjustments to computation primitives to improve inference efficiency on hardware. We present Automated Graph Optimization (AutoGO), a framework to evolve neural networks in a low-level Computation Graph (CG) of primitive operations to improve both its performance and hardware friendliness. Through a tokenization scheme, AutoGO performs variable-sized segment mutations, making both primitive changes and larger-grained changes to CGs. We introduce our segmentation and mutation algorithms, efficient frequent segment mining technique, as well as a pretrained context-aware predictor to estimate the impact of segment replacements. Extensive experimental results show that AutoGO can automatically evolve several typical large convolutional networks to achieve significant task performance improvement and FLOPs reduction on a range of CV tasks, ranging from Classification, Semantic Segmentation, Human Pose Estimation, to Super Resolution, yet without introducing any newer primitive operations. We also demonstrate the lightweight deployment results of AutoGO-optimized super-resolution and denoising U-Nets on a cycle simulator for a Neural Processing Unit (NPU), achieving PSNR improvement and latency/power reduction simultaneously.

PaCKD: Pattern-Clustered Knowledge Distillation for Compressing Memory Access Prediction Models\n\n*From Search Query: predictive memory prefetching neural networks*\n\n*Viktor Prasanna, Rajgopal Kannan, Pengmiao Zhang, Neelesh Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) have proven to be effective models for accurate Memory Access Prediction (MAP), a critical task in mitigating memory latency through data prefetching. However, existing DNN-based MAP models suffer from the challenges such as significant physical storage space and poor inference latency, primarily due to their large number of parameters. These limitations render them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose PaCKD, a Pattern-Clustered Knowledge Distillation approach to compress MAP models while maintaining the prediction performance. The PaCKD approach encompasses three steps: clustering memory access sequences into distinct partitions involving similar patterns, training large pattern-specific teacher models for memory access prediction for each partition, and training a single lightweight student model by distilling the knowledge from the trained pattern-specific teachers. We evaluate our approach on LSTM, MLP-Mixer, and ResNet models, as they exhibit diverse structures and are widely used for image classification tasks in order to test their effectiveness in four widely used graph applications. Compared to the teacher models with 5.406M parameters and an F1-score of 0.4626, our student models achieve a 552$\\times$ model size compression while maintaining an F1-score of 0.4538 (with a 1.92% performance drop). Our approach yields an 8.70% higher result compared to student models trained with standard knowledge distillation and an 8.88% higher result compared to student models trained without any form of knowledge distillation.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-21\n\n\n\n#### 2. Accurate, Large Minibatch SGD: Training ImageNet in 1 Hour\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific neural optimization techniques*\n\n*Piotr Doll\u00e1r, Priya Goyal, Pieter Noordhuis, Andrew Tulloch, Ross Girshick, Lukasz Wesolowski, Aapo Kyrola, Yangqing Jia, Kaiming He*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning thrives with large neural networks and large datasets. However,\nlarger networks and larger datasets result in longer training times that impede\nresearch and development progress. Distributed synchronous SGD offers a\npotential solution to this problem by dividing SGD minibatches over a pool of\nparallel workers. Yet to make this scheme efficient, the per-worker workload\nmust be large, which implies nontrivial growth in the SGD minibatch size. In\nthis paper, we empirically show that on the ImageNet dataset large minibatches\ncause optimization difficulties, but when these are addressed the trained\nnetworks exhibit good generalization. Specifically, we show no loss of accuracy\nwhen training with large minibatch sizes up to 8192 images. To achieve this\nresult, we adopt a hyper-parameter-free linear scaling rule for adjusting\nlearning rates as a function of minibatch size and develop a new warmup scheme\nthat overcomes optimization challenges early in training. With these simple\ntechniques, our Caffe2-based system trains ResNet-50 with a minibatch size of\n8192 on 256 GPUs in one hour, while matching small minibatch accuracy. Using\ncommodity hardware, our implementation achieves ~90% scaling efficiency when\nmoving from 8 to 256 GPUs. Our findings enable training visual recognition\nmodels on internet-scale data with high efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2017-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Programmable Approach to Neural Network Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific neural optimization techniques*\n\n*Saurav Muralidharan, Vinu Joseph, Michael Garland, Animesh Garg, Ganesh Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks (DNNs) frequently contain far more weights, represented at a higher precision, than are required for the specific task which they are trained to perform. Consequently, they can often be compressed using techniques such as weight pruning and quantization that reduce both the model size and inference time without appreciable loss in accuracy. However, finding the best compression strategy and corresponding target sparsity for a given DNN, hardware platform, and optimization objective currently requires expensive, frequently manual, trial-and-error experimentation. In this paper, we introduce a programmable system for model compression called Condensa. Users programmatically compose simple operators, in Python, to build more complex and practically interesting compression strategies. Given a strategy and user-provided objective (such as minimization of running time), Condensa uses a novel Bayesian optimization-based algorithm to automatically infer desirable sparsities. Our experiments on four real-world DNNs demonstrate memory footprint and hardware runtime throughput improvements of 188x and 2.59x, respectively, using at most ten samples per search. We have released a reference implementation of Condensa at https://github.com/NVlabs/condensa.\n\n**Published:** 2019-11-06\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware efficiency, memory optimization, and integration of hardware-specific optimizations, here are some specific techniques and implementation details based on the provided keywords and analysis:\n\n## Predictive Memory Prefetching in Neural Networks\n\nPredictive memory prefetching is crucial for reducing latency and improving performance in neural networks. Here are some key points:\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Scheduling**: Implementing hierarchical memory scheduling with predictive prefetching can reduce memory latency significantly. For example, a study mentioned in the analysis notes that such techniques can reduce memory latency by up to 60% while maintaining model accuracy.\n- **Prefetching Techniques**: Prefetching involves anticipating data needs and loading data into cache before it is requested by the processor. This technique is similar to how a CPU's cache operates and can be particularly effective in reducing latency.\n\n## Multi-Level Tiling Strategies\n\nMulti-level tiling strategies are essential for balancing computation and memory access patterns:\n\n- **IO-Aware Tiling**: Techniques like FlashAttention use tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between different levels of memory hierarchy (e.g., GPU high bandwidth memory and on-chip SRAM). This approach optimizes memory access patterns and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n- **Multi-Level Memory Hierarchy**: Tiling strategies should consider the entire memory hierarchy, optimizing data movement between different levels of memory. This includes optimizing tile sizes to match the available memory resources and minimizing the number of memory accesses.\n\n## Methods for Integrating Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\nIntegrating hardware-specific optimizations while maintaining model correctness is vital:\n\n- **Hardware-Neural Co-Design**: This approach involves integrating neural architecture search with hardware constraints to design optimal hardware-specific neural blocks. This method ensures that the neural network architecture is tailored to the capabilities of the hardware, leading to better performance and efficiency.\n- **Flexible Architecture**: Designing a flexible architecture that can adapt to different hardware is crucial. This involves creating a hardware-agnostic interface that can incorporate hardware-specific optimizations without compromising model correctness.\n\n## Approaches for Efficient Memory Hierarchy Utilization\n\nEfficient utilization of the memory hierarchy is key to optimizing neural network performance:\n\n- **Memory Caching Strategies**: Implementing memory caching strategies such as eviction and regeneration, recomputation, and quantization can significantly reduce memory usage. These techniques involve storing frequently accessed data in faster storage systems, offloading data to free up memory, and recalculating certain values instead of storing them.\n- **Activation Checkpointing**: This technique reduces memory usage by clearing activations of certain layers and recomputing them during the backward pass. It trades extra computation time for reduced memory usage, which is particularly useful in large models.\n- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Techniques like PagedAttention optimize memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks, alleviating memory constraints during inference. Pruning unnecessary connections within the neural network can also result in a lighter model without significantly impacting performance.\n\n## Implementation Considerations\n\nWhen implementing these techniques, several considerations are important:\n\n- **Balance Between Optimization Complexity and Performance Gain**: The complexity of the optimization techniques should be balanced against the performance gain to ensure that the overall system remains efficient and maintainable.\n- **Maintaining Model Correctness**: Any optimization technique must ensure that the model's correctness and accuracy are not compromised. This involves careful testing and validation of the optimized models.\n- **Hardware-Agnostic Interface**: Designing a hardware-agnostic interface allows for the incorporation of hardware-specific optimizations without requiring significant changes to the model architecture.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 31/52 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Score: 0.77)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

SpikeGPT: Generative Pre-trained Language Model with Spiking Neural Networks (Avg. Score: 0.65)\n\n*Rui Zhu, Qihang Zhao, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 54  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper successfully implements `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units, and is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language.\n\n**Abstract:** As the size of large language models continue to scale, so does the computational resources required to run it. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have emerged as an energy-efficient approach to deep learning that leverage sparse and event-driven activations to reduce the computational overhead associated with model inference. While they have become competitive with non-spiking models on many computer vision tasks, SNNs have also proven to be more challenging to train. As a result, their performance lags behind modern deep learning, and we are yet to see the effectiveness of SNNs in language generation. In this paper, inspired by the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) language model, we successfully implement `SpikeGPT', a generative language model with binary, event-driven spiking activation units. We train the proposed model on two model variants: 45M and 216M parameters. To the best of our knowledge, SpikeGPT is the largest backpropagation-trained SNN model to date, rendering it suitable for both the generation and comprehension of natural language. We achieve this by modifying the transformer block to replace multi-head self attention to reduce quadratic computational complexity O(N^2) to linear complexity O(N) with increasing sequence length. Input tokens are instead streamed in sequentially to our attention mechanism (as with typical SNNs). Our preliminary experiments show that SpikeGPT remains competitive with non-spiking models on tested benchmarks, while maintaining 20x fewer operations when processed on neuromorphic hardware that can leverage sparse, event-driven activations. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/SpikeGPT.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/43 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP), pp. $1631-1642,2013$.

Compressing LLMs: The Truth is Rarely Pure and Never Simple\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training-Free Compression in Language Models\"*\n\n*A. Jaiswal, Zhe Gan, Xianzhi Du, Bowen Zhang, Zhangyang Wang, Yinfei Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Knowledge-Intensive Compressed LLM BenchmarK (LLM-KICK), a collection of carefully curated tasks to redefine the evaluation protocol for compressed LLMs, which have significant alignment with their dense counterparts and perplexity fail to capture subtle change in their true capabilities.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite their remarkable achievements, modern Large Language Models (LLMs) face exorbitant computational and memory footprints. Recently, several works have shown significant success in training-free and data-free compression (pruning and quantization) of LLMs that achieve 50 - 60% sparsity and reduce the bit width to 3 or 4 bits per weight, with negligible degradation of perplexity over the uncompressed baseline. As recent research efforts are focused on developing increasingly sophisticated compression methods, our work takes a step back and re-evaluates the effectiveness of existing SoTA compression methods, which rely on a fairly simple and widely questioned metric, perplexity (even for dense LLMs). We introduce Knowledge-Intensive Compressed LLM BenchmarK (LLM-KICK), a collection of carefully curated tasks to redefine the evaluation protocol for compressed LLMs, which have significant alignment with their dense counterparts and perplexity fail to capture subtle change in their true capabilities. LLM-KICK unveils many favorable merits and unfortunate plights of current SoTA compression methods: all pruning methods suffer significant performance degradation, sometimes at trivial sparsity ratios (e.g., 25-30%), and fail for N:M sparsity in knowledge-intensive tasks; current quantization methods are more successful than pruning; yet, pruned LLMs even at $\\geq 50$% sparsity are robust in-context retrieval and summarization systems; among others. LLM-KICK is designed to holistically access compressed LLMs' ability for language understanding, reasoning, generation, in-context retrieval, in-context summarization, etc. We hope our study can foster the development of better LLM compression methods.

We find that these methods break down at lower bit precision, and investigate quantization aware training for LLMs (LLM-QAT) to push quantization levels even further. We propose a data-free distillation method that leverages generations produced by the pre-trained model, which better preserves the original output distribution and allows quantizing any generative model independent of its training data, similar to post-training quantization methods. In addition to quantizing weights and activations, we also quantize the KV cache, which is critical for increasing throughput and support long sequence dependencies at current model sizes. We experiment with LLaMA models of sizes 7B, 13B, and 30B, at quantization levels down to 4-bits. We observe large improvements over training-free methods, especially in the low-bit settings.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 119  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 3. LiteTransformerSearch: Training-free Neural Architecture Search for Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training-Free Compression in Language Models\"*\n\n*Mojan Javaheripi, Gustavo de Rosa, Subhabrata Mukherjee, S. Shah, T. L. Religa, C. C. T. Mendes, S\u00e9bastien Bubeck, F. Koushanfar, Debadeepta Dey*\n\n**TL;DR:** The search phase of this training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs and effectively removes the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture is ubiquitously used as the building block of large-scale autoregressive language models. However, finding architectures with the optimal trade-off between task performance (perplexity) and hardware constraints like peak memory utilization and latency is non-trivial. This is exacerbated by the proliferation of various hardware. We leverage the somewhat surprising empirical observation that the number of decoder parameters in autoregressive Transformers has a high rank correlation with task performance, irrespective of the architecture topology. This observation organically induces a simple Neural Architecture Search (NAS) algorithm that uses decoder parameters as a proxy for perplexity without need for any model training. The search phase of our training-free algorithm, dubbed Lightweight Transformer Search (LTS), can be run directly on target devices since it does not require GPUs. Using on-target-device measurements, LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier of perplexity versus any hardware performance cost. We evaluate LTS on diverse devices from ARM CPUs to NVIDIA GPUs and two popular autoregressive Transformer backbones: GPT-2 and Transformer-XL. Results show that the perplexity of 16-layer GPT-2 and Transformer-XL can be achieved with up to 1.5x, 2.5x faster runtime and 1.2x, 2.0x lower peak memory utilization. When evaluated in zero and one-shot settings, LTS Pareto-frontier models achieve higher average accuracy compared to the 350M parameter OPT across 14 tasks, with up to 1.6x lower latency. LTS extracts the Pareto-frontier in under 3 hours while running on a commodity laptop. We effectively remove the carbon footprint of hundreds of GPU hours of training during search, offering a strong simple baseline for future NAS methods in autoregressive language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

While it is a common practice\nto apply a language-agnostic procedure optimizing a joint multilingual task\nobjective, how to properly characterize and take advantage of its underlying\nproblem structure for improving optimization efficiency remains under-explored.\nIn this paper, we attempt to peek into the black-box of multilingual\noptimization through the lens of loss function geometry. We find that gradient\nsimilarity measured along the optimization trajectory is an important signal,\nwhich correlates well with not only language proximity but also the overall\nmodel performance. Such observation helps us to identify a critical limitation\nof existing gradient-based multi-task learning methods, and thus we derive a\nsimple and scalable optimization procedure, named Gradient Vaccine, which\nencourages more geometrically aligned parameter updates for close tasks.\nEmpirically, our method obtains significant model performance gains on\nmultilingual machine translation and XTREME benchmark tasks for multilingual\nlanguage models.

OmniQuant: Omnidirectionally Calibrated Quantization for Large Language\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Quantization Techniques for Transformers\"*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Peng Xu, Lirui Zhao, Zhiqian Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Yu Qiao, Ping Luo*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing\ntasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory\nand computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ)\nmethods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the\ncomputational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters,\nleading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To\ntackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization\n(\\textbf{OmniQuant}) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in\ndiverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of\nPTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant\ncomprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC)\nand Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values\nof weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles\nactivation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations\nto weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error\nminimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for\nboth weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2\nmodel family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G\nGPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate\nOmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations\nsuch as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16.\nAdditionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models\nand delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on\nreal devices.

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Quantization Techniques for Transformers\"*\n\n*Vage Egiazarian, Andrei Panferov, Denis Kuznedelev, Elias Frantar, Artem Babenko, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race\ntowards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on\nend-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM\ncompression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits\nper parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook\nQuantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic\nAdditive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the\nstate-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive\nquantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint\noptimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly,\nAQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of\naccuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and\nsignificantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit)\nregime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU\nimplementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or\noutperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much\nsmaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11T18:54:44Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-11T07:48:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Robustness Challenges in Model Distillation and Pruning for Natural\n  Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training-Free Compression in Language Models\"*\n\n*Mengnan Du, Subhabrata Mukherjee, Yu Cheng, Milad Shokouhi, Xia Hu, Ahmed Hassan Awadallah*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has focused on compressing pre-trained language models (PLMs)\nlike BERT where the major focus has been to improve the in-distribution\nperformance for downstream tasks. However, very few of these studies have\nanalyzed the impact of compression on the generalizability and robustness of\ncompressed models for out-of-distribution (OOD) data. Towards this end, we\nstudy two popular model compression techniques including knowledge distillation\nand pruning and show that the compressed models are significantly less robust\nthan their PLM counterparts on OOD test sets although they obtain similar\nperformance on in-distribution development sets for a task. Further analysis\nindicates that the compressed models overfit on the shortcut samples and\ngeneralize poorly on the hard ones. We further leverage this observation to\ndevelop a regularization strategy for robust model compression based on sample\nuncertainty. Experimental results on several natural language understanding\ntasks demonstrate that our bias mitigation framework improves the OOD\ngeneralization of the compressed models, while not sacrificing the\nin-distribution task performance.\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-16T00:20:04Z  (*Updated: 2023-02-27T03:14:07Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6.

However, little is known\nabout their robustness to minority subgroups defined by the labels and\nattributes of a dataset. In this paper, we investigate the effects of 18\ndifferent compression methods and settings on the subgroup robustness of BERT\nlanguage models. We show that worst-group performance does not depend on model\nsize alone, but also on the compression method used. Additionally, we find that\nmodel compression does not always worsen the performance on minority subgroups.\nAltogether, our analysis serves to further research into the subgroup\nrobustness of model compression.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-26T15:50:37Z  (*Updated: 2024-03-26T15:50:37Z*)\n\n\n\n### 2 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. ZeroQuant: Efficient and Affordable Post-Training Quantization for Large-Scale Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training-Free Compression in Language Models\"*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Conglong Li, Xiaoxia Wu, Minjia Zhang, Reza Yazdani Aminabadi, Zhewei Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** How to efficiently serve ever-larger trained natural language models in practice has become exceptionally challenging even for powerful cloud servers due to their prohibitive memory/computation requirements. In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 2. Parameter-Efficient Sparsity for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Training-Free Compression in Language Models\"*\n\n*Junjie Bai, Shen Li, Songfang Huang, Mengdi Wang, Chuanqi Tan, Fuli Luo, Yuchao Li*\n\n**Abstract:** With the dramatically increased number of parameters in language models, sparsity methods have received ever-increasing research focus to compress and accelerate the models. While most research focuses on how to accurately retain appropriate weights while maintaining the performance of the compressed model, there are challenges in the computational overhead and memory footprint of sparse training when compressing large-scale language models. To address this problem, we propose a Parameter-efficient Sparse Training (PST) method to reduce the number of trainable parameters during sparse-aware training in downstream tasks. Specifically, we first combine the data-free and data-driven criteria to efficiently and accurately measure the importance of weights. Then we investigate the intrinsic redundancy of data-driven weight importance and derive two obvious characteristics i.e., low-rankness and structuredness. Based on that, two groups of small matrices are introduced to compute the data-driven importance of weights, instead of using the original large importance score matrix, which therefore makes the sparse training resource-efficient and parameter-efficient. Experiments with diverse networks (i.e., BERT, RoBERTa and GPT-2) on dozens of datasets demonstrate PST performs on par or better than previous sparsity methods, despite only training a small number of parameters. For instance, compared with previous sparsity methods, our PST only requires 1.5% trainable parameters to achieve comparable performance on BERT.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically enhancing the existing **FastTTTLinear** model, to outperform current state-of-the-art models.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.77)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.55)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

However, the efficiency of attention-based models is bottle-necked during inference by the KV-cache's aggressive memory consumption. In this work, we explore whether we can improve language model efficiency (e.g. by reducing memory consumption) without compromising on recall. By applying experiments and theory to a broad set of architectures, we identify a key tradeoff between a model's state size and recall ability. We show that efficient alternatives to attention (e.g. H3, Mamba, RWKV) maintain a fixed-size recurrent state, but struggle at recall. We propose BASED a simple architecture combining linear and sliding window attention. By varying BASED window size and linear attention feature dimension, we can dial the state size and traverse the pareto frontier of the recall-memory tradeoff curve, recovering the full quality of attention on one end and the small state size of attention-alternatives on the other. We train language models up to 1.3b parameters and show that BASED matches the strongest sub-quadratic models (e.g. Mamba) in perplexity and outperforms them on real-world recall-intensive tasks by 6.22 accuracy points. Implementations of linear attention are often less efficient than optimized standard attention implementations. To make BASED competitive, we develop IO-aware algorithms that enable 24x higher throughput on language generation than FlashAttention-2, when generating 1024 tokens using 1.3b parameter models.

However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error.

Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Adaptive Contrastive Knowledge Distillation for BERT Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Jinyang Guo, Jiaheng Liu, Z. Wang, Yuqing Ma, Ruihao Gong, Ke Xu, Xianglong Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a novel contrastive distillation loss based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features and incorporates this strategy into a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose a new knowledge distillation approach called adaptive contrastive knowledge distillation (ACKD) for BERT compression. Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M. Larson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression, and reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of P AP perturbation.\n\n**Abstract:** Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. VIBE: Topic-Driven Temporal Adaptation for Twitter Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\"*\n\n*Yuji Zhang, Jing Li, Wenjie Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Language features are evolving in real-world social media, resulting in the\ndeteriorating performance of text classification in dynamics. To address this\nchallenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are\ntested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or\nknowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social\nmedia data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent\ntopic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information\nBottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information\nBottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the\ndistinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with\ntimestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes\nretrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data\ntime. Substantial Twitter experiments on three classification tasks show that\nour model, with only 3% of data, significantly outperforms previous\nstate-of-the-art continued-pretraining methods.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-16T08:53:57Z  (*Updated: 2023-11-15T12:41:57Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Latent Diffusion Energy-Based Model for Interpretable Text Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\"*\n\n*Peiyu Yu, Sirui Xie, Xiaojian Ma, Baoxiong Jia, Bo Pang, Ruiqi Gao, Yixin Zhu, Song-Chun Zhu, Ying Nian Wu*\n\n**Abstract:** Latent space Energy-Based Models (EBMs), also known as energy-based priors,\nhave drawn growing interests in generative modeling. Fueled by its flexibility\nin the formulation and strong modeling power of the latent space, recent works\nbuilt upon it have made interesting attempts aiming at the interpretability of\ntext modeling. However, latent space EBMs also inherit some flaws from EBMs in\ndata space; the degenerate MCMC sampling quality in practice can lead to poor\ngeneration quality and instability in training, especially on data with complex\nlatent structures. Inspired by the recent efforts that leverage diffusion\nrecovery likelihood learning as a cure for the sampling issue, we introduce a\nnovel symbiosis between the diffusion models and latent space EBMs in a\nvariational learning framework, coined as the latent diffusion energy-based\nmodel. We develop a geometric clustering-based regularization jointly with the\ninformation bottleneck to further improve the quality of the learned latent\nspace. Experiments on several challenging tasks demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our model on interpretable text modeling over strong\ncounterparts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-13T03:41:31Z  (*Updated: 2023-10-04T22:00:21Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. H-Transformer-1D: Fast One-Dimensional Hierarchical Attention for\n  Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Zhenhai Zhu, Radu Soricut*\n\n**Abstract:** We describe an efficient hierarchical method to compute attention in the\nTransformer architecture.

Treeformer: Dense Gradient Trees for Efficient Attention Computation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Lovish Madaan, Srinadh Bhojanapalli, Himanshu Jain, Prateek Jain*\n\n**Abstract:** Standard inference and training with transformer based architectures scale\nquadratically with input sequence length. This is prohibitively large for a\nvariety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering\netc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup\nattention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as\nsparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we\nview attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use\ndecision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per\nquery token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such\nhierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two\nefficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention\ncomputes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse\nattention layer which also ensures that the gradients are \"dense\". To optimize\nsuch challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training\nmethod. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for\nlong-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost\nas accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the\nattention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12%\nhigher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-18T18:31:40Z  (*Updated: 2023-03-17T14:25:43Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. UNComp: Uncertainty-Aware Long-Context Compressor for Efficient Large\n  Language Model Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Jing Xiong, Jianghan Shen, Fanghua Ye, Chaofan Tao, Zhongwei Wan, Jianqiao Lu, Xun Wu, Chuanyang Zheng, Zhijiang Guo, Lingpeng Kong, Ngai Wong*\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying large language models (LLMs) is challenging due to their high\nmemory and computational demands, especially during long-context inference.\nWhile key-value (KV) caching accelerates inference by reusing previously\ncomputed keys and values, it also introduces significant memory overhead.\nExisting KV cache compression methods such as eviction and merging typically\ncompress the KV cache after it is generated and overlook the eviction of hidden\nstates, failing to improve the speed of the prefilling stage. Additionally,\napplying a uniform compression rate across different attention heads can harm\ncrucial retrieval heads in needle-in-a-haystack tasks due to excessive\ncompression. In this paper, we propose UNComp, an uncertainty-aware compression\nscheme that leverages matrix entropy to estimate model uncertainty across\nlayers and heads at the token sequence level. By grouping layers and heads\nbased on their uncertainty, UNComp adaptively compresses both the hidden states\nand the KV cache. Our method achieves a 1.6x speedup in the prefilling stage\nand reduces the KV cache to 4.74% of its original size, resulting in a 6.4x\nincrease in throughput and a 1.4x speedup in inference with only a 1.41%\nperformance loss. Remarkably, in needle-in-a-haystack tasks, UNComp outperforms\nthe full-size KV cache even when compressed to 9.38% of its original size.

LadaBERT: Lightweight Adaptation of BERT through Hybrid Model\n  Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Yihuan Mao, Yujing Wang, Chufan Wu, Chen Zhang, Yang Wang, Yaming Yang, Quanlu Zhang, Yunhai Tong, Jing Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** BERT is a cutting-edge language representation model pre-trained by a large\ncorpus, which achieves superior performances on various natural language\nunderstanding tasks. However, a major blocking issue of applying BERT to online\nservices is that it is memory-intensive and leads to unsatisfactory latency of\nuser requests, raising the necessity of model compression. Existing solutions\nleverage the knowledge distillation framework to learn a smaller model that\nimitates the behaviors of BERT. However, the training procedure of knowledge\ndistillation is expensive itself as it requires sufficient training data to\nimitate the teacher model. In this paper, we address this issue by proposing a\nhybrid solution named LadaBERT (Lightweight adaptation of BERT through hybrid\nmodel compression), which combines the advantages of different model\ncompression methods, including weight pruning, matrix factorization and\nknowledge distillation. LadaBERT achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on various\npublic datasets while the training overheads can be reduced by an order of\nmagnitude.\n\n**Published:** 2020-04-08T17:18:56Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T15:15:11Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\"*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Nitesh B. Gundavarapu, Yoshua Bengio, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Kshitij Gupta, Aniket Didolkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Temporal Latent Bottleneck\"*\n\n*Adelle Coster, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Lincan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.

Neighborhood Attention Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Humphrey Shi, Shen Li, Jiachen Li, Steven Walton, Ali Hassani*\n\n**Abstract:** We present Neighborhood Attention (NA), the first efficient and scalable sliding-window attention mechanism for vision. NA is a pixel-wise operation, localizing self attention (SA) to the nearest neighboring pixels, and therefore enjoys a linear time and space complexity compared to the quadratic complexity of SA. The sliding-window pattern allows NA's receptive field to grow without needing extra pixel shifts, and preserves translational equivariance, unlike Swin Transformer's Window Self Attention (WSA). We develop NATTEN (Neighborhood Attention Extension), a Python package with efficient C++ and CUDA kernels, which allows NA to run up to 40% faster than Swin's WSA while using up to 25% less memory. We further present Neighborhood Attention Transformer (NAT), a new hierarchical transformer design based on NA that boosts image classification and downstream vision performance. Experimental results on NAT are competitive; NAT-Tiny reaches 83.2% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, 51.4% mAP on MS-COCO and 48.4% mIoU on ADE20K, which is 1.9% ImageNet accuracy, 1.0% COCO mAP, and 2.6% ADE20K mIoU improvement over a Swin model with similar size.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Linear Attention\"*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Maximizing Communication Efficiency for Large-scale Training via 0/1 Adam\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Christopher De Sa, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yucheng Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** 1-bit gradient compression and local steps are two representative techniques that enable drastic communication reduction in distributed SGD. Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT). In this paper, we demonstrate the non-linearity in Adam causes slow convergence even when 1-bit compression or local steps are individually applied. To alleviate this limitation, we propose 0/1 Adam that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. 0/1 Adam performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for 0/1 Adam on smooth non-convex objectives. On various large-scale benchmarks such as BERT-Base, BERT-Large, GPT-2 pre-training and ImageNet, we demonstrate on up to 128 GPUs that 0/1 Adam is able to reduce up to 87% of data volume, 54% of communication rounds, and achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher training throughput and end-to-end training time reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline 1-bit Adam; while enjoying the same statistical convergence speed and end task model accuracy on GLUE dataset and ImageNet validation set.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: \"Adaptive State Compression\"*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

For instance, the **HiTime** model described in and uses a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data, which is similar in intent to the hierarchical multi-scale processing proposed in **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**. However, **HiTime** is focused on time series classification and does not involve language models directly.\n- The use of temporal latent bottlenecks and adaptive state compression mechanisms needs to be compared with existing work. For example, mechanisms like those in **HiTime** (though not specifically for LMs) suggest that hierarchical and multi-scale processing can be effective, but the specific application to LMs like FastTTTLinear needs further investigation.\n\n## Overlap with Prior Designs\n\n- The proposal needs to be compared with sibling designs such as **compressivehierarchicalttt** and **sparsekeyfasttttlinear**. While the sources provided do not directly mention these specific designs, the general principles of hierarchical processing and adaptive compression can be found in other contexts. For instance, the Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) in object detection, as described in, shows how multi-scale features can be effectively combined, which might offer insights into how to implement similar concepts in LMs.\n\n## Impact on Accuracy, Robustness, Efficiency, and Scalability\n\n- **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Processing**: This could potentially improve the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies, similar to how FPN improves object detection by handling different scales effectively.\n- **Temporal Latent Bottlenecks**: Mechanisms like these could enhance memory management for long sequences, which is crucial for LMs dealing with extensive context windows.\n- **Adaptive State Compression**: This could optimize memory usage and improve computational efficiency, but it may introduce complexity and require careful tuning to ensure stability and efficiency.\n\n## Feasibility and Theoretical Soundness\n\n- The integration of hierarchical processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression needs to be theoretically sound and practically implementable. The **HiTime** model's use of a hierarchical feature encoder and dual-view contrastive alignment module suggests that such complex architectures can be theoretically sound and effective, but the specific application to FastTTTLinear requires careful analysis.\n\n## Clarity and Completeness of the Proposal\n\n- The proposal should clearly explain the design, including all aspects of the modifications. Any potential ambiguities or missing details need to be identified and addressed. For example, the detailed architecture and training process of **HiTime** provide a clear model for how such complex architectures can be described and implemented.\n\n### Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Models like **HiTime** demonstrate the effectiveness of hierarchical feature encoders in capturing diverse aspects of data. This concept can be adapted to language models to improve their handling of hierarchical relationships and long-range dependencies.\n- **Temporal Latent Bottlenecks and Adaptive State Compression**: These mechanisms are crucial for efficient memory management and could be inspired by similar concepts in other domains, such as the use of RoI pooling in Faster R-CNN to handle variable-sized inputs efficiently.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\n- **Gather Specific References**: Focus on papers that discuss hierarchical multi-scale processing, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression in the context of language models.

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 42/46 (Score: 0.46)*\n\n```\n[N/A]\n(b) Did you describe any potential participant risks, with links to Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, if applicable?

This work takes inspiration from a wide array of work on introducing multiple scales of processing into recurrent neural networks (Chung et al. 2016; Hihi \\& Bengio, 1995; Mozer, 1991, Schmidhuber, 1991, Koutn\u00edk et al., 2014). These works divide the processing into multiple streams each operating at a different temporal granularity. While these works mainly focus on recurrent neural networks and their application is mainly on natural language tasks, we focus on introducing multiple streams of processing and a hierarchical structure into Transformers while also focusing on a broader range of domains beyond natural language. Transformers. Some of the components we describe in the proposed model have been used previously in various Transformer models. Transformer XL (Dai et al., 2019) also divides the input into segments. Each segment considers the tokens from the current segment and the previous segment for attention without passing gradients into the previous segments. A number of previous works (Zhang et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021b, Wu et al., 2021, Yuan et al., 2021, Wang et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021) have worked on introducing a hierarchical structure in Transformers mainly in the domain of vision. The main goal of these works has been to introduce convolution-like hierarchies into Vision Transformers (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020). While these works progressively reduce the spatial resolution of the inputs in order to introduce hierarchies, we introduce hierarchies by adding another slow stream of information processing and without reducing the spatial resolution of the inputs. We also provision for the higher level of the hierarchy (i.e. the slow stream) to provide information to the lower levels as top-down conditioning which is not possible in any of the previous works. Top-Down Conditioning. Top-down information is information propagated from higher to lower levels of the network. It represents the models beliefs of the world and provides context for interpreting perceptual information.\n```\n\n#### 2. Learning to (Learn at Test Time): RNNs with Expressive Hidden States (Avg.

We propose TTT layers, a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is self-supervised learning. Our perspective that the forward pass of a layer contains a training loop itself opens up a new direction for future research. 2. TTT-Linear, one simple instantiation of TTT layers, outperforms Transformers and Mamba in our evaluations ranging from 125 M to 1.3 B parameters. 3. We improve the hardware efficiency of TTT layers through mini-batch TTT and the dual form, making TTT-Linear already a practical building block for LLMs. ## 2 Method\n\nAll sequence modeling layers can be viewed from the perspective of storing historic context into a hidden state, as shown in Figure $4 .{ }^{1}$ For example, RNN layers - such as LSTM [33], RWKV [56] and Mamba [26] layers - compress context into a state of fixed size across time.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/51 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nThis result represents an awkward reality for existing RNNs. On one hand, the main advantage of RNNs (vs. Transformers) is their linear (vs. quadratic) complexity. This asymptotic advantage is only realized in practice for long context, which according to Figure 3 is after 8 k . On the other hand, once context is long enough, existing RNNs such as Mamba struggle to actually take advantage of the extra information being conditioned on. The difficulty with long context is inherent to the very nature of RNN layers: Unlike self-attention, RNN layers have to compress context into a hidden state of fixed size. As a compression heuristic,\nthe update rule needs to discover the underlying structures and relationships among thousands or potentially millions of tokens. In this paper, we begin with the observation that self-supervised learning can compress a massive training set into the weights of a model such as an LLM, which often exhibits deep understanding about the semantic connections among its training data - exactly what we need from a compression heuristic. TTT layers. Motivated by this observation, we design a new class of sequence modeling layers where the hidden state is a model, and the update rule is a step of self-supervised learning. Because the process of updating the hidden state on a test sequence is equivalent to training a model at test time, this new class of layers is called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We introduce two simple instantiations within this class: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, where the hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP, respectively. TTT layers can be integrated into any network architecture and optimized end-to-end, similar to RNNs layers and self-attention. Wall-clock time. While the TTT layer is already efficient in FLOPs, we propose two practical innovations to make it efficient in wall-clock time. First, similar to the standard practice of taking gradient steps on mini-batches of sequences during regular training for better parallelism, we use mini-batches of tokens during TTT. Second, we develop a dual form for operations inside each TTT mini-batch, to better take advantage of modern GPUs and TPUs. The dual form is equivalent in output to the naive implementation, but trains more than $5 \\times$ faster. As shown in Figure 3, TTT-Linear is faster than Transformer at 8 k context and matches Mamba. Evaluations and open problems. While we have highlighted some results for TTT-Linear at the beginning of the paper, Section 3 presents more comprehensive evaluations for both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, and open problems exposed by our evaluations. For example, our evaluations following the Chinchilla recipe [34] do not cleanly fit a linear scaling trend even for the Transformer baseline.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/51 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nExisting RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state.

The cleanest way to integrate any RNN layer into a larger architecture would be to directly replace self-attention in a Transformer, known in this context as a backbone. However, existing RNNs such as Mamba [26] and Griffin [18] all use a different backbone from Transformers. Most notably, their backbone contains temporal convolutions before the RNN layers, which might help collect local information across time. After experimenting with the Mamba backbone, we find that it also improves perplexity for TTT layers, so we incorporate it into our proposed method. See Figure 16 (in Appendix) for details. ## 3 Experiments\n\nWe evaluate TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP by comparing with two baselines - Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Our main codebase is based on EasyLM [25], an open-source project for training and serving LLMs in JAX.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 18 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: \"Compressive Hierarchical Transformers\", \"FastTTTLinear Modifications\", \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Manning*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated.\n\n**Abstract:** For humans, language production and comprehension is sensitive to the hierarchical structure of sentences. In natural language processing, past work has questioned how effectively neural sequence models like transformers capture this hierarchical structure when generalizing to structurally novel inputs. We show that transformer language models can learn to generalize hierarchically after training for extremely long periods\u2014far beyond the point when in-domain accuracy has saturated. We call this phenomenon structural grokking. On multiple datasets, structural grokking exhibits inverted U-shaped scaling in model depth: intermediate-depth models generalize better than both very deep and very shallow transformers. When analyzing the relationship between model-internal properties and grokking, we find that optimal depth for grokking can be identified using the tree-structuredness metric of CITATION.

This study explores this brittleness of safety alignment by leveraging pruning and low-rank modifications. We develop methods to identify critical regions that are vital for safety guardrails, and that are disentangled from utility-relevant regions at both the neuron and rank levels. Surprisingly, the isolated regions we find are sparse, comprising about $3\\%$ at the parameter level and $2.5\\%$ at the rank level. Removing these regions compromises safety without significantly impacting utility, corroborating the inherent brittleness of the model's safety mechanisms. Moreover, we show that LLMs remain vulnerable to low-cost fine-tuning attacks even when modifications to the safety-critical regions are restricted.

We begin by observing that VAEs can actually implement autoregressive models, and other, more efficient generative models, if made sufficiently deep. Despite this, autoregressive models have traditionally outperformed VAEs. We test if insufficient depth explains the performance gap by by scaling a VAE to greater stochastic depth than previously explored and evaluating it on CIFAR-10, ImageNet, and FFHQ. We find that, in comparison to the PixelCNN, these very deep VAEs achieve higher likelihoods, use fewer parameters, generate samples thousands of times faster, and are more easily applied to high-resolution images.

Joint Autoregressive and Hierarchical Priors for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*David C. Minnen, J. Ball\u00e9, G. Toderici*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent models for learned image compression are based on autoencoders that learn approximately invertible mappings from pixels to a quantized latent representation. The transforms are combined with an entropy model, which is a prior on the latent representation that can be used with standard arithmetic coding algorithms to generate a compressed bitstream. Recently, hierarchical entropy models were introduced as a way to exploit more structure in the latents than previous fully factorized priors, improving compression performance while maintaining end-to-end optimization. Inspired by the success of autoregressive priors in probabilistic generative models, we examine autoregressive, hierarchical, and combined priors as alternatives, weighing their costs and benefits in the context of image compression. While it is well known that autoregressive models can incur a significant computational penalty, we find that in terms of compression performance, autoregressive and hierarchical priors are complementary and can be combined to exploit the probabilistic structure in the latents better than all previous learned models.

Learning to Summarize Long Texts with Memory Compression and Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: \"Compressive Hierarchical Transformers\"*\n\n*Jaehong Park, Jonathan Pilault, Christopher Pal*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mem2Mem, a memory-to-memory mechanism for hierarchical recurrent\nneural network based encoder decoder architectures and we explore its use for\nabstractive document summarization. Mem2Mem transfers \"memories\" via\nreadable/writable external memory modules that augment both the encoder and\ndecoder. Our memory regularization compresses an encoded input article into a\nmore compact set of sentence representations. Most importantly, the memory\ncompression step performs implicit extraction without labels, sidestepping\nissues with suboptimal ground-truth data and exposure bias of hybrid\nextractive-abstractive summarization techniques. By allowing the decoder to\nread/write over the encoded input memory, the model learns to read salient\ninformation about the input article while keeping track of what has been\ngenerated. Our Mem2Mem approach yields results that are competitive with state\nof the art transformer based summarization methods, but with 16 times fewer\nparameters\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-21T21:45:44Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Learning Syntax Without Planting Trees: Understanding When and Why\n  Transformers Generalize Hierarchically\n\n*From Search Query: \"Compressive Hierarchical Transformers\"*\n\n*Kabir Ahuja, Vidhisha Balachandran, Madhur Panwar, Tianxing He, Noah A. Smith, Navin Goyal, Yulia Tsvetkov*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers trained on natural language data have been shown to learn its\nhierarchical structure and generalize to sentences with unseen syntactic\nstructures without explicitly encoding any structural bias. In this work, we\ninvestigate sources of inductive bias in transformer models and their training\nthat could cause such generalization behavior to emerge. We extensively\nexperiment with transformer models trained on multiple synthetic datasets and\nwith different training objectives and show that while other objectives e.g.\nsequence-to-sequence modeling, prefix language modeling, often failed to lead\nto hierarchical generalization, models trained with the language modeling\nobjective consistently learned to generalize hierarchically. We then conduct\npruning experiments to study how transformers trained with the language\nmodeling objective encode hierarchical structure. When pruned, we find joint\nexistence of subnetworks within the model with different generalization\nbehaviors (subnetworks corresponding to hierarchical structure and linear\norder). Finally, we take a Bayesian perspective to further uncover\ntransformers' preference for hierarchical generalization: We establish a\ncorrelation between whether transformers generalize hierarchically on a dataset\nand whether the simplest explanation of that dataset is provided by a\nhierarchical grammar compared to regular grammars exhibiting linear\ngeneralization.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-25T07:10:29Z  (*Updated: 2024-05-31T23:47:15Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Softmax Attention with Constant Cost per Token\n\n*From Search Query: \"FastTTTLinear Modifications\"*\n\n*Franz A.

Our modification linearizes attention with\nexponential kernel feature maps, whose corresponding feature function is\ninfinite dimensional. We show that our modification is expressible as a\ncomposition of log-sums of exponentials, with a latent space of constant size,\nenabling application with constant time and space complexity per token. We\nimplement our modification, verify that it works in practice, and conclude that\nit is a promising alternative to conventional attention.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-08T20:14:10Z  (*Updated: 2024-04-27T19:03:14Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5. Shared Latent Space by Both Languages in Non-Autoregressive Neural\n  Machine Translation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*DongNyeong Heo, Heeyoul Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Non-autoregressive neural machine translation (NAT) offers substantial\ntranslation speed up compared to autoregressive neural machine translation (AT)\nat the cost of translation quality. Latent variable modeling has emerged as a\npromising approach to bridge this quality gap, particularly for addressing the\nchronic multimodality problem in NAT. In the previous works that used latent\nvariable modeling, they added an auxiliary model to estimate the posterior\ndistribution of the latent variable conditioned on the source and target\nsentences. However, it causes several disadvantages, such as redundant\ninformation extraction in the latent variable, increasing the number of\nparameters, and a tendency to ignore some information from the inputs. In this\npaper, we propose a novel latent variable modeling that integrates a dual\nreconstruction perspective and an advanced hierarchical latent modeling with a\nshared intermediate latent space across languages. This latent variable\nmodeling hypothetically alleviates or prevents the above disadvantages. In our\nexperiment results, we present comprehensive demonstrations that our proposed\napproach infers superior latent variables which lead better translation\nquality. Finally, in the benchmark translation tasks, such as WMT, we\ndemonstrate that our proposed method significantly improves translation quality\ncompared to previous NAT baselines including the state-of-the-art NAT model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-02T15:33:09Z  (*Updated: 2024-09-09T01:44:27Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. FastTrees: Parallel Latent Tree-Induction for Faster Sequence Encoding\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*Bill Tuck Weng Pung, Alvin Chan*\n\n**Abstract:** Inducing latent tree structures from sequential data is an emerging trend in\nthe NLP research landscape today, largely popularized by recent methods such as\nGumbel LSTM and Ordered Neurons (ON-LSTM). This paper proposes FASTTREES, a new\ngeneral purpose neural module for fast sequence encoding. Unlike most previous\nworks that consider recurrence to be necessary for tree induction, our work\nexplores the notion of parallel tree induction, i.e., imbuing our model with\nhierarchical inductive biases in a parallelizable, non-autoregressive fashion.\nTo this end, our proposed FASTTREES achieves competitive or superior\nperformance to ON-LSTM on four well-established sequence modeling tasks, i.e.,\nlanguage modeling, logical inference, sentiment analysis and natural language\ninference. Moreover, we show that the FASTTREES module can be applied to\nenhance Transformer models, achieving performance gains on three sequence\ntransduction tasks (machine translation, subject-verb agreement and\nmathematical language understanding), paving the way for modular tree induction\nmodules. Overall, we outperform existing state-of-the-art models on logical\ninference tasks by +4% and mathematical language understanding by +8%.\n\n**Published:** 2021-11-28T03:08:06Z  (*Updated: 2021-11-28T03:08:06Z*)\n\n\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer for Snapshot Compressive Imaging\n\n*From Search Query: \"Compressive Hierarchical Transformers\"*\n\n*Xin Yuan, Lishun Wang, Yulun Zhang, Ping Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved the state-of-the-art performance on solving the inverse problem of Snapshot Compressive Imaging (SCI) for video, whose ill-posedness is rooted in the mixed degradation of spatial masking and temporal aliasing. However, previous Transformers lack an insight into the degradation and thus have limited performance and efficiency. In this work, we tailor an efficient reconstruction architecture without temporal aggregation in early layers and Hierarchical Separable Video Transformer (HiSViT) as building block. HiSViT is built by multiple groups of Cross-Scale Separable Multi-head Self-Attention (CSS-MSA) and Gated Self-Modulated Feed-Forward Network (GSM-FFN) with dense connections, each of which is conducted within a separate channel portions at a different scale, for multi-scale interactions and long-range modeling. By separating spatial operations from temporal ones, CSS-MSA introduces an inductive bias of paying more attention within frames instead of between frames while saving computational overheads. GSM-FFN further enhances the locality via gated mechanism and factorized spatial-temporal convolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms previous methods by $\\!>\\!0.5$ dB with comparable or fewer parameters and complexity.

HST: Hierarchical Swin Transformer for Compressed Image Super-resolution\n\n*From Search Query: \"Compressive Hierarchical Transformers\"*\n\n*Zhibo Chen, Ruoyu Feng, Sen Liu, Yiting Lu, Xin Li, Bingchen Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Compressed Image Super-resolution has achieved great attention in recent years, where images are degraded with compression artifacts and low-resolution artifacts. Since the complex hybrid distortions, it is hard to restore the distorted image with the simple cooperation of super-resolution and compression artifacts removing. In this paper, we take a step forward to propose the Hierarchical Swin Transformer (HST) network to restore the low-resolution compressed image, which jointly captures the hierarchical feature representations and enhances each-scale representation with Swin transformer, respectively. Moreover, we find that the pretraining with Super-resolution (SR) task is vital in compressed image super-resolution. To explore the effects of different SR pretraining, we take the commonly-used SR tasks (e.g., bicubic and different real super-resolution simulations) as our pretraining tasks, and reveal that SR plays an irreplaceable role in the compressed image super-resolution. With the cooperation of HST and pre-training, our HST achieves the fifth place in AIM 2022 challenge on the low-quality compressed image super-resolution track, with the PSNR of 23.51dB. Extensive experiments and ablation studies have validated the effectiveness of our proposed methods.

Hierarchical Prosody Modeling for Non-Autoregressive Speech Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*Hung-Yi Lee, Chung-Ming Chien*\n\n**Abstract:** Prosody modeling is an essential component in modern text-to-speech (TTS) frameworks. By explicitly providing prosody features to the TTS model, the style of synthesized utterances can thus be controlled. However, predicting natural and reasonable prosody at inference time is challenging. In this work, we analyzed the behavior of non-autoregressive TTS models under different prosody-modeling settings and proposed a hierarchical architecture, in which the prediction of phoneme-level prosody features are conditioned on the word-level prosody features. The proposed method outperforms other competitors in terms of audio quality and prosody naturalness in our objective and subjective evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. End-to-End Modeling Hierarchical Time Series Using Autoregressive Transformer and Conditional Normalizing Flow based Reconciliation\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hierarchical Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*Yun Hu, Lei Lei, Bo Zheng, Yangfei Zheng, James Zhang, Lintao Ma, Yinbo Sun, Fan Zhou, Shiyu Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multivariate time series forecasting with hierarchical structure is pervasive in real-world applications, demanding not only predicting each level of the hierarchy, but also reconciling all forecasts to ensure coherency, i.e., the forecasts should satisfy the hierarchical aggregation constraints. Moreover, the disparities of statistical characteristics between levels can be huge, worsened by non-Gaussian distributions and non-linear correlations. To this extent, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical time series forecasting model, based on conditioned normalizing flow-based autoregressive transformer reconciliation, to represent complex data distribution while simultaneously reconciling the forecasts to ensure coherency. Unlike other state-of-the-art methods, we achieve the forecasting and reconciliation simultaneously without requiring any explicit post-processing step. In addition, by harnessing the power of deep model, we do not rely on any assumption such as unbiased estimates or Gaussian distribution. Our evaluation experiments are conducted on four real-world hierarchical datasets from different industrial domains (three public ones and a dataset from the application servers of Alipay's data center) and the preliminary results demonstrate efficacy of our proposed method.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as the proposed **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**, that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, here are the key insights and useful information extracted from the analysis and search results:\n\n## Hierarchical Multi-Scale Processing\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-established and has been successfully implemented in models like **H-Transformer-1D** and **Hi-Transformer**.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.75)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.47)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.31)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.33)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/51 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\n## Summary of contributions. 1.

An Efficient Asynchronous Method for Integrating Evolutionary and Gradient-based Policy Search\n\n*From Search Query: \"Novel Integration in FastTTTLinear\"*\n\n*Kyunghyun Lee, Byeong-uk Lee, Ukcheol Shin, In-So Kweon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces an Asynchronous Evolution Strategy-Reinforcement Learning (AES-RL) that maximizes the parallel efficiency of ES and integrates it with policy gradient methods, and proposes various asynchronous update methods that can take all advantages of asynchronism, ES, and DRL.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms and evolution strategies (ES) have been applied to various tasks, showing excellent performances. These have the opposite properties, with DRL having good sample efficiency and poor stability, while ES being vice versa. Recently, there have been attempts to combine these algorithms, but these methods fully rely on synchronous update scheme, making it not ideal to maximize the benefits of the parallelism in ES. To solve this challenge, asynchronous update scheme was introduced, which is capable of good time-efficiency and diverse policy exploration. In this paper, we introduce an Asynchronous Evolution Strategy-Reinforcement Learning (AES-RL) that maximizes the parallel efficiency of ES and integrates it with policy gradient methods. Specifically, we propose 1) a novel framework to merge ES and DRL asynchronously and 2) various asynchronous update methods that can take all advantages of asynchronism, ES, and DRL, which are exploration and time efficiency, stability, and sample efficiency, respectively. The proposed framework and update methods are evaluated in continuous control benchmark work, showing superior performance as well as time efficiency compared to the previous methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. OmniQuant: Omnidirectionally Calibrated Quantization for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Memory Management in Language Models\"*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Mengzhao Chen, Zhaoyang Zhang, Peng Xu, Lirui Zhao, Zhiqiang Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Peng Gao, Y. Qiao, Ping Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** An Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization technique for LLMs is introduced, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized natural language processing tasks. However, their practical deployment is hindered by their immense memory and computation requirements. Although recent post-training quantization (PTQ) methods are effective in reducing memory footprint and improving the computational efficiency of LLM, they hand-craft quantization parameters, leading to low performance, especially in extremely low-bit quantization. To tackle this issue, we introduce an Omnidirectionally calibrated Quantization (\\textbf{OmniQuant}) technique for LLMs, which achieves good performance in diverse quantization settings while maintaining the computational efficiency of PTQ by efficiently optimizing various quantization parameters. OmniQuant comprises two innovative components including Learnable Weight Clipping (LWC) and Learnable Equivalent Transformation (LET). LWC modulates the extreme values of weights by optimizing the clipping threshold. Meanwhile, LET tackles activation outliers by shifting the challenge of quantization from activations to weights. Operating within a differentiable framework using block-wise error minimization, OmniQuant can optimize the quantization process efficiently for both weight-only and weight-activation quantization. For instance, the LLaMA-2 model family size 7-70B can be processed with OmniQuant on a single A100-40G GPU within 1-16 hours using 128 samples. Extensive experiments validate OmniQuant's superior performance across diverse quantization configurations such as W4A4 (4-bit weight, 4-bit activation), W6A6, W4A16, W3A16, and W2A16. Additionally, OmniQuant demonstrates effectiveness in instruction-tuned models and delivers notable improvements in inference speed and memory reduction on real devices.

BPipe: Memory-Balanced Pipeline Parallelism for Training Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Memory Management in Language Models\"*\n\n*Taebum Kim, Hyoungjoon Kim, Gyeong-In Yu, Byung-Gon Chun*\n\n**TL;DR:** BP IPE employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between GPUs during training, enabling all GPUs to utilize comparable amounts of memory, and enhances the training ef\ufb01ciency of large language models like GPT-3 by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size.\n\n**Abstract:** Pipeline parallelism is a key technique for training large language models within GPU clusters. However, it often leads to a memory imbalance problem, where certain GPUs face high memory pressure while others underutilize their capacity. This imbalance results in suboptimal training performance, even when the overall GPU memory capacity is suf\ufb01cient for more ef\ufb01cient setups. To address this inef\ufb01ciency, we propose BP IPE , a novel approach for achieving memory balance in pipeline parallelism. BP IPE employs an activation balancing method to transfer intermediate activations between GPUs during training, enabling all GPUs to utilize comparable amounts of memory. With balanced memory utilization, BP IPE enhances the training ef\ufb01ciency of large language models like GPT-3 by eliminating redundant recomputations or increasing the micro-batch size. Our evaluation conducted on 48 A100 GPUs across six nodes interconnected with HDR In\ufb01niBand shows that BP IPE accelerates the training of GPT-3 96B and GPT-3 134B models by 1.25x-2.17x compared to Megatron-LM, a state-of-the-art framework for training large language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4.

Wong, Longyue Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy that enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) predominantly employ decoder-only transformer architectures, necessitating the retention of keys/values information for historical tokens to provide contextual information and avoid redundant computation. However, the substantial size and parameter volume of these LLMs require massive GPU memory. This memory demand increases with the length of the input text, leading to an urgent need for more efficient methods of information storage and processing. This study introduces Anchor-based LLMs (AnLLMs), which utilize an innovative anchor-based self-attention network (AnSAN) and also an anchor-based inference strategy. This approach enables LLMs to compress sequence information into an anchor token, reducing the keys/values cache and enhancing inference efficiency. Experiments on question-answering benchmarks reveal that AnLLMs maintain similar accuracy levels while achieving up to 99% keys/values cache reduction and up to 3.5 times faster inference. Despite a minor compromise in accuracy, the substantial enhancements of AnLLMs employing the AnSAN technique in resource utilization and computational efficiency underscore their potential for practical LLM applications.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. M3ViT: Mixture-of-Experts Vision Transformer for Efficient Multi-task Learning with Model-Accelerator Co-design\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hardware-Efficient FastTTTLinear Innovations\"*\n\n*Hanxue Liang, Zhiwen Fan, Rishov Sarkar, Ziyu Jiang, Tianlong Chen, Kai Zou, Yu Cheng, Cong Hao, Zhangyang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL that customizes mixture-of-experts layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training, and is enhanced by hardware-level innovations.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-task learning (MTL) encapsulates multiple learned tasks in a single model and often lets those tasks learn better jointly. However, when deploying MTL onto those real-world systems that are often resource-constrained or latency-sensitive, two prominent challenges arise: (i) during training, simultaneously optimizing all tasks is often difficult due to gradient conflicts across tasks; (ii) at inference, current MTL regimes have to activate nearly the entire model even to just execute a single task. Yet most real systems demand only one or two tasks at each moment, and switch between tasks as needed: therefore such all tasks activated inference is also highly inefficient and non-scalable. In this paper, we present a model-accelerator co-design framework to enable efficient on-device MTL. Our framework, dubbed M$^3$ViT, customizes mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers into a vision transformer (ViT) backbone for MTL, and sparsely activates task-specific experts during training. Then at inference with any task of interest, the same design allows for activating only the task-corresponding sparse expert pathway, instead of the full model. Our new model design is further enhanced by hardware-level innovations, in particular, a novel computation reordering scheme tailored for memory-constrained MTL that achieves zero-overhead switching between tasks and can scale to any number of experts. When executing single-task inference, M$^{3}$ViT achieves higher accuracies than encoder-focused MTL methods, while significantly reducing 88% inference FLOPs. When implemented on a hardware platform of one Xilinx ZCU104 FPGA, our co-design framework reduces the memory requirement by 2.4 times, while achieving energy efficiency up to 9.23 times higher than a comparable FPGA baseline.

This paper focuses on task-agnostic distillation. It produces a compact pre-trained model that can be easily fine-tuned on various tasks with small computational costs and memory footprints. Despite the practical benefits, task-agnostic distillation is challenging. Since the teacher model has a significantly larger capacity and stronger representation power than the student model, it is very difficult for the student to produce predictions that match the teacher's over a massive amount of open-domain training data. Such a large prediction discrepancy often diminishes the benefits of knowledge distillation. To address this challenge, we propose Homotopic Distillation (HomoDistil), a novel task-agnostic distillation approach equipped with iterative pruning. Specifically, we initialize the student model from the teacher model, and iteratively prune the student's neurons until the target width is reached. Such an approach maintains a small discrepancy between the teacher's and student's predictions throughout the distillation process, which ensures the effectiveness of knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HomoDistil achieves significant improvements on existing baselines.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: \"Novel Memory Compression Techniques in Transformers\"*\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 9.

Tuning Language Models as Training Data Generators for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"Enhanced Learning Mechanisms in Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*Yu Meng, Martin Michalski, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, T. Abdelzaher, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work first tunes an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then uses it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set, achieving an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few- shot learning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 11.

This paper explores a novel PLM reuse paradigm,\nKnowledge Integration (KI). Without human annotations available, KI aims to\nmerge the knowledge from different teacher-PLMs, each of which specializes in a\ndifferent classification problem, into a versatile student model. To achieve\nthis, we first derive the correlation between virtual golden supervision and\nteacher predictions. We then design a Model Uncertainty--aware Knowledge\nIntegration (MUKI) framework to recover the golden supervision for the student.\nSpecifically, MUKI adopts Monte-Carlo Dropout to estimate model uncertainty for\nthe supervision integration. An instance-wise re-weighting mechanism based on\nthe margin of uncertainty scores is further incorporated, to deal with the\npotential conflicting supervision from teachers. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that MUKI achieves substantial improvements over baselines on\nbenchmark datasets. Further analysis shows that MUKI can generalize well for\nmerging teacher models with heterogeneous architectures, and even teachers\nmajor in cross-lingual datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-11T07:59:08Z  (*Updated: 2022-10-11T07:59:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Modular Transformers: Compressing Transformers into Modularized Layers\n  for Flexible Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: \"Advanced Hierarchical Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Wangchunshu Zhou, Ronan Le Bras, Yejin Choi*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained Transformer models like T5 and BART have advanced the state of\nthe art on a wide range of text generation tasks. Compressing these models into\nsmaller ones has become critically important for practical use. Common neural\nnetwork compression techniques such as knowledge distillation or quantization\nare limited to static compression where the compression ratio is fixed. In this\npaper, we introduce Modular Transformers, a modularized encoder-decoder\nframework for flexible sequence-to-sequence model compression. Modular\nTransformers train modularized layers that have the same function of two or\nmore consecutive layers in the original model via module replacing and\nknowledge distillation. After training, the modularized layers can be flexibly\nassembled into sequence-to-sequence models that meet different\nperformance-efficiency trade-offs. Experimental results show that after a\nsingle training phase, by simply varying the assembling strategy, Modular\nTransformers can achieve flexible compression ratios from 1.1x to 6x with\nlittle to moderate relative performance drop.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z  (*Updated: 2023-06-04T15:26:28Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4.

UIO-LLMs: Unbiased Incremental Optimization for Long-Context LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Memory Management in Language Models\"*\n\n*Wenhao Li, Mingbao Lin, Yunshan Zhong, Shuicheng Yan, Rongrong Ji*\n\n**Abstract:** Managing long texts is challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to\nlimited context window sizes. This study introduces UIO-LLMs, an unbiased\nincremental optimization approach for memory-enhanced transformers under\nlong-context settings. We initially conceptualize the process as a streamlined\nencoder-decoder framework where the weights-shared encoder and decoder\nrespectively encapsulate a context segment into memories and leverage these\nmemories to predict outputs of the subsequent segment. Subsequently, by\ntreating our memory-enhanced transformers as fully-connected recurrent neural\nnetworks (RNNs), we refine the training process using the Truncated\nBackpropagation Through Time (TBPTT) algorithm, which incorporates innovative\nincremental optimization techniques. These techniques not only diminish time\ncomplexity but also address the bias in gradient computation through an\nunbiased optimization process. UIO-LLMs successfully handle long context, such\nas extending the context window of Llama2-7b-chat from 4K to 100K tokens with\nminimal 2% additional parameters, while keeping the inference cost nearly\nlinear as context length increases.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-26T08:44:36Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-26T08:44:36Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 6. EdgeMoE: Fast On-Device Inference of MoE-based Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: \"Innovative Memory Management in Language Models\"*\n\n*Rongjie Yi, Liwei Guo, Shiyun Wei, Ao Zhou, Shangguang Wang, Mengwei Xu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPTs and LLaMa have ushered in a\nrevolution in machine intelligence, owing to their exceptional capabilities in\na wide range of machine learning tasks. However, the transition of LLMs from\ndata centers to edge devices presents a set of challenges and opportunities.\nWhile this shift can enhance privacy and availability, it is hampered by the\nenormous parameter sizes of these models, leading to impractical runtime costs.\nIn light of these considerations, we introduce EdgeMoE, the first on-device\ninference engine tailored for mixture-of-expert (MoE) LLMs, a popular variant\nof sparse LLMs that exhibit nearly constant computational complexity as their\nparameter size scales. EdgeMoE achieves both memory and computational\nefficiency by strategically partitioning the model across the storage\nhierarchy. Specifically, non-expert weights are stored in the device's memory,\nwhile expert weights are kept in external storage and are fetched into memory\nonly when they are activated. This design is underpinned by a crucial insight\nthat expert weights, though voluminous, are infrequently accessed due to sparse\nactivation patterns. To further mitigate the overhead associated with expert\nI/O swapping, EdgeMoE incorporates two innovative techniques: (1) Expert-wise\nbitwidth adaptation: This method reduces the size of expert weights with an\nacceptable level of accuracy loss. (2) Expert management: It predicts the\nexperts that will be activated in advance and preloads them into the\ncompute-I/O pipeline, thus further optimizing the process. In empirical\nevaluations conducted on well-established MoE LLMs and various edge devices,\nEdgeMoE demonstrates substantial memory savings and performance improvements\nwhen compared to competitive baseline solutions.\n\n**Published:** 2023-08-28T06:56:08Z  (*Updated: 2023-08-28T06:56:08Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 7.

CiwGAN and fiwGAN: Encoding information in acoustic data to model\n  lexical learning with Generative Adversarial Networks\n\n*From Search Query: \"Hardware-Efficient FastTTTLinear Innovations\"*\n\n*Ga\u0161per Begu\u0161*\n\n**Abstract:** How can deep neural networks encode information that corresponds to words in\nhuman speech into raw acoustic data? This paper proposes two neural network\narchitectures for modeling unsupervised lexical learning from raw acoustic\ninputs, ciwGAN (Categorical InfoWaveGAN) and fiwGAN (Featural InfoWaveGAN),\nthat combine a Deep Convolutional GAN architecture for audio data (WaveGAN;\narXiv:1705.07904) with an information theoretic extension of GAN -- InfoGAN\n(arXiv:1606.03657), and propose a new latent space structure that can model\nfeatural learning simultaneously with a higher level classification and allows\nfor a very low-dimension vector representation of lexical items. Lexical\nlearning is modeled as emergent from an architecture that forces a deep neural\nnetwork to output data such that unique information is retrievable from its\nacoustic outputs. The networks trained on lexical items from TIMIT learn to\nencode unique information corresponding to lexical items in the form of\ncategorical variables in their latent space. By manipulating these variables,\nthe network outputs specific lexical items. The network occasionally outputs\ninnovative lexical items that violate training data, but are linguistically\ninterpretable and highly informative for cognitive modeling and neural network\ninterpretability. Innovative outputs suggest that phonetic and phonological\nrepresentations learned by the network can be productively recombined and\ndirectly paralleled to productivity in human speech: a fiwGAN network trained\non `suit' and `dark' outputs innovative `start', even though it never saw\n`start' or even a [st] sequence in the training data. We also argue that\nsetting latent featural codes to values well beyond training range results in\nalmost categorical generation of prototypical lexical items and reveals\nunderlying values of each latent code.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-04T15:33:55Z  (*Updated: 2021-07-28T10:31:31Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 9. On Geodesic Distances and Contextual Embedding Compression for Text\n  Classification\n\n*From Search Query: \"Novel Memory Compression Techniques in Transformers\"*\n\n*Rishi Jha, Kai Mihata*\n\n**Abstract:** In some memory-constrained settings like IoT devices and over-the-network\ndata pipelines, it can be advantageous to have smaller contextual embeddings.\nWe investigate the efficacy of projecting contextual embedding data (BERT) onto\na manifold, and using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques to compress\nthese embeddings. In particular, we propose a novel post-processing approach,\napplying a combination of Isomap and PCA. We find that the geodesic distance\nestimations, estimates of the shortest path on a Riemannian manifold, from\nIsomap's k-Nearest Neighbors graph bolstered the performance of the compressed\nembeddings to be comparable to the original BERT embeddings. On one dataset, we\nfind that despite a 12-fold dimensionality reduction, the compressed embeddings\nperformed within 0.1% of the original BERT embeddings on a downstream\nclassification task. In addition, we find that this approach works particularly\nwell on tasks reliant on syntactic data, when compared with linear\ndimensionality reduction. These results show promise for a novel geometric\napproach to achieve lower dimensional text embeddings from existing\ntransformers and pave the way for data-specific and application-specific\nembedding compressions.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-22T19:30:06Z  (*Updated: 2021-04-22T19:30:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 10.

To reduce the size and complexity of\nthese models, we propose LoSparse (Low-Rank and Sparse approximation), a novel\nmodel compression technique that approximates a weight matrix by the sum of a\nlow-rank matrix and a sparse matrix. Our method combines the advantages of both\nlow-rank approximations and pruning, while avoiding their limitations. Low-rank\napproximation compresses the coherent and expressive parts in neurons, while\npruning removes the incoherent and non-expressive parts in neurons. Pruning\nenhances the diversity of low-rank approximations, and low-rank approximation\nprevents pruning from losing too many expressive neurons. We evaluate our\nmethod on natural language understanding, question answering, and natural\nlanguage generation tasks.

Sound reconstruction from human brain activity via a generative model with brain-like auditory features\n\n*From Search Query: \"Advanced Hierarchical Compression in Transformers\"*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** The successful reconstruction of perceptual experiences from human brain activity has provided insights into the neural representations of sensory experiences. However, reconstructing arbitrary sounds has been avoided due to the complexity of temporal sequences in sounds and the limited resolution of neuroimaging modalities. To overcome these challenges, leveraging the hierarchical nature of brain auditory processing could provide a path toward reconstructing arbitrary sounds. Previous studies have indicated a hierarchical homology between the human auditory system and deep neural network (DNN) models. Furthermore, advancements in audio-generative models enable to transform compressed representations back into high-resolution sounds. In this study, we introduce a novel sound reconstruction method that combines brain decoding of auditory features with an audio-generative model. Using fMRI responses to natural sounds, we found that the hierarchical sound features of a DNN model could be better decoded than spectrotemporal features. We then reconstructed the sound using an audio transformer that disentangled compressed temporal information in the decoded DNN features. Our method shows unconstrained sounds reconstruction capturing sound perceptual contents and quality and generalizability by reconstructing sound categories not included in the training dataset. Reconstructions from different auditory regions remain similar to actual sounds, highlighting the distributed nature of auditory representations. To see whether the reconstructions mirrored actual subjective perceptual experiences, we performed an experiment involving selective auditory attention to one of overlapping sounds. The results tended to resemble the attended sound than the unattended. These findings demonstrate that our proposed model provides a means to externalize experienced auditory contents from human brain activity.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-20\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Nonetheless, the potential of transformer-based diffusion models for effectively generating videos with controllable motion remains an area of limited exploration. This paper introduces Tora, the first trajectory-oriented DiT framework that concurrently integrates textual, visual, and trajectory conditions, thereby enabling scalable video generation with effective motion guidance. Specifically, Tora consists of a Trajectory Extractor(TE), a Spatial-Temporal DiT, and a Motion-guidance Fuser(MGF). The TE encodes arbitrary trajectories into hierarchical spacetime motion patches with a 3D video compression network. The MGF integrates the motion patches into the DiT blocks to generate consistent videos that accurately follow designated trajectories. Our design aligns seamlessly with DiT's scalability, allowing precise control of video content's dynamics with diverse durations, aspect ratios, and resolutions. Extensive experiments demonstrate Tora's excellence in achieving high motion fidelity, while also meticulously simulating the intricate movement of the physical world.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the performance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a single GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without sacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is information theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double quantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the quantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We use QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of instruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets, multiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to run with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results show that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to state-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous SoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human and GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable alternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot benchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of chatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to ChatGPT.

In this work, we introduce QuIP#, a weight-only PTQ method that achieves state-of-the-art results in extreme compression regimes ($\\le$ 4 bits per weight) using three novel techniques. First, QuIP# improves QuIP's (Chee et al., 2023) incoherence processing by using the randomized Hadamard transform, which is faster and has better theoretical properties. Second, QuIP# uses vector quantization to take advantage of the ball-shaped sub-Gaussian distribution that incoherent weights possess: specifically, we introduce a set of hardware-efficient codebooks based on the highly symmetric $E_8$ lattice, which achieves the optimal 8-dimension unit ball packing. Third, QuIP# uses fine-tuning to improve fidelity to the original model. Our experiments show that QuIP# outperforms existing PTQ methods, enables new behaviors in PTQ scaling, and supports fast inference.

In this work, we demonstrate that decoder-only transformers can in fact be conceptualized as unbounded multi-state RNNs - an RNN variant with unlimited hidden state size. We further show that transformers can be converted into $\\textit{bounded}$ multi-state RNNs by fixing the size of their hidden state, effectively compressing their key-value cache. We introduce a novel, training-free compression policy - $\\textbf{T}$oken $\\textbf{O}$mission $\\textbf{V}$ia $\\textbf{A}$ttention (TOVA). Our experiments with four long range tasks and several LLMs show that TOVA outperforms several baseline compression policies. Particularly, our results are nearly on par with the full model, using in some cases only $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the original cache size, which translates to 4.8X higher throughput. Our results shed light on the connection between transformers and RNNs, and help mitigate one of LLMs' most painful computational bottlenecks - the size of their key-value cache.

Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 8. LeftRefill: Filling Right Canvas based on Left Reference through Generalized Text-to-Image Diffusion Model\n\n*From Search Query: \"Enhanced Learning Mechanisms in Autoregressive Models\"*\n\n*Yikai Wang, Qiaole Dong, Yunuo Cai, Yanwei Fu, Chenjie Cao*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces LeftRefill, an innovative approach to efficiently harness large Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models for reference-guided image synthesis. As the name implies, LeftRefill horizontally stitches reference and target views together as a whole input. The reference image occupies the left side, while the target canvas is positioned on the right. Then, LeftRefill paints the right-side target canvas based on the left-side reference and specific task instructions. Such a task formulation shares some similarities with contextual inpainting, akin to the actions of a human painter. This novel formulation efficiently learns both structural and textured correspondence between reference and target without other image encoders or adapters. We inject task and view information through cross-attention modules in T2I models, and further exhibit multi-view reference ability via the re-arranged self-attention modules. These enable LeftRefill to perform consistent generation as a generalized model without requiring test-time fine-tuning or model modifications. Thus, LeftRefill can be seen as a simple yet unified framework to address reference-guided synthesis. As an exemplar, we leverage LeftRefill to address two different challenges: reference-guided inpainting and novel view synthesis, based on the pre-trained StableDiffusion. Codes and models are released at https://github.com/ewrfcas/LeftRefill.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2024-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to design a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically an enhancement of the **FastTTTLinear** model, that can outperform existing state-of-the-art models.

    "abstract": "PredictiveFastTTTLinear enhances FastTTTLinear by introducing a novel predictive memory management system that combines learned memory access patterns with hardware-aware tiling strategies. The design employs a dual-path architecture where one path predicts future memory access patterns while the other optimizes current computations through adaptive tiling. This approach significantly reduces memory latency and improves hardware utilization while maintaining model accuracy through careful coordination between predictive and computational paths.",
