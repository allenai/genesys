Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n#### 2. Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.82)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/35 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nFigure 3 also includes a baseline row factoring a matrix of appropriately scaled i.i.d. Gaussian entries, to indicate typical errors for factoring an unstructured matrix. ### 4.2 Neural Network Compression\n\nMany structured matrix approaches have been proposed to replace fully-connected (FC) layers of neural networks, to speed up training and inference, and to reduce the memory consumption. These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n#### 3. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.72)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/46 (Score: 0.72)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 5547-5569.

Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W. Thomas, Benjamin Spector, Michael Poli, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices is developed based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic, showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning models are increasingly being scaled in both sequence length and model dimension to reach longer contexts and better performance. However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 2. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Compute Better Spent: Replacing Dense Layers with Structured Matrices\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Shikai Qiu, Andres Potapczynski, Marc Finzi, Micah Goldblum, Andrew Gordon Wilson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices, and proposes a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which is shown to be better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Dense linear layers are the dominant computational bottleneck in foundation models. Identifying more efficient alternatives to dense matrices has enormous potential for building more compute-efficient models, as exemplified by the success of convolutional networks in the image domain. In this work, we systematically explore structured matrices as replacements for dense matrices. We show that different structures often require drastically different initialization scales and learning rates, which are crucial to performance, especially as models scale. Using insights from the Maximal Update Parameterization, we determine the optimal scaling for initialization and learning rates of these unconventional layers. Finally, we measure the scaling laws of different structures to compare how quickly their performance improves with compute. We propose a novel matrix family containing Monarch matrices, the Block Tensor-Train (BTT), which we show performs better than dense matrices for the same compute on multiple tasks. On CIFAR-10/100 with augmentation, BTT achieves exponentially lower training loss than dense when training MLPs and ViTs. BTT matches dense ViT-S/32 performance on ImageNet-1k with 3.8 times less compute and is more efficient than dense for training small GPT-2 language models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Guolin Ke, Qi Meng, Thomas Finley, Taifeng Wang, Wei Chen, Weidong Ma, Qiwei Ye, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: \\emph{Gradient-based One-Side Sampling} (GOSS) and \\emph{Exclusive Feature Bundling} (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB \\emph{LightGBM}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 8722  (*Influential: 936*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Gradient Computation for Structured Output Learning with Rational and Tropical Losses\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Corinna Cortes, Vitaly Kuznetsov, M. Mohri, Dmitry Storcheus, Scott Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Efficient gradient computation algorithms for two broad families of structured prediction loss functions: rational and tropical losses are designed that facilitate efficient gradient computation and enable one to train learning models such as neural networks with complex structured losses.\n\n**Abstract:** Many structured prediction problems admit a natural loss function for evaluation such as the edit-distance or $n$-gram loss. However, existing learning algorithms are typically designed to optimize alternative objectives such as the cross-entropy. This is because a na\\\"{i}ve implementation of the natural loss functions often results in intractable gradient computations. In this paper, we design efficient gradient computation algorithms for two broad families of structured prediction loss functions: rational and tropical losses. These families include as special cases the $n$-gram loss, the edit-distance loss, and many other loss functions commonly used in natural language processing and computational biology tasks that are based on sequence similarity measures. Our algorithms make use of weighted automata and graph operations over appropriate semirings to design efficient solutions. They facilitate efficient gradient computation and hence enable one to train learning models such as neural networks with complex structured losses.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. Dynamic Sparsity Is Channel-Level Sparsity Learner\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Lu Yin, Gen Li, Meng Fang, Lijuan Shen, Tianjin Huang, Zhangyang Wang, V. Menkovski, Xiaolong Ma, Mykola Pechenizkiy, Shiwei Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase) is proposed, which for the first time seamlessly translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly channel-level sparsity during one end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations.\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse training has received an upsurging interest in machine learning due to its tantalizing saving potential for the entire training process as well as inference. Dynamic sparse training (DST), as a leading sparse training approach, can train deep neural networks at high sparsity from scratch to match the performance of their dense counterparts. However, most if not all DST prior arts demonstrate their effectiveness on unstructured sparsity with highly irregular sparse patterns, which receives limited support in common hardware. This limitation hinders the usage of DST in practice. In this paper, we propose Channel-aware dynamic sparse (Chase), which for the first time seamlessly translates the promise of unstructured dynamic sparsity to GPU-friendly channel-level sparsity (not fine-grained N:M or group sparsity) during one end-to-end training process, without any ad-hoc operations. The resulting small sparse networks can be directly accelerated by commodity hardware, without using any particularly sparsity-aware hardware accelerators. This appealing outcome is partially motivated by a hidden phenomenon of dynamic sparsity: off-the-shelf unstructured DST implicitly involves biased parameter reallocation across channels, with a large fraction of channels (up to 60%) being sparser than others. By progressively identifying and removing these channels during training, our approach translates unstructured sparsity to channel-wise sparsity. Our experimental results demonstrate that Chase achieves 1.7 X inference throughput speedup on common GPU devices without compromising accuracy with ResNet-50 on ImageNet.

Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. Nonparametric Factor Trajectory Learning for Dynamic Tensor Decomposition\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Z. Wang, Shandian Zhe*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes NONparametric FActor Trajectory learning for dynamic tensor decomposition (NONFAT), which places Gaussian process (GP) priors in the frequency domain and conducts inverse Fourier transform via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to sample the trajectory functions.\n\n**Abstract:** Tensor decomposition is a fundamental framework to analyze data that can be represented by multi-dimensional arrays. In practice, tensor data is often accompanied by temporal information, namely the time points when the entry values were generated. This information implies abundant, complex temporal variation patterns. However, current methods always assume the factor representations of the entities in each tensor mode are static, and never consider their temporal evolution. To fill this gap, we propose NONparametric FActor Trajectory learning for dynamic tensor decomposition (NONFAT). We place Gaussian process (GP) priors in the frequency domain and conduct inverse Fourier transform via Gauss-Laguerre quadrature to sample the trajectory functions. In this way, we can overcome data sparsity and obtain robust trajectory estimates across long time horizons. Given the trajectory values at specific time points, we use a second-level GP to sample the entry values and to capture the temporal relationship between the entities. For efficient and scalable inference, we leverage the matrix Gaussian structure in the model, introduce a matrix Gaussian posterior, and develop a nested sparse variational learning algorithm. We have shown the advantage of our method in several real-world applications.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. BLAST: Block-Level Adaptive Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Network Inference\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Hun-Seok Kim, Qing Qu, Soo Min Kwon, Changwoo Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale foundation models have demonstrated exceptional performance in language and vision tasks. However, the numerous dense matrix-vector operations involved in these large networks pose significant computational challenges during inference. To address these challenges, we introduce the Block-Level Adaptive STructured (BLAST) matrix, designed to learn and leverage efficient structures prevalent in the weight matrices of linear layers within deep learning models. Compared to existing structured matrices, the BLAST matrix offers substantial flexibility, as it can represent various types of structures that are either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. We demonstrate the efficiency of using the BLAST matrix for compressing both language and vision tasks, showing that (i) for medium-sized models such as ViT and GPT-2, training with BLAST weights boosts performance while reducing complexity by 70% and 40%, respectively; and (ii) for large foundation models such as Llama-7B and DiT-XL, the BLAST matrix achieves a 2x compression while exhibiting the lowest performance degradation among all tested structured matrices.

Parameter-Efficient Orthogonal Finetuning via Butterfly Factorization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive structured matrices*\n\n*Bernhard Sch\u00f6lkopf, Adrian Weller, Michael J. Black, Yandong Wen, Songyou Peng, Juyeon Heo, Zhen Liu, Haiwen Feng, Longhui Yu, Yuxuan Xue, Yuliang Xiu, Yao Feng, Zeju Qiu, Weiyang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large foundation models are becoming ubiquitous, but training them from scratch is prohibitively expensive. Thus, efficiently adapting these powerful models to downstream tasks is increasingly important. In this paper, we study a principled finetuning paradigm -- Orthogonal Finetuning (OFT) -- for downstream task adaptation. Despite demonstrating good generalizability, OFT still uses a fairly large number of trainable parameters due to the high dimensionality of orthogonal matrices. To address this, we start by examining OFT from an information transmission perspective, and then identify a few key desiderata that enable better parameter-efficiency. Inspired by how the Cooley-Tukey fast Fourier transform algorithm enables efficient information transmission, we propose an efficient orthogonal parameterization using butterfly structures. We apply this parameterization to OFT, creating a novel parameter-efficient finetuning method, called Orthogonal Butterfly (BOFT). By subsuming OFT as a special case, BOFT introduces a generalized orthogonal finetuning framework. Finally, we conduct an extensive empirical study of adapting large vision transformers, large language models, and text-to-image diffusion models to various downstream tasks in vision and language.\n\n**Published:** 2023-11-10\n\n\n\n#### 3.

AUTOMATA: Gradient Based Data Subset Selection for Compute-Efficient Hyper-parameter Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Rishabh Iyer, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Lucian Popa, Alexandre V. Evfimievski, Aakriti, Guttu Sai Abhishek, KrishnaTeja Killamsetty*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have seen great success in recent years; however, training a deep model is often challenging as its performance heavily depends on the hyper-parameters used. In addition, finding the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, even with state-of-the-art (SOTA) hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) algorithms, can be time-consuming, requiring multiple training runs over the entire dataset for different possible sets of hyper-parameters. Our central insight is that using an informative subset of the dataset for model training runs involved in hyper-parameter optimization, allows us to find the optimal hyper-parameter configuration significantly faster. In this work, we propose AUTOMATA, a gradient-based subset selection framework for hyper-parameter tuning. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of AUTOMATA in hyper-parameter tuning through several experiments on real-world datasets in the text, vision, and tabular domains. Our experiments show that using gradient-based data subsets for hyper-parameter tuning achieves significantly faster turnaround times and speedups of 3$\\times$-30$\\times$ while achieving comparable performance to the hyper-parameters found using the entire dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. Time-LLM: Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Qingsong Wen, Shirui Pan, Yuan-Fang Li, Yuxuan Liang, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiaoming Shi, James Y. Zhang, Zhixuan Chu, Lintao Ma, Shiyu Wang, Ming Jin*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting holds significant importance in many real-world dynamic systems and has been extensively studied. Unlike natural language process (NLP) and computer vision (CV), where a single large model can tackle multiple tasks, models for time series forecasting are often specialized, necessitating distinct designs for different tasks and applications. While pre-trained foundation models have made impressive strides in NLP and CV, their development in time series domains has been constrained by data sparsity. Recent studies have revealed that large language models (LLMs) possess robust pattern recognition and reasoning abilities over complex sequences of tokens. However, the challenge remains in effectively aligning the modalities of time series data and natural language to leverage these capabilities. In this work, we present Time-LLM, a reprogramming framework to repurpose LLMs for general time series forecasting with the backbone language models kept intact. We begin by reprogramming the input time series with text prototypes before feeding it into the frozen LLM to align the two modalities. To augment the LLM's ability to reason with time series data, we propose Prompt-as-Prefix (PaP), which enriches the input context and directs the transformation of reprogrammed input patches. The transformed time series patches from the LLM are finally projected to obtain the forecasts. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that Time-LLM is a powerful time series learner that outperforms state-of-the-art, specialized forecasting models. Moreover, Time-LLM excels in both few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 6. LiDAR4D: Dynamic Neural Fields for Novel Space-time View LiDAR Synthesis\n\n*From Search Query: dynamic sparsity patterns*\n\n*Changjun Jiang, Guang Chen, Weiyi Xue, Fan Lu, Zehan Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Although neural radiance fields (NeRFs) have achieved triumphs in image novel view synthesis (NVS), LiDAR NVS remains largely unexplored. Previous LiDAR NVS methods employ a simple shift from image NVS methods while ignoring the dynamic nature and the large-scale reconstruction problem of LiDAR point clouds. In light of this, we propose LiDAR4D, a differentiable LiDAR-only framework for novel space-time LiDAR view synthesis. In consideration of the sparsity and large-scale characteristics, we design a 4D hybrid representation combined with multi-planar and grid features to achieve effective reconstruction in a coarse-to-fine manner. Furthermore, we introduce geometric constraints derived from point clouds to improve temporal consistency. For the realistic synthesis of LiDAR point clouds, we incorporate the global optimization of ray-drop probability to preserve cross-region patterns. Extensive experiments on KITTI-360 and NuScenes datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method in accomplishing geometry-aware and time-consistent dynamic reconstruction.

This approach efficiently identifies significant projection directions for the gradients, reducing memory usage by updating the projection subspace dynamically based on convergence criteria. This method is particularly useful for full-parameter fine-tuning while maintaining low memory costs, which aligns with the need for efficient gradient computation and parameter updates.\n\n## Adaptive or Dynamic Structure Approaches\n\n- The concept of \"Adaptive Computation Graphs\" is relevant here, as it discusses dynamic structure adaptation that allows models to efficiently allocate computation based on input complexity. This is particularly effective for streaming scenarios and can be adapted for test-time training in autoregressive models (though the reference is not directly linked, the idea is supported by the analysis).\n\n- The AdaRankGrad method also incorporates dynamic structure by adaptively updating the low-rank projection subspace for the gradients of each layer, ensuring that the dimensionality of the approximated gradient decreases as training progresses. This dynamic adjustment helps in maintaining efficiency and stability during training.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Optimization Techniques for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n- The AdaRankGrad method is specifically designed to be memory-efficient by leveraging the natural phenomenon where the dimensionality of the approximated gradient decreases over time. This allows for updates to be performed in a lower-dimensional projection space, reducing memory usage and making it suitable for test-time adaptation.\n\n- The \"Memory-Efficient Adaptive Optimization\" reference highlights the importance of structured sparsity patterns in optimizing gradient computation and parameter updates during adaptation. This aligns with the need for memory-efficient techniques that can handle the specific requirements of test-time training (analysis reference).\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Structured Matrices Maintaining Causality\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly address hardware-efficient implementations, the concept of structured matrices and dynamic sparsity patterns can be crucial for designing hardware-efficient models. For instance, the use of low-rank approximations and adaptive subspace updates in AdaRankGrad can be optimized for hardware implementation by leveraging sparse matrix computations and efficient memory access patterns, which are essential for maintaining causality in autoregressive models.\n\nIn summary, the AdaRankGrad method and the concepts of adaptive computation graphs and memory-efficient adaptive optimization provide strong foundations for improving autoregressive language model design. These approaches focus on efficient gradient computation, dynamic structure adaptation, and memory-efficient optimization, all of which are critical for achieving the desired improvements in test-time training and overall model performance.\n",

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.87)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/24 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.09728, 2019.

Efficiently Modeling Long Sequences with Structured State Spaces (Avg.

Although conventional models including RNNs, CNNs, and Transformers have specialized variants for capturing long dependencies, they still struggle to scale to very long sequences of $10000$ or more steps. A promising recent approach proposed modeling sequences by simulating the fundamental state space model (SSM) \\( x'(t) = Ax(t) + Bu(t), y(t) = Cx(t) + Du(t) \\), and showed that for appropriate choices of the state matrix \\( A \\), this system could handle long-range dependencies mathematically and empirically. However, this method has prohibitive computation and memory requirements, rendering it infeasible as a general sequence modeling solution. We propose the Structured State Space sequence model (S4) based on a new parameterization for the SSM, and show that it can be computed much more efficiently than prior approaches while preserving their theoretical strengths. Our technique involves conditioning \\( A \\) with a low-rank correction, allowing it to be diagonalized stably and reducing the SSM to the well-studied computation of a Cauchy kernel. S4 achieves strong empirical results across a diverse range of established benchmarks, including (i) 91\\% accuracy on sequential CIFAR-10 with no data augmentation or auxiliary losses, on par with a larger 2-D ResNet, (ii) substantially closing the gap to Transformers on image and language modeling tasks, while performing generation $60\\times$ faster (iii) SoTA on every task from the Long Range Arena benchmark, including solving the challenging Path-X task of length 16k that all prior work fails on, while being as efficient as all competitors.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/45 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1609.03499, 2016.

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.04)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

In contrast to most known approaches for linearly structured rank minimization, we do not (a) use the full SVD, nor (b) resort to augmented Lagrangian techniques, nor (c) solve linear systems per iteration. Instead, we formulate the problem differently so that it is amenable to a generalized conditional gradient method, which results in a practical improvement with low per iteration computational cost.

However, they are often memory-inefficient since their preconditioning Kronecker factors are dense, and numerically unstable in low precision as they require matrix inversion or decomposition. These limitations render such methods unpopular for modern mixed-precision training. We address them by (i) formulating an inverse-free KFAC update and (ii) imposing structures in the Kronecker factors, resulting in structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On modern neural networks, we show that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision.

Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix gradient*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Towards Stable Test-Time Adaptation in Dynamic Wild World\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Z. Wen, Yaofo Chen, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) has shown to be effective at tackling distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model on test samples. However, the online model updating of TTA may be unstable and this is often a key obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world. Specifically, TTA may fail to improve or even harm the model performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch sizes, and 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts, which are quite common in practice. In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, \\ie, group or layer norm. However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed and still suffers many failure cases. By digging into the failure cases, we find that certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disturb the model adaption and result in collapsed trivial solutions, \\ie, assigning the same class label for all samples. To address the above collapse issue, we propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy minimization method, called SAR, for further stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1) remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy samples. Promising results demonstrate that SAR performs more stably over prior methods and is computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 57*)\n\n#### 5. TTN: A Domain-Shift Aware Batch Normalization in Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Hyesu Lim, Byeonggeun Kim, J. Choo, Sungha Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer is presented and improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a novel batch normalization strategy for test-time adaptation. Recent test-time adaptation methods heavily rely on the modified batch normalization, i.e., transductive batch normalization (TBN), which calculates the mean and the variance from the current test batch rather than using the running mean and variance obtained from the source data, i.e., conventional batch normalization (CBN). Adopting TBN that employs test batch statistics mitigates the performance degradation caused by the domain shift. However, re-estimating normalization statistics using test data depends on impractical assumptions that a test batch should be large enough and be drawn from i.i.d. stream, and we observed that the previous methods with TBN show critical performance drop without the assumptions. In this paper, we identify that CBN and TBN are in a trade-off relationship and present a new test-time normalization (TTN) method that interpolates the statistics by adjusting the importance between CBN and TBN according to the domain-shift sensitivity of each BN layer. Our proposed TTN improves model robustness to shifted domains across a wide range of batch sizes and in various realistic evaluation scenarios. TTN is widely applicable to other test-time adaptation methods that rely on updating model parameters via backpropagation. We demonstrate that adopting TTN further improves their performance and achieves state-of-the-art performance in various standard benchmarks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 68  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 6. ViDA: Homeostatic Visual Domain Adapter for Continual Test Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Jiaming Liu, Senqiao Yang, Peidong Jia, Ming Lu, Yandong Guo, Wei Xue, Shanghang Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA is designed, explicitly handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge, and a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy is proposed, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA.\n\n**Abstract:** Since real-world machine systems are running in non-stationary environments, Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA) task is proposed to adapt the pre-trained model to continually changing target domains. Recently, existing methods mainly focus on model-based adaptation, which aims to leverage a self-training manner to extract the target domain knowledge. However, pseudo labels can be noisy and the updated model parameters are unreliable under dynamic data distributions, leading to error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting in the continual adaptation process. To tackle these challenges and maintain the model plasticity, we design a Visual Domain Adapter (ViDA) for CTTA, explicitly handling both domain-specific and domain-shared knowledge. Specifically, we first comprehensively explore the different domain representations of the adapters with trainable high-rank or low-rank embedding spaces. Then we inject ViDAs into the pre-trained model, which leverages high-rank and low-rank features to adapt the current domain distribution and maintain the continual domain-shared knowledge, respectively. To exploit the low-rank and high-rank ViDAs more effectively, we further propose a Homeostatic Knowledge Allotment (HKA) strategy, which adaptively combines different knowledge from each ViDA. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Note that, our method can be regarded as a novel transfer paradigm for large-scale models, delivering promising results in adaptation to continually changing distributions.

Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA) is proposed, which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT and reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become the standard approach to building reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, ranging from Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to dialogue systems. However, improving accuracy by increasing the model size requires a large number of hardware computations, which can slow down NLP applications significantly at inference time. To address this issue, we propose a novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA), which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT. This architecture takes advantage of specialized hardware that has low-latency vector-vector operations and higher-latency vector-matrix operations. It also reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy. We present empirical results suggesting that our framework can reduce the latency of sequence-to-sequence and Transformer models used for NMT by a factor of four. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that our VVMA extends to other domains, and we discuss novel hardware for its efficient use.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

A Unified Framework for Structured Low-rank Matrix Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix gradient*\n\n*Pratik Jawanpuria, Bamdev Mishra*\n\n**Abstract:** \n    We consider the problem of learning a low-rank matrix, constrained to lie in a linear subspace, and introduce a novel factorization for modeling such matrices. A salient feature of the proposed factorization scheme is it decouples the low-rank and the structural constraints onto separate factors. We formulate the optimization problem on the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold, where the Riemannian framework allows to develop computationally efficient conjugate gradient and trust-region algorithms. Experiments on problems such as standard/robust/non-negative matrix completion, Hankel matrix learning and multi-task learning demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.\n  \n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2018-7\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Masked Gradient-Based Causal Structure Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix gradient*\n\n*Jun Wang, Zhitang Chen, Haoyang Li, Shengyu Zhu, Zhuangyan Fang, Ignavier Ng*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies the problem of learning causal structures from observational data. We reformulate the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with additive noises in a form parameterized by binary graph adjacency matrix and show that, if the original SEM is identifiable, then the binary adjacency matrix can be identified up to super-graphs of the true causal graph under mild conditions. We then utilize the reformulated SEM to develop a causal structure learning method that can be efficiently trained using gradient-based optimization, by leveraging a smooth characterization on acyclicity and the Gumbel-Softmax approach to approximate the binary adjacency matrix. It is found that the obtained entries are typically near zero or one and can be easily thresholded to identify the edges. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it readily includes different smooth model functions and achieves a much improved performance on most datasets considered.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Comprehensive Survey on Test-Time Adaptation under Distribution Shifts\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Tieniu Tan, Ran He, Jian Liang*\n\n**Abstract:** Machine learning methods strive to acquire a robust model during training that can generalize well to test samples, even under distribution shifts. However, these methods often suffer from a performance drop due to unknown test distributions. Test-time adaptation (TTA), an emerging paradigm, has the potential to adapt a pre-trained model to unlabeled data during testing, before making predictions. Recent progress in this paradigm highlights the significant benefits of utilizing unlabeled data for training self-adapted models prior to inference. In this survey, we divide TTA into several distinct categories, namely, test-time (source-free) domain adaptation, test-time batch adaptation, online test-time adaptation, and test-time prior adaptation. For each category, we provide a comprehensive taxonomy of advanced algorithms, followed by a discussion of different learning scenarios. Furthermore, we analyze relevant applications of TTA and discuss open challenges and promising areas for future research. A comprehensive list of TTA methods can be found at \\url{https://github.com/tim-learn/awesome-test-time-adaptation}.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. AdaRNN: Adaptive Learning and Forecasting of Time Series\n\n*From Search Query: test-time adaptation methods*\n\n*Renjun Xu, Chongjun Wang, Tao Qin, Sinno Pan, Wenjie Feng, Jindong Wang, Yuntao Du*\n\n**Abstract:** Time series has wide applications in the real world and is known to be difficult to forecast. Since its statistical properties change over time, its distribution also changes temporally, which will cause severe distribution shift problem to existing methods. However, it remains unexplored to model the time series in the distribution perspective. In this paper, we term this as Temporal Covariate Shift (TCS). This paper proposes Adaptive RNNs (AdaRNN) to tackle the TCS problem by building an adaptive model that generalizes well on the unseen test data. AdaRNN is sequentially composed of two novel algorithms. First, we propose Temporal Distribution Characterization to better characterize the distribution information in the TS. Second, we propose Temporal Distribution Matching to reduce the distribution mismatch in TS to learn the adaptive TS model. AdaRNN is a general framework with flexible distribution distances integrated. Experiments on human activity recognition, air quality prediction, and financial analysis show that AdaRNN outperforms the latest methods by a classification accuracy of 2.6% and significantly reduces the RMSE by 9.0%. We also show that the temporal distribution matching algorithm can be extended in Transformer structure to boost its performance.\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. ISyNet: Convolutional Neural Networks design for AI accelerator\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware matrix design*\n\n*Yepan Xiong, Ivan Mazurenko, Anastasiia Kargapoltseva, Vladimir Polovnikov, Vladimir Korviakov, Alexey Letunovskiy*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years Deep Learning reached significant results in many practical problems, such as computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition and many others. For many years the main goal of the research was to improve the quality of models, even if the complexity was impractically high. However, for the production solutions, which often require real-time work, the latency of the model plays a very important role. Current state-of-the-art architectures are found with neural architecture search (NAS) taking model complexity into account. However, designing of the search space suitable for specific hardware is still a challenging task. To address this problem we propose a measure of hardware efficiency of neural architecture search space - matrix efficiency measure (MEM); a search space comprising of hardware-efficient operations; a latency-aware scaling method; and ISyNet - a set of architectures designed to be fast on the specialized neural processing unit (NPU) hardware and accurate at the same time. We show the advantage of the designed architectures for the NPU devices on ImageNet and the generalization ability for the downstream classification and detection tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-04\n\n\n\n#### 6. Sextans: A Streaming Accelerator for General-Purpose Sparse-Matrix Dense-Matrix Multiplication\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware matrix design*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparse-Matrix Dense-Matrix multiplication (SpMM) is the key operator for a wide range of applications, including scientific computing, graph processing, and deep learning. Architecting accelerators for SpMM is faced with three challenges - (1) the random memory accessing and unbalanced load in processing because of random distribution of elements in sparse matrices, (2) inefficient data handling of the large matrices which can not be fit on-chip, and (3) anon-general-purpose accelerator design where one accelerator can only process a fixed-size problem. In this paper, we present Sextans, an accelerator for general-purpose SpMM processing. Sextans accelerator features (1) fast random access using on-chip memory, (2) streaming access to off-chip large matrices, (3) PE-aware non-zero scheduling for balanced workload with an II=1 pipeline, and (4) hardware flexibility to enable prototyping the hardware once to support SpMMs of different size as a general-purpose accelerator. We leverage high bandwidth memory (HBM) for the efficient accessing of both sparse and dense matrices. In the evaluation, we present an FPGA prototype Sextans which is executable on a Xilinx U280 HBM FPGA board and a projected prototype Sextans-P with higher bandwidth comparable to V100 and more frequency optimization. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation on 1,400 SpMMs on a wide range of sparse matrices including 50 matrices from SNAP and 150 from SuiteSparse. WecompareSextanswith NVIDIA K80 and V100 GPUs.Sextansachieves a 2.50x geomean speedup over K80 GPU andSextans-Pachieves a 1.14x geomean speedup over V100 GPU (4.94x over K80).

This method uses Woodbury\u2019s Identity, Cholesky decomposition, and matrix-vector products to reduce memory footprint and improve convergence, especially relevant for structured matrices in test-time training.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Techniques for Test-Time Adaptation and Dynamic Parameter Updates\n\n- The Natural GaLore algorithm is particularly useful here as it operates on low-rank approximations of the gradients, significantly reducing the memory footprint. This approach maintains full-parameter learning and can be integrated into existing optimization algorithms with minimal modifications, making it suitable for memory-efficient test-time adaptation.\n\n- Structured matrices like Monarch and Block Tensor-Train (BTT) matrices are designed to be memory-efficient. For example, Monarch matrices are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices, which enhances hardware utilization and reduces memory costs.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Matrix Designs Maintaining Causality and Supporting Efficient Updates\n\n- Monarch matrices are highlighted for their hardware efficiency, being parameterized in a way that optimizes hardware utilization. This design ensures that the matrices can be efficiently computed and updated, maintaining causality and supporting real-time adaptations.\n\n- The BLAST matrix design offers substantial flexibility and can represent various types of structures, either learned from data or computed from pre-existing weight matrices. This adaptability makes it suitable for dynamic and hardware-aware implementations.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- The connection between State Space Models (SSMs) and structured matrices, as discussed in \"Transformers are SSMs,\" provides a framework for deriving efficient methods and algorithms. This equivalence can be leveraged to design matrices that are both expressive and computationally efficient, which is crucial for autoregressive language models.\n\n- The emphasis on block-level structures, such as those in Monarch and BTT matrices, is important for practical hardware acceleration. These structures optimize memory access patterns and cache efficiency, which are critical for maintaining performance during test-time training.\n\nBy incorporating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient in gradient computation, memory usage, and hardware utilization, while also ensuring fast and stable test-time adaptations.\n",

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nChung et al. 2014) as well as more modern variants such as the QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), SRU (Lei 2021; Lei et al. 2017), RWKV (B. Peng, Alcaide, et al. 2023), HGRN (Qin, Yang, and Zhong 2023), and Griffin (Botev et al. 2024; De et al. 2024). These RNNs differ in their parameterizations in various ways, most importantly in the lack of a state expansion. Dimensionality and State Expansion. An important characteristic of SSD, shared by previous SSMs in its lineage (S4, H3, Mamba), is that it is a single-input single-output (SISO) system where input channels are processed independently. This leads to a much larger effective state size of ND where $N$ is the SSM state size (also called state expansion factor) and $D$ is the standard model dimension. Traditional RNNs either have $N=1$ or are multi-input multi-output (MIMO) with dense $B, C$ matrices, either of which leads to a smaller state. While MIMO SSMs have been shown to work well in some domains (Lu et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; J. T. Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), Mamba showed that state expansion is crucial for information-dense domains such as language. One of the main advantages of SSD is allowing for even larger state expansion factors without slowing down the model. Many subsequent works have since adopted state expansion (Section 10.4). Structure. Compared to previous structured SSMs, the main restriction of SSD is on the expressivity of the state transitions $A_{t}$. We note that more general SSMs, such as the case of diagonal $A_{t}$, have the same theoretical efficiency as SSD, but are less hardware-friendly. This is because the dual quadratic form loses its attention-like interpretation and becomes more difficult to compute. Thus compared to Mamba, SSD differs only in a slightly more restrictive form of diagonal $A_{t}$, and trades off this expressivity for improved hardware efficiency (and ease of implementation). We hypothesize that it may be possible to refine our structured matrix algorithms to improve to the general diagonal SSM case as well. ### 10.2 Structured Matrices\n\nThe first viewpoint of the state space duality adopts the viewpoint of these models as matrix sequence transformations or \"matrix mixers\": sequence transformations (Definition 2.1) that can be represented as matrix multiplication (by a $\\mathrm{T} \\times \\mathrm{T}$ matrix) along the sequence dimension $T$. Several such matrix mixers have been proposed before, where the primary axis of variation is the representation of the matrix. These include MLP-Mixer (Tolstikhin et al. 2021) (unstructured matrix), FNet (Lee-Thorp et al. 2021) (Fourier Transform matrix), M2 (Dao, B. Chen, et al. 2022; Dao, Gu, et al. 2019; Dao, Sohoni, et al. 2020; D. Fu et al. 2024) (butterfly/monarch matrix), Toeplitz matrices (Poli et al. 2023; Qin, Han, Weixuan Sun, B. He, et al. 2023), and even more exotic structures (De Sa et al. 2018; Thomas et al. 2018). An important characterization is that efficient (sub-quadratic) matrix sequence transformations are exactly those which have structured matrix mixers. A core result of the SSD framework is viewing SSMs as matrix mixers with a particular structure - semiseparable matrices (Section 3). The linear vs. quadratic duality then takes the form of structured matrix multiplication vs. naive matrix multiplication. The structure matrix representation led to our efficient SSD algorithm through block decompositions of particular semiseparable matrices (Section 6). We note that semiseparable matrices are well-studied in the scientific computing literature, and incorporating those ideas may be a promising avenue for more improvements to state space models. We also suggest that focusing on the matrix mixer viewpoint can lead to more fruitful directions for sequence models, such as designing principled non-causal variants of Mamba, or finding ways to characterize and bridge the gap between softmax attention and sub-quadratic models through analyzing their matrix transformation structure. ## 10.3 (Linear) Attention\n\nCompared to standard (causal) attention, SSD has only two main differences. First, SSD does not use the softmax activation of standard attention (Bahdanau, Cho, and Bengio 2015; Vaswani et al. 2017), which is what gives attention its quadratic complexity. When the softmax is dropped, the sequence can be computed with linear scaling through the linear attention framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). Second, SSD multiplies the logits matrix by an input-dependent 1-semiseparable mask. Thus this mask can be viewed as replacing the softmax in standard attention. This semiseparable mask can also be viewed as providing positional information. The elements $a_{t}$ act as \"gates\" in the RNN sense, or a \"selection\" mechanism (see discussion in Mamba paper), and their cumulative products $a_{j: i}$ control how much interaction is allowed between positions $i$ and $j$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/86 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIndexing. We use Python-style indexing, e.g. $i: j$ refers to the range $(i, i+1, \\ldots, j-1)$ when $i<j$ and $(i, i-1, \\ldots, j+1)$ when $i>j$. For example, for any symbol $v$ we let $v_{j: i}$ for $j \\geq i$ denote the sequence $\\left(v_{j}, \\ldots, v_{i+1}\\right)$. [i] is equivalent to $0: i=(0, \\ldots, i-1)$. For shorthand, we also let $v_{j: i}^{\\times}$denote the product $v_{j} \\times \\cdots \\times v_{i+1} .{ }^{3}$\n\nDimensions. To distinguish from matrices and tensors, we often use capital letters in typewriter fonts (e.g. $D, N, T$ ) to denote dimensions and tensor shapes. Instead of the traditional notation $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{T \\times T}$ we frequently use $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ to reflect tensor shapes in code. Tensor Contractions. We will heavily rely on tensor contraction or einsum notation both for clarity and as a central tool in stating and proving our results. We assume the reader to be familiar with this notation, which is commonly used\n\n[^1]in modern tensor libraries such as numpy. For example, we can use contract(MN, NK $\\rightarrow \\mathrm{MK}$ ) to denote the matrix-matrix multiplication operator, and in our notation contract $(\\mathrm{MN}, \\mathrm{NK} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{MK})(X, Y)$ (which is equivalent to $X \\cdot Y$ ) can be translated to code as numpy.einsum('mn, $\\mathrm{nk} \\rightarrow \\mathrm{mk}^{\\prime}, \\mathrm{X}, \\mathrm{Y}$ ). A large glossary of notation is included in Appendix A. ## 3 State Space Models are Structured Matrices\n\nThis section explores different perspectives of the state space model as a sequence transformation, and outlines properties and algorithms of such maps. The main results of this section are about the equivalence between state space models and a family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices, which imply new efficiency results (Theorems 3.5 and 3.7). ### 3.1 The Matrix Transformation Form of State Space Models\n\nRecall that our definition of an SSM is defined as a parameterized map defined through (2). Our theoretical framework starts by simply writing this transformation as a matrix multiplication mapping the vectors $x \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top} \\mapsto y \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\top}$. By definition, $h_{0}=B_{0} x_{0}$.

Semiseparable matrices are a fundamental matrix structure. We first define these matrices and their properties. Definition 3.1. A (lower triangular) matrix $M$ is N -semiseparable if every submatrix contained in the lower triangular portion (i.e. on or below the diagonal) has rank at most N . We call N the order or rank of the semiseparable matrix. Definition 3.1, and other forms of related \"separable\" structure (e.g. quasiseparable matrices and other definitions of semiseparable matrices) are sometimes called structured rank matrices (or rank-structured matrices) because they are characterized by rank conditions on their submatrices. Semiseparable matrices have many structured representations including the hierarchical semiseparable (HSS), sequential semiseparable (SSS), and Bruhat forms (Pernet and Storjohann 2018). We will primarily use the SSS form. ### 3.2.1 The Sequentially Semiseparable (SSS) Representation\n\nDefinition 3.2. A lower triangular matrix $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ has a N -sequentially semiseparable (SSS) representation if it can be written in the form\n\n$$\nM_{j i}=C_{j}^{\\top} A_{j} \\cdots A_{i+1} B_{i}\n$$\n\nfor vectors $B_{0}, \\ldots, B_{\\mathrm{T}-1}, C_{0}, \\ldots, C_{\\mathrm{T}-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{\\mathbb{N}}$ and matrices $A_{0}, \\ldots, A_{\\mathrm{T}-1} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{N}, \\mathrm{N})}$. We define the operator $\\operatorname{SSS}$ so that $M=\\operatorname{SSS}\\left(A_{0: \\mathrm{T}}, B_{0: \\mathrm{T}}, C_{0: \\mathrm{T}}\\right)$. A fundamental result of semiseparable matrices is that they are exactly equivalent to matrices with SSS representations. One direction can be deduced with a simple constructive proof. Lemma 3.3. An N -SSS matrix $M$ with representation (4) is N -semiseparable. Proof. Consider any off-diagonal block $M_{j: j^{\\prime}, i^{\\prime}: i}$ where $j^{\\prime}>j \\geq i>i^{\\prime}$. This has an explicit rank-N factorization as\n\n$$\n\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc}\nC_{j}^{\\top} A_{j: i^{\\prime}}^{\\times} B_{i^{\\prime}} & \\cdots & C_{j}^{\\top} A_{j: i-1}^{\\times} B_{i-1} \\\\\n\\vdots & & \\vdots \\\\\nC_{j^{\\prime}-1}^{\\top} A_{j^{\\prime}-1: i^{\\prime}}^{\\times} B_{i^{\\prime}} & \\cdots & C_{j^{\\prime}-1}^{\\top} A_{j^{\\prime}-1: i-1}^{\\times} B_{i-1}\n\\end{array}\\right]=\\left[\\begin{array}{c}\nC_{j}^{\\top} A_{j: j}^{\\times} \\\\\n\\vdots \\\\\nC_{j^{\\prime}-1}^{\\top} A_{j^{\\prime}-1: j}^{\\times}\n\\end{array}\\right] A_{j: i-1}^{\\times}\\left[\\begin{array}{lll}\nA_{i-1: i^{\\prime}}^{\\times} B_{i^{\\prime}} & \\cdots & A_{i-1: i-1}^{\\times} B_{i-1}\n\\end{array}\\right]\n$$\n\nEquation (5) will be used extensively in deriving our fast algorithms for sequence models.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/86 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\n## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformers, in particular decoder-only models (e.g. GPT (Brown et al. 2020), Llama (Touvron, Lavril, et al. 2023)) which process input sequences in a causal fashion, are one of the main drivers of modern deep learning's success. Numerous approaches attempt to approximate the core attention layer to address its efficiency issues (Tay et al. 2022), such as scaling quadratically in sequence length during training and requiring a cache of size linear in sequence length during autoregressive generation. In parallel, a class of alternative sequence models, structured state-space models (SSMs), have emerged with linear scaling in sequence length during training and constant state size during generation. They show strong performance on long-range tasks (e.g. S4 (Gu, Goel, and R\u00e9 2022)) and recently matched or beat Transformers on language modeling (e.g. Mamba (Gu and Dao 2023)) at small to moderate scale. However, the development of SSMs have appeared disjoint from the community's collective effort to improve Transformers, such as understanding them theoretically as well as optimizing them on modern hardware. As a result, it is more difficult to understand and experiment with SSMs compared to Transformers, and it remains challenging to train SSMs as efficiently as Transformers from both an algorithmic and systems perspective. Our main goal is to develop a rich body of theoretical connections between structured SSMs and variants of attention. This will allow us to transfer algorithmic and systems optimizations originally developed for Transformers to SSMs, towards the goal of building foundation models that perform better than Transformers while scaling more efficiently in sequence length. A milestone contribution in this direction was the Linear Attention (LA) framework (Katharopoulos et al. 2020), which derived a connection between autoregressive attention and linear RNNs by showing the equivalence between \"dual forms\" of quadratic kernelized attention and a particular linear recurrence. This duality allows new capabilities such as the ability to have both efficient parallelizable training and efficient autoregressive inference. In the same spirit, this paper provides multiple viewpoints connecting linear-complexity SSMs with quadratic-complexity forms to combine the strengths of SSMs and attention. ${ }^{1}$\n\n[^0]State Space Duality. Our framework connecting structured SSMs and variants of attention, which we call structured state space duality (SSD), is made through the abstractions of structured matrices: matrices with subquadratic parameters and multiplication complexity. We develop two broad frameworks for representing sequence models, one as matrix transformations and one as tensor contractions, which each reveal different perspectives of the duality. Our technical contributions include:\n\n- We show an equivalence between state space models and a well-studied family of structured matrices called semiseparable matrices (Section 3). This connection is at the heart our framework, revealing new properties and algorithms for SSMs. A central message of this paper is that different methods of computing state space models can be reframed as various matrix multiplication algorithms on structured matrices. - We significantly improve the theory of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020). We first provide an incisive proof of its recurrent form through the language of tensor contractions, and then generalize it to a new family of structured masked attention (SMA) (Section 4). - We connect SSMs and SMA, showing that they have a large intersection that are duals of each other, possessing both SSM-like linear and attention-like quadratic forms (Section 5). We also prove that any kernel attention method possessing a fast recurrent form must be an SSM. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_4f7a89c99c4204d1f9c3g-02.jpg?height=887&width=831&top_left_y=261&top_left_x=1124)\n\nFigure 1: (Structured State-Space Duality.)

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: SSM structured matrices*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 2. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: SSM structured matrices*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Test-Time Distribution Normalization for Contrastively Learned Visual-language Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time normalization*\n\n*Yi Zhou, Juntao Ren, Fengyu Li, Ramin Zabih, S. Lim*\n\n**TL;DR:** Distribution Normalization (DN) is proposed, where the mean representation of a batch of test samples is approximate and used to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss, which requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference.\n\n**Abstract:** Advances in the field of vision-language contrastive learning have made it possible for many downstream applications to be carried out efficiently and accurately by simply taking the dot product between image and text representations. One of the most representative approaches proposed recently known as CLIP has garnered widespread adoption due to its effectiveness. CLIP is trained with an InfoNCE loss that takes into account both positive and negative samples to help learn a much more robust representation space. This paper reveals that the common downstream practice of taking a dot product is only a zeroth-order approximation of the optimization goal, resulting in a loss of information during test-time. Intuitively, since the model has been optimized based on the InfoNCE loss, test-time procedures should also be in alignment. The question lies in how one can retrieve any semblance of negative samples information during inference in a computationally efficient way. To this end, we propose Distribution Normalization (DN), where we approximate the mean representation of a batch of test samples and use such a mean to represent what would be analogous to negative samples in the InfoNCE loss. DN requires no retraining or fine-tuning and can be effortlessly applied during inference. Extensive experiments on a wide variety of downstream tasks exhibit a clear advantage of DN over the dot product on top of other existing test-time augmentation methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time normalization*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Efficient Test-Time Model Adaptation without Forgetting\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time normalization*\n\n*Shuaicheng Niu, Jiaxiang Wu, Yifan Zhang, Yaofo Chen, S. Zheng, P. Zhao, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An active sample selection criterion is proposed to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation, and a Fisher regularizer is introduced to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes.\n\n**Abstract:** Test-time adaptation (TTA) seeks to tackle potential distribution shifts between training and testing data by adapting a given model w.r.t. any testing sample. This task is particularly important for deep models when the test environment changes frequently. Although some recent attempts have been made to handle this task, we still face two practical challenges: 1) existing methods have to perform backward computation for each test sample, resulting in unbearable prediction cost to many applications; 2) while existing TTA solutions can significantly improve the test performance on out-of-distribution data, they often suffer from severe performance degradation on in-distribution data after TTA (known as catastrophic forgetting). In this paper, we point out that not all the test samples contribute equally to model adaptation, and high-entropy ones may lead to noisy gradients that could disrupt the model. Motivated by this, we propose an active sample selection criterion to identify reliable and non-redundant samples, on which the model is updated to minimize the entropy loss for test-time adaptation. Furthermore, to alleviate the forgetting issue, we introduce a Fisher regularizer to constrain important model parameters from drastic changes, where the Fisher importance is estimated from test samples with generated pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10-C, ImageNet-C, and ImageNet-R verify the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 223  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n#### 6. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware gradient computation*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

HW-NAS-Bench: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search Benchmark\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware gradient computation*\n\n*Chaojian Li, Zhongzhi Yu, Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhao, Haoran You, Qixuan Yu, Yue Wang, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** HW-NAS-Bench is developed, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW- NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NA research more reproducible and accessible and verify that dedicated device-specific HW- Nas can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.\n\n**Abstract:** HardWare-aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has recently gained tremendous attention by automating the design of DNNs deployed in more resource-constrained daily life devices. Despite its promising performance, developing optimal HW-NAS solutions can be prohibitively challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in the algorithm, micro-architecture, and device-specific compilation. First, to determine the hardware-cost to be incorporated into the NAS process, existing works mostly adopt either pre-collected hardware-cost look-up tables or device-specific hardware-cost models. Both of them limit the development of HW-NAS innovations and impose a barrier-to-entry to non-hardware experts. Second, similar to generic NAS, it can be notoriously difficult to benchmark HW-NAS algorithms due to their significant required computational resources and the differences in adopted search spaces, hyperparameters, and hardware devices. To this end, we develop HW-NAS-Bench, the first public dataset for HW-NAS research which aims to democratize HW-NAS research to non-hardware experts and make HW-NAS research more reproducible and accessible. To design HW-NAS-Bench, we carefully collected the measured/estimated hardware performance of all the networks in the search spaces of both NAS-Bench-201 and FBNet, on six hardware devices that fall into three categories (i.e., commercial edge devices, FPGA, and ASIC). Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the collected measurements in HW-NAS-Bench to provide insights for HW-NAS research. Finally, we demonstrate exemplary user cases to (1) show that HW-NAS-Bench allows non-hardware experts to perform HW-NAS by simply querying it and (2) verify that dedicated device-specific HW-NAS can indeed lead to optimal accuracy-cost trade-offs.

Liquid Structural State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: SSM structured matrices*\n\n*Daniela Rus, Alexander Amini, Makram Chahine, Tsun-Hsuan Wang, Mathias Lechner, Ramin Hasani*\n\n**Abstract:** A proper parametrization of state transition matrices of linear state-space models (SSMs) followed by standard nonlinearities enables them to efficiently learn representations from sequential data, establishing the state-of-the-art on a large series of long-range sequence modeling benchmarks. In this paper, we show that we can improve further when the structural SSM such as S4 is given by a linear liquid time-constant (LTC) state-space model. LTC neural networks are causal continuous-time neural networks with an input-dependent state transition module, which makes them learn to adapt to incoming inputs at inference. We show that by using a diagonal plus low-rank decomposition of the state transition matrix introduced in S4, and a few simplifications, the LTC-based structural state-space model, dubbed Liquid-S4, achieves the new state-of-the-art generalization across sequence modeling tasks with long-term dependencies such as image, text, audio, and medical time-series, with an average performance of 87.32% on the Long-Range Arena benchmark. On the full raw Speech Command recognition, dataset Liquid-S4 achieves 96.78% accuracy with a 30% reduction in parameter counts compared to S4. The additional gain in performance is the direct result of the Liquid-S4's kernel structure that takes into account the similarities of the input sequence samples during training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-26\n\n\n\n#### 3. EfficientAD: Accurate Visual Anomaly Detection at Millisecond-Level Latencies\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time normalization*\n\n*Rebecca K\u00f6nig, Lars Heckler, Kilian Batzner*\n\n**Abstract:** Detecting anomalies in images is an important task, especially in real-time computer vision applications. In this work, we focus on computational efficiency and propose a lightweight feature extractor that processes an image in less than a millisecond on a modern GPU. We then use a student-teacher approach to detect anomalous features. We train a student network to predict the extracted features of normal, i.e., anomaly-free training images. The detection of anomalies at test time is enabled by the student failing to predict their features. We propose a training loss that hinders the student from imitating the teacher feature extractor beyond the normal images. It allows us to drastically reduce the computational cost of the student-teacher model, while improving the detection of anomalous features. We furthermore address the detection of challenging logical anomalies that involve invalid combinations of normal local features, for example, a wrong ordering of objects. We detect these anomalies by efficiently incorporating an autoencoder that analyzes images globally. We evaluate our method, called EfficientAD, on 32 datasets from three industrial anomaly detection dataset collections. EfficientAD sets new standards for both the detection and the localization of anomalies. At a latency of two milliseconds and a throughput of six hundred images per second, it enables a fast handling of anomalies. Together with its low error rate, this makes it an economical solution for real-world applications and a fruitful basis for future research.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-25\n\n\n\n#### 4. StyleMelGAN: An Efficient High-Fidelity Adversarial Vocoder with Temporal Adaptive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient test-time normalization*\n\n*Guillaume Fuchs, Nicola Pia, Ahmed Mustafa*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, neural vocoders have surpassed classical speech generation approaches in naturalness and perceptual quality of the synthesized speech. Computationally heavy models like WaveNet and WaveGlow achieve best results, while lightweight GAN models, e.g. MelGAN and Parallel WaveGAN, remain inferior in terms of perceptual quality. We therefore propose StyleMelGAN, a lightweight neural vocoder allowing synthesis of high-fidelity speech with low computational complexity. StyleMelGAN employs temporal adaptive normalization to style a low-dimensional noise vector with the acoustic features of the target speech. For efficient training, multiple random-window discriminators adversarially evaluate the speech signal analyzed by a filter bank, with regularization provided by a multi-scale spectral reconstruction loss. The highly parallelizable speech generation is several times faster than real-time on CPUs and GPUs. MUSHRA and P.800 listening tests show that StyleMelGAN outperforms prior neural vocoders in copy-synthesis and Text-to-Speech scenarios.\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-03\n\n\n\n#### 5. On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware gradient computation*\n\n*Song Han, Chuang Gan, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Ligeng Zhu, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

FrostNet: Towards Quantization-Aware Network Architecture Search\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware gradient computation*\n\n*Taehoon Kim, Jihoon Yang, Youngjoon Yoo*\n\n**Abstract:** INT8 quantization has become one of the standard techniques for deploying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) on edge devices to reduce the memory and computational resource usages. By analyzing quantized performances of existing mobile-target network architectures, we can raise an issue regarding the importance of network architecture for optimal INT8 quantization. In this paper, we present a new network architecture search (NAS) procedure to find a network that guarantees both full-precision (FLOAT32) and quantized (INT8) performances. We first propose critical but straightforward optimization method which enables quantization-aware training (QAT) : floating-point statistic assisting (StatAssist) and stochastic gradient boosting (GradBoost). By integrating the gradient-based NAS with StatAssist and GradBoost, we discovered a quantization-efficient network building block, Frost bottleneck. Furthermore, we used Frost bottleneck as the building block for hardware-aware NAS to obtain quantization-efficient networks, FrostNets, which show improved quantization performances compared to other mobile-target networks while maintaining competitive FLOAT32 performance. Our FrostNets achieve higher recognition accuracy than existing CNNs with comparable latency when quantized, due to higher latency reduction rate (average 65%).\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-17\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of an autoregressive language model using State Space Models (SSMs) and addressing the specific areas of efficient implementations, test-time adaptation, and hardware efficiency, here are some key findings and references:\n\n### Efficient Implementations of SSM-Style Structured Matrices\n\n1. **MAMBA and SC-MAMBA2 Models**:\n   These models integrate SSMs with deep learning architectures, offering efficient and scalable modeling.

This approach helps in maintaining stability during test-time adaptation by adjusting the importance between different normalization statistics according to the domain-shift sensitivity[Analysis Note, Section 2].\n\n2. **Stable Test-Time Adaptation**:\n   The work by Niu et al. highlights the importance of handling mixed distribution shifts, small batch sizes, and online imbalanced label distribution shifts during test-time adaptation. This emphasizes the need for adaptive normalization strategies that can stabilize the model performance under varying test conditions[Analysis Note, Section 3].\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Methods for Structured Matrix Operations and Gradient Computation\n\n1. **Hardware-Aware Transformers**:\n   The HAT (Hardware-Aware Transformers) approach focuses on optimizing transformer models for hardware efficiency. This includes designing block-level structures, optimizing memory access patterns, and utilizing cache-friendly memory layouts. These techniques can be adapted for SSM-style structured matrices to improve efficiency.\n\n2. **Convolutional Implementation of SSMs**:\n   The MAMBA and SC-MAMBA2 models implement SSMs in a convolutional manner, which can be highly parallelizable and efficient for hardware. This involves transforming continuous matrices into discrete counterparts and using convolution kernels, which can be optimized for hardware-specific computations.\n\n3. **Online Learning Perspective for SSMs**:\n   The Longhorn model's approach to SSM design through an online learning perspective avoids the inefficiencies of traditional backpropagation through time. This method ensures linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training, which are beneficial for hardware efficiency.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage the efficiency of SSM-style structured matrices, incorporate advanced normalization techniques for stable test-time adaptation, and optimize for hardware efficiency through block-level parallelism and cache-friendly designs.\n",

We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/86 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nThe other direction is wellestablished in the literature on semiseparable matrices. Proposition 3.4. Every N -semiseparable matrix has a N -SSS representation. Furthermore, note that although Definition 3.2 involves $O\\left(N^{2} \\mathrm{~T}\\right)$ parameters for the representation (in particular to store the A matrices), it can actually be compressed down to $O(\\mathrm{NT})$ parameters, which is asymptotically tight (Pernet, Signargout, and Villard 2023). Therefore in the rest of this paper we will conflate the structured matrix class (Definition 3.1) and a particular representation of it (Definition 3.2); we will always use this representation instead of other candidates. In turn we will use N -SS to refer to an N -semiseparable matrix in SSS form. Semiseparable matrices are a fundamental matrix structure and have many important properties. They are deeply related to recurrences at large, and can be defined by multiple characterizations (e.g. Definitions 3.1 and 3.2) which reveal different connections and efficient algorithms for them. We mention some of their other properties in Appendix C.1. Remark 2. The notion of semiseparability is very broad and many similar but subtlely different definitions appear in the literature; our definitions may differ slightly from other conventions. First, because we are primarily concerned with causal or autoregressive settings in this paper, we have restricted the definition of semiseparability to the triangular case; Definition 3.1 more formally might be called ( $\\mathrm{N}, 0$ )-semiseparability by some authors. Some authors may also instead refer to it as a form of quasiseparability (Eidelman and Gohberg 1999; Pernet 2016).\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/86 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\n2022; Thomas et al. 2018). Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n#### 2. Hydra: Bidirectional State Space Models Through Generalized Matrix Mixers (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Sukjun Hwang, Aakash Lahoti, Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** A wide array of sequence models are built on a framework modeled after Transformers, comprising alternating sequence mixer and channel mixer layers. This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks. As a drop-in replacement for attention layers, Hydra outperforms BERT by 0.8 points on the GLUE benchmark and ViT by 2% Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/32 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:1409.0473 (2014).

R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/35 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\nFigure 3 also includes a baseline row factoring a matrix of appropriately scaled i.i.d. Gaussian entries, to indicate typical errors for factoring an unstructured matrix. ### 4.2 Neural Network Compression\n\nMany structured matrix approaches have been proposed to replace fully-connected (FC) layers of neural networks, to speed up training and inference, and to reduce the memory consumption. These structured matrices are cleverly designed by combining commonly used fast transforms. For example, Fastfood [24] and Deep Fried Convnets [47] compose the fast Hadamard transform and fast Fourier transforms, and Sindhwani et al. 40] use Toeplitz-like matrices that can be written as a sequence of 2 or 4 FFTs. However, the design choice for these light-weight replacement layers is restricted by the set of known and implementable transforms. On the first benchmark task of compressing a single hidden layer model, the real version of BPBP has better classification accuracy than a fully-connected layer on all datasets tested, and uses more than 56X fewer parameters (Table 1); the complex version performs even better with a slight parameter increase. The previous best methods fail to achieve this on the more challenging CIFAR-10 dataset at the same parameter budget [42]. We further demonstrate that this layer is effective as a lightweight addition to a larger-scale ResNet architecture. Fully-connected Previous work showed that structured matrix approaches based on the low displacement rank framework, including Toeplitz-like 40, LDR-SD and LDR-TD matrices 42, compare very favorably to other compression approaches. Following previous experimental settings [5, 40, 42, we compare our proposed classes to several baselines using dense structured matrices to compress the hidden layer of a single hidden layer neural network. Competing methods include simple low-rank factorizations [9], circulant matrices (equivalent to 1-dimensional convolutions) [6], the adaptive Fastfood transform 47, and low displacement rank methods 40, 42 which implicitly define a structured matrix through a displacement equation and admit specialized fast divide-and-conquer algorithms 8.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 12 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: semiseparable matrices neural networks, efficient structured matrix gradient, memory-efficient test-time adaptation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 8 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: semiseparable matrices neural networks*\n\n*Changwoo Lee, Hun-Seok Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel, and defines a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: semiseparable matrices neural networks*\n\n*Xinyi Wu, A. Ajorlou, Zihui Wu, A. Jadbabaie*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is established that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially.\n\n**Abstract:** Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

In contrast to most known approaches for linearly structured rank minimization, we do not (a) use the full SVD, nor (b) resort to augmented Lagrangian techniques, nor (c) solve linear systems per iteration. Instead, we formulate the problem differently so that it is amenable to a generalized conditional gradient method, which results in a practical improvement with low per iteration computational cost.

Turner, Alireza Makhzani*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision, closing a gap between first- and second-order methods in modern low-precision training.\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order methods such as KFAC can be useful for neural net training. However, they are often memory-inefficient since their preconditioning Kronecker factors are dense, and numerically unstable in low precision as they require matrix inversion or decomposition. These limitations render such methods unpopular for modern mixed-precision training. We address them by (i) formulating an inverse-free KFAC update and (ii) imposing structures in the Kronecker factors, resulting in structured inverse-free natural gradient descent (SINGD). On modern neural networks, we show that SINGD is memory-efficient and numerically robust, in contrast to KFAC, and often outperforms AdamW even in half precision.

MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient test-time adaptation*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Efficient Meta Lifelong-Learning with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient test-time adaptation*\n\n*Zirui Wang, Sanket Vaibhav Mehta, B. P\u00f3czos, J. Carbonell*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies three common principles of lifelong learning methods and proposes an efficient meta-lifelong framework that combines them in a synergistic fashion and alleviates both catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer at the same time.\n\n**Abstract:** Current natural language processing models work well on a single task, yet they often fail to continuously learn new tasks without forgetting previous ones as they are re-trained throughout their lifetime, a challenge known as lifelong learning. State-of-the-art lifelong language learning methods store past examples in episodic memory and replay them at both training and inference time. However, as we show later in our experiments, there are three significant impediments: (1) needing unrealistically large memory module to achieve good performance, (2) suffering from negative transfer, (3) requiring multiple local adaptation steps for each test example that significantly slows down the inference speed. In this paper, we identify three common principles of lifelong learning methods and propose an efficient meta-lifelong framework that combines them in a synergistic fashion. To achieve sample efficiency, our method trains the model in a manner that it learns a better initialization for local adaptation. Extensive experiments on text classification and question answering benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework by achieving state-of-the-art performance using merely 1% memory size and narrowing the gap with multi-task learning. We further show that our method alleviates both catastrophic forgetting and negative transfer at the same time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 8. Efficient Test-Time Adaptation for Super-Resolution with Second-Order Degradation and Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient test-time adaptation*\n\n*Zeshuai Deng, Zhuokun Chen, Shuaicheng Niu, Thomas H. Li, Bohan Zhuang, Mingkui Tan*\n\n**TL;DR:** An efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR is presented, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types, and designs a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier.\n\n**Abstract:** Image super-resolution (SR) aims to learn a mapping from low-resolution (LR) to high-resolution (HR) using paired HR-LR training images. Conventional SR methods typically gather the paired training data by synthesizing LR images from HR images using a predetermined degradation model, e.g., Bicubic down-sampling. However, the realistic degradation type of test images may mismatch with the training-time degradation type due to the dynamic changes of the real-world scenarios, resulting in inferior-quality SR images. To address this, existing methods attempt to estimate the degradation model and train an image-specific model, which, however, is quite time-consuming and impracticable to handle rapidly changing domain shifts. Moreover, these methods largely concentrate on the estimation of one degradation type (e.g., blur degradation), overlooking other degradation types like noise and JPEG in real-world test-time scenarios, thus limiting their practicality. To tackle these problems, we present an efficient test-time adaptation framework for SR, named SRTTA, which is able to quickly adapt SR models to test domains with different/unknown degradation types. Specifically, we design a second-order degradation scheme to construct paired data based on the degradation type of the test image, which is predicted by a pre-trained degradation classifier. Then, we adapt the SR model by implementing feature-level reconstruction learning from the initial test image to its second-order degraded counterparts, which helps the SR model generate plausible HR images. Extensive experiments are conducted on newly synthesized corrupted DIV2K datasets with 8 different degradations and several real-world datasets, demonstrating that our SRTTA framework achieves an impressive improvement over existing methods with satisfying speed.

A Unified Framework for Structured Low-rank Matrix Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix gradient*\n\n*Pratik Jawanpuria, Bamdev Mishra*\n\n**Abstract:** \n    We consider the problem of learning a low-rank matrix, constrained to lie in a linear subspace, and introduce a novel factorization for modeling such matrices. A salient feature of the proposed factorization scheme is it decouples the low-rank and the structural constraints onto separate factors. We formulate the optimization problem on the Riemannian spectrahedron manifold, where the Riemannian framework allows to develop computationally efficient conjugate gradient and trust-region algorithms. Experiments on problems such as standard/robust/non-negative matrix completion, Hankel matrix learning and multi-task learning demonstrate the efficacy of our approach.\n  \n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2018-7\n\n**Published:** 2018-07-01\n\n\n\n#### 2. Masked Gradient-Based Causal Structure Learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient structured matrix gradient*\n\n*Jun Wang, Zhitang Chen, Haoyang Li, Shengyu Zhu, Zhuangyan Fang, Ignavier Ng*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper studies the problem of learning causal structures from observational data. We reformulate the Structural Equation Model (SEM) with additive noises in a form parameterized by binary graph adjacency matrix and show that, if the original SEM is identifiable, then the binary adjacency matrix can be identified up to super-graphs of the true causal graph under mild conditions. We then utilize the reformulated SEM to develop a causal structure learning method that can be efficiently trained using gradient-based optimization, by leveraging a smooth characterization on acyclicity and the Gumbel-Softmax approach to approximate the binary adjacency matrix. It is found that the obtained entries are typically near zero or one and can be easily thresholded to identify the edges. We conduct experiments on synthetic and real datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, and show that it readily includes different smooth model functions and achieves a much improved performance on most datasets considered.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. EcoTTA: Memory-Efficient Continual Test-time Adaptation via Self-distilled Regularization\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient test-time adaptation*\n\n*Sungha Choi, In So Kweon, Jungsoo Lee, Junha Song*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a simple yet effective approach that improves continual test-time adaptation (TTA) in a memory-efficient manner. TTA may primarily be conducted on edge devices with limited memory, so reducing memory is crucial but has been overlooked in previous TTA studies. In addition, long-term adaptation often leads to catastrophic forgetting and error accumulation, which hinders applying TTA in real-world deployments. Our approach consists of two components to address these issues. First, we present lightweight meta networks that can adapt the frozen original networks to the target domain. This novel architecture minimizes memory consumption by decreasing the size of intermediate activations required for backpropagation. Second, our novel self-distilled regularization controls the output of the meta networks not to deviate significantly from the output of the frozen original networks, thereby preserving well-trained knowledge from the source domain. Without additional memory, this regularization prevents error accumulation and catastrophic forgetting, resulting in stable performance even in long-term test-time adaptation. We demonstrate that our simple yet effective strategy outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on various benchmarks for image classification and semantic segmentation tasks. Notably, our proposed method with ResNet-50 and WideResNet-40 takes 86% and 80% less memory than the recent state-of-the-art method, CoTTA.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-03\n\n\n\n#### 4. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory-efficient test-time adaptation*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using the specified keywords and details, here are some key findings and references that align with the researcher's goals:\n\n## Implementations and Applications of Semiseparable Matrices in Neural Networks\n\n- The use of semiseparable matrices in neural networks is prominently discussed in the context of State Space Models (SSMs). For instance, Mamba-2, a variant of SSMs, utilizes semiseparable lower triangular matrices to achieve efficient sequence transformations. This approach allows for linear computational complexity with respect to sequence length and is more GPU-efficient compared to traditional recurrence-based methods.\n\n- The paper on Taipan introduces a hybrid architecture that combines the efficiency of Mamba (which uses semiseparable matrices) with enhanced long-range dependency handling through Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This integration maintains the linear memory usage characteristic of SSMs while improving performance in tasks requiring long-range dependencies.\n\n## Efficient Gradient Computation Methods for Structured Matrices\n\n- Efficient gradient computation for structured matrices is a crucial aspect of the Mamba and Taipan architectures. Mamba-2 reformulates state-space equations as a single matrix multiplication using semiseparable matrices, which enables efficient gradient computation. This method is particularly efficient because it avoids the quadratic time complexity of traditional attention mechanisms, instead using linear-time computations.\n\n- The structured state-space duality (SSD) framework provides a theoretical basis for deriving efficient algorithms and methods for computing gradients in these models. This framework allows for both linear and quadratic computation paths, depending on the specific requirements of the task.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Techniques for Test-Time Adaptation with Structured Matrices\n\n- Memory efficiency during test-time adaptation is a key benefit of using SSMs with semiseparable matrices. Taipan, for example, retains the linear memory usage characteristic of SSMs, which is significant for handling extremely long sequences. This is achieved by focusing the attention mechanism on a subset of important tokens, reducing the computational costs associated with full attention modules.\n\n- The Mamba architecture also ensures constant memory usage during inference, which is critical for test-time adaptation. By leveraging matrix multiplication and semiseparable matrices, Mamba-2 achieves faster training speeds and maintains linear scaling with sequence length, making it highly memory-efficient.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- The design of structured matrices, such as block-diagonal structures, is important for hardware efficiency and parallelization. This is highlighted in the context of Monarch matrices, which are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization[Analysis Note].\n\n- Efficient matrix multiplication primitives and careful management of memory access patterns are crucial for optimizing the performance of these models during both training and inference[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only efficient in terms of computational and memory resources but also highly effective in handling long-range dependencies and adapting at test time.\n",

(2016); Hinton \\& Plaut (1987). In the brain, short-term and long-term memory have developed in a specialized way. Short-term memory is allowed to change very quickly to react to immediate sensory inputs and perception. It also tends towards high capacity storage of all pieces of information which may be relevant for future reasoning Jonides et al. (2008); Atkinson \\& Shiffrin (1971); Averbach \\& Coriell (1961). By contrast, long-term memory changes slowly Kolodner (1983); Jeneson \\& Squire (2012), is highly selective and involves repeated consolidation. It contains a set of memories that summarize the entire past, only storing details about observations which are most relevant Goelet et al.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

These models leverage the attention mechanism (Vaswani et al., 2017), which computes a dependency score for every pair\n\n[^0]of tokens in an input sequence. Therefore, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to the sequence length. However, such a complexity is computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences, such as text summarization (Nallapati et al., 2016) and question answering (Kwiatkowski et al., 2019). For example, empirically we find that a Transformer model ( 250 M parameters) consumes over 80 G of GPU memory when the sequence length is 8 k . Additionally, Transformer models equipped with the full attention are easy to overfit because of the lack of structural biases (Lin et al., 2022). That is, the attention mechanism does not assume any structural prior over the inputs. For example, we even need order information (e.g., through sinusoidal encoding) to train a Transformer model. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible such that Transformer models may easily overfit to the noise. This significantly limits the models' practicality in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is often low. Empirically, we find that on a two-way classification task, Transformer with the full attention has a $57.5 \\%$ accuracy, nearly $30 \\%$ less than stateof-the-art methods with powerful structural biases (see Section 4.1 for details). Various approaches have been proposed to reduce the quadratic complexity and/or to introduce structural biases. In approximation methods, we approximate the full attention using fast algorithms with linear complexity. For example, we can approximate and speedup the computation of the attention score matrix (i.e., $\\operatorname{softmax}\\left(\\mathbf{Q K}^{\\top} / \\sqrt{d}\\right)$ in Eq. 1) using low-rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020b) or kernel methods (Peng et al., 2021). However, even though these methods reduce the complexity of full attention, they inherit the lack of structural bias issue. To incorporate structural biases to the Transformer model, partial attention methods are pro-\nposed. Such methods can be further categorized into sparse attention and clustering methods. In sparse attention (Beltagy et al., 2020), each token only attends to a subset of all the tokens according to pre-defined sparsity patterns. In clustering methods (Kitaev et al., 2020), tokens are divided into several clusters, and only intra-cluster attention is performed. However, the introduced structural biases restrict the models' ability to capture global information. For example, in local-window attention, we assume each token only depends on its neighbors, such that we inevitably lose long-range and global information. Contrary to partial attention, state space models (SSMs) introduce a different structural bias (Gu et al., 2021), which is tailored for computing global information. Specifically, SSMs design fixed global dependency patterns that facilitate effective and efficient computation. These models can be seen as linear recurrent neural networks with specifically designed fixed weights. Moreover, efficient algorithms are crafted for training such models. However, the integrated structural bias is restrictive in that SSMs are not refined enough to capture local information. This is because unlike attention, SSMs do not explicitly compute dependencies between input tokens. We propose SPADE, short for State space $\\underline{\\text { Augmente }} \\underline{\\mathbf{D}}$ TransformEr. The proposed model is a multi-layer Transformer model that can effectively and efficiently capture complicated dependencies. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of the model, such that after this layer, inputs are integrated with global information. Because the SSM only provides coarse global information, at the subsequent top layers of SPADE, we employ local attention variants to capture more complicated and refined local information. In other words, in SPADE, the SSM induces a strong structural bias that augments global information, and it complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. We demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of SPADE on various natural language processing tasks. First, we show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches on the Long Range Arena (Tay et al., 2021b) benchmark, which is designed to test models' ability in modeling long sequences. Second, we show that in autoregressive language modeling, SPADE is not only significantly faster than the vanilla Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), but also yields better performance. Third, we demonstrate the scalability of SPADE by conducting language model pre-training and finetuning experiments. Specifically, we pre-train an encoder-decoder model similar to T5 (Raffel et al., 2020). And we fine-tune the model on various tasks, including natural language understanding and natural language generation benchmarks. In all the settings, SPADE outperforms the baselines.\n```\n\n#### 5.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

Visualizing the training trajectories of baseline LAs and our augmented LAs. application scenario, we profiled the LLaMA-2-7B model across four settings of prefill and decode sizes, adhering to benchmarks commonly used in academia and industry, as summarized in Tab. 10. | (Prefill, Decode) | Task | Dataset | Referenced Paper |\n| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| $(340,160)$ | Chat | ShareGPT | (Kwon et al., 2023) |\n| $(60,20)$ | Chat | Stanford Alpaca | (Taori et al., 2023) |\n| $(7000,200)$ | Summarization | ArXiv Summarization | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n| $(1700,400)$ | Chat | OpenChat ShareGPT 4 | (Agrawal et al., 2024) |\n\nAs shown in Tab. 11, profiling the LLaMA-2-7B models under the four prefill and decode size settings reveals that the average runtime latency attributed to attention and FFNs accounts for $55 \\%$ and $21 \\%$ of the total runtime across these settings, respectively. This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Score: 0.91)\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.91)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 3.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Just read twice: closing the recall gap for recurrent language models (Avg. Score: 0.60)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.60)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

This is achieved by integrating out the self-attention layer in Transformers, producing a modified dynamics of MLP layers only. JoMA removes unrealistic assumptions in previous analysis (e.g., lack of residual connection) and predicts that the attention first becomes sparse (to learn salient tokens), then dense (to learn less salient tokens) in the presence of nonlinear activations, while in the linear case, it is consistent with existing works that show attention becomes sparse over time. We leverage JoMA to qualitatively explains how tokens are combined to form hierarchies in multilayer Transformers, when the input tokens are generated by a latent hierarchical generative model. Experiments on models trained from real-world dataset (Wikitext2/Wikitext103) and various pre-trained models (OPT, Pythia) verify our theoretical findings.

Veeling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error.\n\n**Abstract:** Markov processes are widely used mathematical models for describing dynamic systems in various fields. However, accurately simulating large-scale systems at long time scales is computationally expensive due to the short time steps required for accurate integration. In this paper, we introduce an inference process that maps complex systems into a simplified representational space and models large jumps in time. To achieve this, we propose Time-lagged Information Bottleneck (T-IB), a principled objective rooted in information theory, which aims to capture relevant temporal features while discarding high-frequency information to simplify the simulation task and minimize the inference error. Our experiments demonstrate that T-IB learns information-optimal representations for accurately modeling the statistical properties and dynamics of the original process at a selected time lag, outperforming existing time-lagged dimensionality reduction methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. VIBE: Topic-Driven Temporal Adaptation for Twitter Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Yuji Zhang, Jing Li, Wenjie Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work reflects feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and proposes a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions, which utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time.\n\n**Abstract:** Language features are evolving in real-world social media, resulting in the deteriorating performance of text classification in dynamics. To address this challenge, we study temporal adaptation, where models trained on past data are tested in the future. Most prior work focused on continued pretraining or knowledge updating, which may compromise their performance on noisy social media data. To tackle this issue, we reflect feature change via modeling latent topic evolution and propose a novel model, VIBE: Variational Information Bottleneck for Evolutions. Concretely, we first employ two Information Bottleneck (IB) regularizers to distinguish past and future topics. Then, the distinguished topics work as adaptive features via multi-task training with timestamp and class label prediction. In adaptive learning, VIBE utilizes retrieved unlabeled data from online streams created posterior to training data time. Substantial Twitter experiments on three classification tasks show that our model, with only 3% of data, significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art continued-pretraining methods.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M. Larson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression, and reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of P AP perturbation.\n\n**Abstract:** Perturbative availability poisons (PAPs) add small changes to images to prevent their use for model training. Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 8. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Exact hierarchical reductions of dynamical models via linear transformations\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Transformer*\n\n*Gleb Pogudin, Elizaveta Demitraki, Alexander Demin*\n\n**Abstract:** Dynamical models described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are a fundamental tool in the sciences and engineering. Exact reduction aims at producing a lower-dimensional model in which each macro-variable can be directly related to the original variables, and it is thus a natural step towards the model's formal analysis and mechanistic understanding. We present an algorithm which, given a polynomial ODE model, computes a longest possible chain of exact linear reductions of the model such that each reduction refines the previous one, thus giving a user control of the level of detail preserved by the reduction. This significantly generalizes over the existing approaches which compute only the reduction of the lowest dimension subject to an approach-specific constraint. The algorithm reduces finding exact linear reductions to a question about representations of finite-dimensional algebras. We provide an implementation of the algorithm, demonstrate its performance on a set of benchmarks, and illustrate the applicability via case studies.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Linear Transformer*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Alex Lamb, Nitesh B. Gundavarapu, Yoshua Bengio, Nan Rosemary Ke, Anirudh Goyal, Kshitij Gupta, Aniket Didolkar*\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-30\n\n\n\n#### 4. STG-Mamba: Spatial-Temporal Graph Learning via Selective State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Temporal Latent Bottleneck*\n\n*Adelle Coster, Wenjie Zhang, Hanchen Wang, Lincan Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial-Temporal Graph (STG) data is characterized as dynamic, heterogenous, and non-stationary, leading to the continuous challenge of spatial-temporal graph learning. In the past few years, various GNN-based methods have been proposed to solely focus on mimicking the relationships among node individuals of the STG network, ignoring the significance of modeling the intrinsic features that exist in STG system over time. In contrast, modern Selective State Space Models (SSSMs) present a new approach which treat STG Network as a system, and meticulously explore the STG system's dynamic state evolution across temporal dimension. In this work, we introduce Spatial-Temporal Graph Mamba (STG-Mamba) as the first exploration of leveraging the powerful selective state space models for STG learning by treating STG Network as a system, and employing the Spatial-Temporal Selective State Space Module (ST-S3M) to precisely focus on the selected STG latent features. Furthermore, to strengthen GNN's ability of modeling STG data under the setting of selective state space models, we propose Kalman Filtering Graph Neural Networks (KFGN) for dynamically integrate and upgrade the STG embeddings from different temporal granularities through a learnable Kalman Filtering statistical theory-based approach. Extensive empirical studies are conducted on three benchmark STG forecasting datasets, demonstrating the performance superiority and computational efficiency of STG-Mamba. It not only surpasses existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of STG forecasting performance, but also effectively alleviate the computational bottleneck of large-scale graph networks in reducing the computational cost of FLOPs and test inference time.

Maximizing Communication Efficiency for Large-scale Training via 0/1 Adam\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Christopher De Sa, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yucheng Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** 1-bit gradient compression and local steps are two representative techniques that enable drastic communication reduction in distributed SGD. Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT). In this paper, we demonstrate the non-linearity in Adam causes slow convergence even when 1-bit compression or local steps are individually applied. To alleviate this limitation, we propose 0/1 Adam that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. 0/1 Adam performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for 0/1 Adam on smooth non-convex objectives. On various large-scale benchmarks such as BERT-Base, BERT-Large, GPT-2 pre-training and ImageNet, we demonstrate on up to 128 GPUs that 0/1 Adam is able to reduce up to 87% of data volume, 54% of communication rounds, and achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher training throughput and end-to-end training time reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline 1-bit Adam; while enjoying the same statistical convergence speed and end task model accuracy on GLUE dataset and ImageNet validation set.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Current innovations, including State Space Models, were initially celebrated for surpassing Transformer performance on language modeling tasks. However, these models have revealed deficiencies in essential In-Context Learning capabilities - a domain where the Transformer traditionally shines. The Based model emerged as a hybrid solution, blending a Linear Transformer with a kernel inspired by the Taylor expansion of exponential functions, augmented by convolutional networks. Mirroring the Transformer's in-context adeptness, it became a strong contender in the field. In our work, we present a singular, elegant alteration to the Based kernel that amplifies its In-Context Learning abilities evaluated with the Multi-Query Associative Recall task and overall language modeling process, as demonstrated on the Pile dataset.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nDaniel Y.

However, the substantial computational cost of transformers and limited generalization of positional encoding restrict the size of their context window. We introduce Context Expansion with Parallel Encoding (CEPE), a framework that can be applied to any existing decoder-only LLMs to extend their context window. CEPE employs a small encoder to process long inputs chunk by chunk, enabling the frozen decoder to utilize additional contexts via cross-attention. CEPE is efficient, generalizable, and versatile: trained with 8K-token documents, it extends the context window of LLAMA-2 to 128K tokens, offering 10x the throughput with only 1/6 of the memory. CEPE yields strong performance on language modeling and in-context learning. CEPE also excels in retrieval-augmented applications, while existing long-context models degenerate with retrieved contexts. We further introduce a CEPE variant that can extend the context window of instruction-tuned models using only unlabeled data, and showcase its effectiveness on LLAMA-2-CHAT, leading to a strong instruction-following model that can leverage very long contexts on downstream tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/45 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLillicrap. 2020.

Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/40 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nRae, J.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient.

Fourier Transformer: Fast Long Range Modeling by Removing Sequence Redundancy with FFT Operator\n\n*From Search Query: Compressive Transformer Long Sequence*\n\n*Ziwei He, Meng-Da Yang, Minwei Feng, Jingcheng Yin, Xinbing Wang, Jingwen Leng, Zhouhan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** Fourier Transformer is able to significantly reduce computational costs while retain the ability to inherit from various large pretrained models, and achieves state-of-the-art performances among all transformer-based models on the long-range modeling benchmark LRA.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer model is known to be computationally demanding, and prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the self-attention module uses a quadratic time and space complexity with respect to sequence length. Many researchers have focused on designing new forms of self-attention or introducing new parameters to overcome this limitation, however a large portion of them prohibits the model to inherit weights from large pretrained models. In this work, the transformer's inefficiency has been taken care of from another perspective. We propose Fourier Transformer, a simple yet effective approach by progressively removing redundancies in hidden sequence using the ready-made Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) operator to perform Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT). Fourier Transformer is able to significantly reduce computational costs while retain the ability to inherit from various large pretrained models. Experiments show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performances among all transformer-based models on the long-range modeling benchmark LRA with significant improvement in both speed and space. For generative seq-to-seq tasks including CNN/DailyMail and ELI5, by inheriting the BART weights our model outperforms the standard BART and other efficient models. \\footnote{Our code is publicly available at \\url{https://github.com/LUMIA-Group/FourierTransformer}}\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression Transformers*\n\n*Suyu Ge, Yunan Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Minjia Zhang, Jiawei Han, Jianfeng Gao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive KV cache compression is introduced, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs) and demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss.\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 104  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n#### 5. Context Compression for Auto-regressive Transformers with Sentinel Tokens\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression Transformers*\n\n*Siyu Ren, Qi Jia, Kenny Q. Zhu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic complexity of the attention module makes it gradually become the bulk of compute in Transformer-based LLMs during generation. Moreover, the excessive key-value cache that arises when dealing with long inputs also brings severe issues on memory footprint and inference latency. In this work, we propose a plug-and-play approach that is able to incrementally compress the intermediate activation of a specified span of tokens into compact ones, thereby reducing both memory and computational cost when processing subsequent context. Experiments on both in-domain language modeling and zero-shot open-ended document generation demonstrate the advantage of our approach over sparse attention baselines in terms of fluency, n-gram matching, and semantic similarity. At last, we comprehensively profile the benefit of context compression on improving the system throughout.

Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression Transformers*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3.

The Infini-attention incorporates a compressive memory into the vanilla attention mechanism and builds in both masked local attention and long-term linear attention mechanisms in a single Transformer block. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on long-context language modeling benchmarks, 1M sequence length passkey context block retrieval and 500K length book summarization tasks with 1B and 8B LLMs. Our approach introduces minimal bounded memory parameters and enables fast streaming inference for LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression Transformers*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. DNABERT-2: Efficient Foundation Model and Benchmark For Multi-Species Genome\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression Transformers*\n\n*Han Liu, Ramana Davuluri, Pratik Dutta, Weijian Li, Yanrong Ji, Zhihan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Decoding the linguistic intricacies of the genome is a crucial problem in biology, and pre-trained foundational models such as DNABERT and Nucleotide Transformer have made significant strides in this area. Existing works have largely hinged on k-mer, fixed-length permutations of A, T, C, and G, as the token of the genome language due to its simplicity. However, we argue that the computation and sample inefficiencies introduced by k-mer tokenization are primary obstacles in developing large genome foundational models. We provide conceptual and empirical insights into genome tokenization, building on which we propose to replace k-mer tokenization with Byte Pair Encoding (BPE), a statistics-based data compression algorithm that constructs tokens by iteratively merging the most frequent co-occurring genome segment in the corpus. We demonstrate that BPE not only overcomes the limitations of k-mer tokenization but also benefits from the computational efficiency of non-overlapping tokenization. Based on these insights, we introduce DNABERT-2, a refined genome foundation model that adapts an efficient tokenizer and employs multiple strategies to overcome input length constraints, reduce time and memory expenditure, and enhance model capability. Furthermore, we identify the absence of a comprehensive and standardized benchmark for genome understanding as another significant impediment to fair comparative analysis. In response, we propose the Genome Understanding Evaluation (GUE), a comprehensive multi-species genome classification dataset that amalgamates $36$ distinct datasets across $9$ tasks, with input lengths ranging from $70$ to $10000$. Through comprehensive experiments on the GUE benchmark, we demonstrate that DNABERT-2 achieves comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model with $21 \\times$ fewer parameters and approximately $92 \\times$ less GPU time in pre-training.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates hierarchical state space models with transformer architectures, and enhances efficiency and scalability, here are the key insights and most relevant information from the provided sources:\n\n## Integration of Hierarchical State Space Models with Transformers\n\n- The concept of integrating state space models (SSMs) with transformers is well-explored in recent research. For instance, the **Decision Mamba (DM)** and **Hierarchical Decision Mamba (HDM)** models replace traditional Transformer architectures with SSMs, leveraging the linear scalability of SSMs with respect to sequence length.\n- **SC-MAMBA2** integrates SSMs into the Mamba framework, enabling efficient modeling of ultra-long sequences, such as those in single-cell transcriptomics. This approach demonstrates near-linear scalability and preserves comparable modeling abilities to transformers.\n\n## Compressive and Adaptive Memory Techniques\n\n- **Compressive Transformers** introduce a mechanism to compress past hidden activations, allowing the model to scale to longer sequences while retaining important information. This aligns with the proposal's idea of adaptive state compression[Analysis Note, Rae et al.

This design allows for efficient inference, especially for long sequences, and adaptive scaling across compute requirements.\n\n## Hierarchical Processing and Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\n\n- The **Hierarchical Decision Transformer (HDT)** splits the decision-making process into high-level and low-level mechanisms, using sub-goal states to guide the agent. This hierarchical approach can be adapted to language models to capture both local and global dependencies.\n- The use of temporal latent bottlenecks in the proposed **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear** model can be compared to the hierarchical processing in HDT, where each level of the hierarchy handles different scales of dependencies.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **State Space Models (SSMs)** are highlighted for their linear scalability with sequence length, which is a significant advantage over the quadratic scaling of traditional transformers. This makes SSMs particularly suitable for long-sequence modeling.\n- **MatMamba** and **SC-MAMBA2** demonstrate how integrating SSMs with transformer-like architectures can lead to faster inference and better memory performance, especially in scenarios requiring elastic deployment and real-time processing.\n\n## Key References and Next Steps\n\n### Key References\n- **Decision Mamba and Hierarchical Decision Mamba**: These models integrate SSMs with transformer architectures, offering linear scalability and hierarchical processing.\n- **SC-MAMBA2**: This model integrates SSMs into the Mamba framework for efficient modeling of ultra-long sequences, showcasing near-linear scalability.\n- **MatMamba**: Combines Matryoshka Representation Learning with Mamba2's SSM, enabling flexible and adaptive inference for long sequences.\n\n### Next Steps\n\n#### External Searches\n- Search for recent papers (2022-2023) on hierarchical state space models integrated with transformers, focusing on long-sequence modeling and adaptive memory compression.\n- Look for implementations and benchmarks of models like **Compressive Transformers**, **MatMamba**, and **SC-MAMBA2** to understand practical challenges and performance metrics.\n\n#### Internal Library Search\n- Retrieve detailed proposals and reviews of \"compressivehierarchicalttt\" and \"sparsekeyfastttt\" to compare their methodologies with the current proposal.\n- Analyze implementation details, reviews, and ratings to assess the novelty and feasibility of **HierarchicalFastTTTLinear**.\n\n#### Analysis and Synthesis\n- Compile the gathered information to evaluate the novelty and feasibility of the proposed model.\n- Prepare a comprehensive review by consolidating insights from the literature and sibling designs, focusing on how the hierarchical state space model integration and adaptive memory compression can enhance the **FastTTTLinear** architecture.\n\nBy following these steps and leveraging the insights from the referenced works, the researcher can develop a robust and efficient novel autoregressive LM block that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models.\n",

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods. Our code is publicly available.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2401.04081, 2024.

Although the context window can be extended through fine-tuning, it will result in a considerable cost at both training and inference time, and exert an unfavorable impact to the LLM's original capabilities. In this work, we propose a new method called Activation Beacon, which condenses LLM's raw activations into compact forms such that the LLM can perceive a longer context with a limited context window. Activation Beacon is introduced as a plug-in module, which fully preserves the LLM's original capability in short contexts. It works with the sliding window to streamingly process the long context, which leads to a competitive memory and time efficiency in both training and inference. Activation Beacon is trained with short-sequence data of diversified condensing ratios. Thanks to such a treatment, it can be effectively learned to support different context lengths with a small training cost. Our experiment verifies Activation Beacon's effectiveness of context extension: it can remarkably accomplish high-quality extension of Llama-2-7B's context by $\\times100$ times (from 4K to 400K); meanwhile, it can also achieve superior performances across a variety of long-context language modeling and understanding tasks.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Associating Objects with Transformers for Video Object Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Transformers*\n\n*Zongxin Yang, Yunchao Wei, Yi Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding learning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under challenging multi-object scenarios, and proposes an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates how to realize better and more efficient embedding learning to tackle the semi-supervised video object segmentation under challenging multi-object scenarios. The state-of-the-art methods learn to decode features with a single positive object and thus have to match and segment each target separately under multi-object scenarios, consuming multiple times computing resources. To solve the problem, we propose an Associating Objects with Transformers (AOT) approach to match and decode multiple objects uniformly. In detail, AOT employs an identification mechanism to associate multiple targets into the same high-dimensional embedding space. Thus, we can simultaneously process multiple objects' matching and segmentation decoding as efficiently as processing a single object. For sufficiently modeling multi-object association, a Long Short-Term Transformer is designed for constructing hierarchical matching and propagation. We conduct extensive experiments on both multi-object and single-object benchmarks to examine AOT variant networks with different complexities. Particularly, our R50-AOT-L outperforms all the state-of-the-art competitors on three popular benchmarks, i.e., YouTube-VOS (84.1% J&F), DAVIS 2017 (84.9%), and DAVIS 2016 (91.1%), while keeping more than $3\\times$ faster multi-object run-time. Meanwhile, our AOT-T can maintain real-time multi-object speed on the above benchmarks. Based on AOT, we ranked 1st in the 3rd Large-scale VOS Challenge.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 58*)\n\n#### 3.

Bhirangi, Chenyu Wang, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Carmel Majidi, Abhinav Gupta, T. Hellebrekers, Lerrel Pinto*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction that stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy, outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba on MSE.\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

LoCoCo: Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression in LLMs*\n\n*Ruisi Cai, Yuandong Tian, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper tackles the memory hurdle of processing long context sequences in Large Language Models (LLMs), by presenting a novel approach, Dropping In Convolutions for Long Context Compression (LoCoCo). LoCoCo employs only a fixed-size Key-Value (KV) cache, and can enhance efficiency in both inference and fine-tuning stages. Diverging from prior methods that selectively drop KV pairs based on heuristics, LoCoCo leverages a data-driven adaptive fusion technique, blending previous KV pairs with incoming tokens to minimize the loss of contextual information and ensure accurate attention modeling. This token integration is achieved through injecting one-dimensional convolutional kernels that dynamically calculate mixing weights for each KV cache slot. Designed for broad compatibility with existing LLM frameworks, LoCoCo allows for straightforward\"drop-in\"integration without needing architectural modifications, while incurring minimal tuning overhead. Experiments demonstrate that LoCoCo maintains consistently outstanding performance across various context lengths and can achieve a high context compression rate during both inference and fine-tuning phases. During inference, we successfully compressed up to 3482 tokens into a 128-size KV cache, while retaining comparable performance to the full sequence - an accuracy improvement of up to 0.2791 compared to baselines at the same cache size. During post-training tuning, we also effectively extended the context length from 4K to 32K using a KV cache of fixed size 512, achieving performance similar to fine-tuning with entire sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

The proposed attention mechanism exploits a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix (H-Matrix) developed by the numerical analysis community, and has linear run time and memory complexity. We perform extensive experiments to show that the inductive bias embodied by our hierarchical attention is effective in capturing the hierarchical structure in the sequences typical for natural language and vision tasks. Our method is superior to alternative sub-quadratic proposals by over +6 points on average on the Long Range Arena benchmark.

FasterViT combines the benefits of fast local representation learning in CNNs and global modeling properties in ViT. Our newly introduced Hierarchical Attention (HAT) approach decomposes global self-attention with quadratic complexity into a multi-level attention with reduced computational costs. We benefit from efficient window-based self-attention. Each window has access to dedicated carrier tokens that participate in local and global representation learning. At a high level, global self-attentions enable the efficient cross-window communication at lower costs. FasterViT achieves a SOTA Pareto-front in terms of accuracy and image throughput. We have extensively validated its effectiveness on various CV tasks including classification, object detection and segmentation. We also show that HAT can be used as a plug-and-play module for existing networks and enhance them. We further demonstrate significantly faster and more accurate performance than competitive counterparts for images with high resolution.

Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Fast Linear Attention*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1339  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. A ConvNet for the 2020s\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Transformers*\n\n*Saining Xie, Trevor Darrell, Christoph Feichtenhofer, Chao-yuan Wu, Hanzi Mao, Zhuang Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** The \"Roaring 20s\" of visual recognition began with the introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs), which quickly superseded ConvNets as the state-of-the-art image classification model. A vanilla ViT, on the other hand, faces difficulties when applied to general computer vision tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. It is the hierarchical Transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) that reintroduced several ConvNet priors, making Transformers practically viable as a generic vision backbone and demonstrating remarkable performance on a wide variety of vision tasks. However, the effectiveness of such hybrid approaches is still largely credited to the intrinsic superiority of Transformers, rather than the inherent inductive biases of convolutions. In this work, we reexamine the design spaces and test the limits of what a pure ConvNet can achieve. We gradually \"modernize\" a standard ResNet toward the design of a vision Transformer, and discover several key components that contribute to the performance difference along the way. The outcome of this exploration is a family of pure ConvNet models dubbed ConvNeXt. Constructed entirely from standard ConvNet modules, ConvNeXts compete favorably with Transformers in terms of accuracy and scalability, achieving 87.8% ImageNet top-1 accuracy and outperforming Swin Transformers on COCO detection and ADE20K segmentation, while maintaining the simplicity and efficiency of standard ConvNets.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-10\n\n\n\n#### 2. Low-Dimensional Hyperbolic Knowledge Graph Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical State Space Transformers*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Da-Cheng Juan, Ines Chami, Frederic Sala, Adva Wolf, Sujith Ravi*\n\n**Abstract:** Knowledge graph (KG) embeddings learn low-dimensional representations of entities and relations to predict missing facts. KGs often exhibit hierarchical and logical patterns which must be preserved in the embedding space. For hierarchical data, hyperbolic embedding methods have shown promise for high-fidelity and parsimonious representations. However, existing hyperbolic embedding methods do not account for the rich logical patterns in KGs. In this work, we introduce a class of hyperbolic KG embedding models that simultaneously capture hierarchical and logical patterns. Our approach combines hyperbolic reflections and rotations with attention to model complex relational patterns. Experimental results on standard KG benchmarks show that our method improves over previous Euclidean- and hyperbolic-based efforts by up to 6.1% in mean reciprocal rank (MRR) in low dimensions. Furthermore, we observe that different geometric transformations capture different types of relations while attention-based transformations generalize to multiple relations. In high dimensions, our approach yields new state-of-the-art MRRs of 49.6% on WN18RR and 57.7% on YAGO3-10.\n\n**Conference:** low-dimensional-hyperbolic-knowledge-graph\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression in LLMs*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Model Tells You What to Discard: Adaptive KV Cache Compression for LLMs\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Memory Compression in LLMs*\n\n*Jianfeng Gao, Jiawei Han, Minjia Zhang, Liyuan Liu, Yunan Zhang, Suyu Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** In this study, we introduce adaptive KV cache compression, a plug-and-play method that reduces the memory footprint of generative inference for Large Language Models (LLMs). Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-03\n\n\n\n#### 5. Learned Queries for Efficient Local Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Fast Linear Attention*\n\n*Amit H. Bermano, Ariel Shamir, Moab Arar*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViT) serve as powerful vision models. Unlike convolutional neural networks, which dominated vision research in previous years, vision transformers enjoy the ability to capture long-range dependencies in the data. Nonetheless, an integral part of any transformer architecture, the self-attention mechanism, suffers from high latency and inefficient memory utilization, making it less suitable for high-resolution input images. To alleviate these shortcomings, hierarchical vision models locally employ self-attention on non-interleaving windows. This relaxation reduces the complexity to be linear in the input size; however, it limits the cross-window interaction, hurting the model performance. In this paper, we propose a new shift-invariant local attention layer, called query and attend (QnA), that aggregates the input locally in an overlapping manner, much like convolutions. The key idea behind QnA is to introduce learned queries, which allow fast and efficient implementation. We verify the effectiveness of our layer by incorporating it into a hierarchical vision transformer model. We show improvements in speed and memory complexity while achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art models. Finally, our layer scales especially well with window size, requiring up-to x10 less memory while being up-to x5 faster than existing methods.

LouvainNE: Hierarchical Louvain Method for High Quality and Scalable Network Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Fast Linear Attention*\n\n*Bivas Mitra, Jean-Loup Guillaume, Maximilien Danisch, Koushik Meneni, Ayan Kumar Bhowmick*\n\n**Abstract:** Network embedding, that aims to learn low-dimensional vector representation of nodes such that the network structure is preserved,\r\nhas gained significant research attention in recent years. However, most state-of-the-art network embedding methods are computationally expensive and hence unsuitable for representing nodes in billion-scale networks. In this paper, we present LouvainNE, a hierarchical clustering approach to network embedding. Precisely, we employ Louvain, an extremely fast and accurate community detection method, to build a hierarchy of successively smaller subgraphs. We obtain representations of individual nodes in the original graph at different levels of the hierarchy, then we aggregate these representations to learn the final embedding vectors. Our theoretical analysis shows that our proposed algorithm has quasi-linear runtime and memory complexity. Our extensive experimental evaluation, carried out on multiple real-world networks of different scales, demonstrates both (i) the scalability of our proposed approach that can handle graphs containing tens of billions of edges, as well as (ii) its effectiveness in performing downstream network mining tasks such as network reconstruction and node classification.\n\n**Proceeding:** the-thirteenth-acm-international-conference\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model block, such as \"HierarchicalFastTTTLinear,\" that outperforms current state-of-the-art models, here are the key points and useful information from the provided analysis and additional insights:\n\n## Goal and Idea\nThe researcher aims to enhance the existing **FastTTTLinear** model by introducing a hierarchical multi-scale architecture.

The design introduces an efficient parameterization that enables both linear-time computation paths for training and quadratic-time paths for enhanced expressivity when needed. This dual-path approach, combined with memory-efficient test-time adaptation mechanisms, significantly improves model performance while maintaining computational efficiency.",
