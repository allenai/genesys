FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.22)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 32/45 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2006.04768, 2020.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

Latency-aware Spatial-wise Dynamic Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware neural networks*\n\n*Yizeng Han, Zhihang Yuan, Yifan Pu, Chenhao Xue, S. Song, Guangyu Sun, Gao Huang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model that can efficiently estimate the inference latency of dynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties.\n\n**Abstract:** Spatial-wise dynamic convolution has become a promising approach to improving the inference efficiency of deep networks. By allocating more computation to the most informative pixels, such an adaptive inference paradigm reduces the spatial redundancy in image features and saves a considerable amount of unnecessary computation. However, the theoretical efficiency achieved by previous methods can hardly translate into a realistic speedup, especially on the multi-core processors (e.g. GPUs). The key challenge is that the existing literature has only focused on designing algorithms with minimal computation, ignoring the fact that the practical latency can also be influenced by scheduling strategies and hardware properties. To bridge the gap between theoretical computation and practical efficiency, we propose a latency-aware spatial-wise dynamic network (LASNet), which performs coarse-grained spatially adaptive inference under the guidance of a novel latency prediction model. The latency prediction model can efficiently estimate the inference latency of dynamic networks by simultaneously considering algorithms, scheduling strategies, and hardware properties. We use the latency predictor to guide both the algorithm design and the scheduling optimization on various hardware platforms. Experiments on image classification, object detection and instance segmentation demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves the practical inference efficiency of deep networks. For example, the average latency of a ResNet-101 on the ImageNet validation set could be reduced by 36% and 46% on a server GPU (Nvidia Tesla-V100) and an edge device (Nvidia Jetson TX2 GPU) respectively without sacrificing the accuracy.

Vector-Vector-Matrix Architecture: A Novel Hardware-Aware Framework for Low-Latency Inference in NLP Applications\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware neural networks*\n\n*Matthew Khoury, Rumen Dangovski, L. Ou, Preslav Nakov, Yichen Shen, L. Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA) is proposed, which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT and reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become the standard approach to building reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, ranging from Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to dialogue systems. However, improving accuracy by increasing the model size requires a large number of hardware computations, which can slow down NLP applications significantly at inference time. To address this issue, we propose a novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA), which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT. This architecture takes advantage of specialized hardware that has low-latency vector-vector operations and higher-latency vector-matrix operations. It also reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy. We present empirical results suggesting that our framework can reduce the latency of sequence-to-sequence and Transformer models used for NMT by a factor of four. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that our VVMA extends to other domains, and we discuss novel hardware for its efficient use.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Statistical Framework for Low-bitwidth Training of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-aware neural networks*\n\n*Jianfei Chen, Yujie Gai, Z. Yao, Michael W. Mahoney, Joseph E. Gonzalez*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that the FQT gradient is an unbiased estimator of the QAT gradient, and the impact of gradient quantization on its variance is discussed, and two novel gradient quantizers are developed that have smaller variance than the existing per-tensor quantizer.\n\n**Abstract:** Fully quantized training (FQT), which uses low-bitwidth hardware by quantizing the activations, weights, and gradients of a neural network model, is a promising approach to accelerate the training of deep neural networks. One major challenge with FQT is the lack of theoretical understanding, in particular of how gradient quantization impacts convergence properties. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting a statistical framework for analyzing FQT algorithms. We view the quantized gradient of FQT as a stochastic estimator of its full precision counterpart, a procedure known as quantization-aware training (QAT). We show that the FQT gradient is an unbiased estimator of the QAT gradient, and we discuss the impact of gradient quantization on its variance. Inspired by these theoretical results, we develop two novel gradient quantizers, and we show that these have smaller variance than the existing per-tensor quantizer. For training ResNet-50 on ImageNet, our 5-bit block Householder quantizer achieves only 0.5% validation accuracy loss relative to QAT, comparable to the existing INT8 baseline.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Memory-Based Dual Gaussian Processes for Sequential Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory access optimization*\n\n*Paul E. Chang, Prakhar Verma, S. T. John, A. Solin, M. E. Khan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a method to keep all such errors in check using the recently proposed dual sparse variational GP, which enables accurate inference for generic likelihoods and improves learning by actively building and updating a memory of past data.\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential learning with Gaussian processes (GPs) is challenging when access to past data is limited, for example, in continual and active learning. In such cases, errors can accumulate over time due to inaccuracies in the posterior, hyperparameters, and inducing points, making accurate learning challenging. Here, we present a method to keep all such errors in check using the recently proposed dual sparse variational GP. Our method enables accurate inference for generic likelihoods and improves learning by actively building and updating a memory of past data. We demonstrate its effectiveness in several applications involving Bayesian optimization, active learning, and continual learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

Several researchers have recently proposed schemes to parallelize SGD, but all require performance-destroying memory locking and synchronization. This work aims to show using novel theoretical analysis, algorithms, and implementation that SGD can be implemented without any locking. We present an update scheme called HOGWILD! which allows processors access to shared memory with the possibility of overwriting each other's work. We show that when the associated optimization problem is sparse, meaning most gradient updates only modify small parts of the decision variable, then HOGWILD! achieves a nearly optimal rate of convergence. We demonstrate experimentally that HOGWILD! outperforms alternative schemes that use locking by an order of magnitude.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2011\n\n**Citations:** 2222  (*Influential: 256*)\n\n#### 6.

Access to pre-trained models, courtesy of the open-source community, has made it possible to adapt these models to specific applications for enhanced performance. However, the substantial resources required for training these models necessitate efficient solutions. This paper introduces CoLLiE, an efficient library that facilitates collaborative training of large language models using 3D parallelism, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, and optimizers such as Lion, Adan, Sophia, LOMO and AdaLomo. With its modular design and comprehensive functionality, CoLLiE offers a balanced blend of efficiency, ease of use, and customization. CoLLiE has proven superior training efficiency in comparison with prevalent solutions in pre-training and fine-tuning scenarios. Furthermore, we provide an empirical evaluation of the correlation between model size and GPU memory consumption under different optimization methods, as well as an analysis of the throughput. Lastly, we carry out a comprehensive comparison of various optimizers and PEFT methods within the instruction-tuning context.

Constrained deep neural network architecture search for IoT devices accounting hardware calibration\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware co-design*\n\n*F. Scheidegger, L. Benini, C. Bekas, A. Malossi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a unique narrow-space architecture search that focuses on delivering low-cost and rapidly executing networks that respect strict memory and time requirements typical of Internet-of-Things near-sensor computing platforms and presents the first empirical demonstration of more than 3000 trained models that run with reduced precision and push the Pareto optimal front.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks achieve outstanding results for challenging image classification tasks. However, the design of network topologies is a complex task, and the research community is conducting ongoing efforts to discover top-accuracy topologies, either manually or by employing expensive architecture searches. We propose a unique narrow-space architecture search that focuses on delivering low-cost and rapidly executing networks that respect strict memory and time requirements typical of Internet-of-Things (IoT) near-sensor computing platforms. Our approach provides solutions with classification latencies below 10~ms running on a low-cost device with 1~GB RAM and a peak performance of 5.6~GFLOPS. The narrow-space search of floating-point models improves the accuracy on CIFAR10 of an established IoT model from 70.64% to 74.87% within the same memory constraints. We further improve the accuracy to 82.07% by including 16-bit half types and obtain the highest accuracy of 83.45% by extending the search with model-optimized IEEE 754 reduced types. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first empirical demonstration of more than 3000 trained models that run with reduced precision and push the Pareto optimal front by a wide margin. Within a given memory constraint, accuracy is improved by more than 7% points for half and more than 1% points for the best individual model format.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 8. Auto-NBA: Efficient and Effective Search Over the Joint Space of Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware co-design*\n\n*Yonggan Fu, Yongan Zhang, Yang Zhang, David Cox, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators.\n\n**Abstract:** While maximizing deep neural networks' (DNNs') acceleration efficiency requires a joint search/design of three different yet highly coupled aspects, including the networks, bitwidths, and accelerators, the challenges associated with such a joint search have not yet been fully understood and addressed. The key challenges include (1) the dilemma of whether to explode the memory consumption due to the huge joint space or achieve sub-optimal designs, (2) the discrete nature of the accelerator design space that is coupled yet different from that of the networks and bitwidths, and (3) the chicken and egg problem associated with network-accelerator co-search, i.e., co-search requires operation-wise hardware cost, which is lacking during search as the optimal accelerator depending on the whole network is still unknown during search. To tackle these daunting challenges towards optimal and fast development of DNN accelerators, we propose a framework dubbed Auto-NBA to enable jointly searching for the Networks, Bitwidths, and Accelerators, by efficiently localizing the optimal design within the huge joint design space for each target dataset and acceleration specification. Our Auto-NBA integrates a heterogeneous sampling strategy to achieve unbiased search with constant memory consumption, and a novel joint-search pipeline equipped with a generic differentiable accelerator search engine. Extensive experiments and ablation studies validate that both Auto-NBA generated networks and accelerators consistently outperform state-of-the-art designs (including co-search/exploration techniques, hardware-aware NAS methods, and DNN accelerators), in terms of search time, task accuracy, and accelerator efficiency.

On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware co-design*\n\n*Ji Lin, Ligeng Zhu, Wei-Ming Chen, Wei-Chen Wang, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW.\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

Flops or parameters are traditional metrics to evaluate the efficiency of networks which are not sensitive to hardware including computing ability and memory bandwidth. Thus, how to design a neural network to efficiently use the computing ability and memory bandwidth of hardware is a critical problem.

In\nthis work, we introduce SqueezeNext, a new family of neural network\narchitectures whose design was guided by considering previous architectures\nsuch as SqueezeNet, as well as by simulation results on a neural network\naccelerator. This new network is able to match AlexNet's accuracy on the\nImageNet benchmark with $112\\times$ fewer parameters, and one of its deeper\nvariants is able to achieve VGG-19 accuracy with only 4.4 Million parameters,\n($31\\times$ smaller than VGG-19).

Pareto Optimal Compression of Genomic Dictionaries, with or without Random Access in Main Memory\n\n*From Search Query: memory access optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Motivation: A Genomic Dictionary, i.e., the set of the k-mers appearing in a genome, is a fundamental source of genomic information: its collection is the first step in strategic computational methods ranging from assembly to sequence comparison and phylogeny. Unfortunately, it is costly to store. This motivates some recent studies regarding the compression of those k-mer sets. However, such an area does not have the maturity of genomic compression, lacking an homogeneous and methodologically sound experimental foundation that allows to fairly compare the relative merits of the available solutions, and that takes into account also the rich choices of compression methods that can be used. Results: We provide such a foundation here, supporting it with an extensive set of experiments that use reference datasets and a carefully selected set of representative data compressors. Our results highlight the spectrum of compressor choices one has in terms of Pareto Optimality of compression vs. post-processing, this latter being important when the Dictionary needs to be decompressed many times. In addition to the useful indications, not available elsewhere, that this study offers to the researchers interested in storing k-mer dictionaries in compressed form, a software system that can be readily used to explore the Pareto Optimal solutions available r a given Dictionary is also provided.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory access optimization*\n\n*Christopher R\u00e9, Atri Rudra, Stefano Ermon, Daniel Y. Fu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-27\n\n\n\n#### 5. Neural Network-Hardware Co-design for Scalable RRAM-based BNN Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware co-design*\n\n*Jae-Joon Kim, HyungJun Kim, Yulhwa Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, RRAM-based Binary Neural Network (BNN) hardware has been gaining\ninterests as it requires 1-bit sense-amp only and eliminates the need for\nhigh-resolution ADC and DAC. However, RRAM-based BNN hardware still requires\nhigh-resolution ADC for partial sum calculation to implement large-scale neural\nnetwork using multiple memory arrays. We propose a neural network-hardware\nco-design approach to split input to fit each split network on a RRAM array so\nthat the reconstructed BNNs calculate 1-bit output neuron in each array. As a\nresult, ADC can be completely eliminated from the design even for large-scale\nneural network. Simulation results show that the proposed network\nreconstruction and retraining recovers the inference accuracy of the original\nBNN. The accuracy loss of the proposed scheme in the CIFAR-10 testcase was less\nthan 1.1% compared to the original network.

CODEBench: A Neural Architecture and Hardware Accelerator Co-Design Framework\n\n*From Search Query: neural hardware co-design*\n\n*Niraj K. Jha, Ritvik Sharma, Chia-Hao Li, Shikhar Tuli*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, automated co-design of machine learning (ML) models and accelerator architectures has attracted significant attention from both the industry and academia. However, most co-design frameworks either explore a limited search space or employ suboptimal exploration techniques for simultaneous design decision investigations of the ML model and the accelerator. Furthermore, training the ML model and simulating the accelerator performance is computationally expensive. To address these limitations, this work proposes a novel neural architecture and hardware accelerator co-design framework, called CODEBench. It is composed of two new benchmarking sub-frameworks, CNNBench and AccelBench, which explore expanded design spaces of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and CNN accelerators. CNNBench leverages an advanced search technique, BOSHNAS, to efficiently train a neural heteroscedastic surrogate model to converge to an optimal CNN architecture by employing second-order gradients. AccelBench performs cycle-accurate simulations for a diverse set of accelerator architectures in a vast design space. With the proposed co-design method, called BOSHCODE, our best CNN-accelerator pair achieves 1.4% higher accuracy on the CIFAR-10 dataset compared to the state-of-the-art pair, while enabling 59.1% lower latency and 60.8% lower energy consumption. On the ImageNet dataset, it achieves 3.7% higher Top1 accuracy at 43.8% lower latency and 11.2% lower energy consumption. CODEBench outperforms the state-of-the-art framework, i.e., Auto-NBA, by achieving 1.5% higher accuracy and 34.7x higher throughput, while enabling 11.0x lower energy-delay product (EDP) and 4.0x lower chip area on CIFAR-10.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware efficiency, here are some key findings and innovations from the provided sources that align with your requirements:\n\n## Recent Innovations in Hardware-Aware Neural Network Design\n\n- The Tokyo University of Science has developed a novel training algorithm for binarized neural networks (BNNs) using ternary gradients, known as the ternarized gradient BNN (TGBNN). This approach is implemented in a computing-in-memory (CiM) architecture using Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM), which significantly reduces circuit size and power consumption. This design achieves high accuracy and faster training times, making it suitable for edge IoT devices.\n\n## Novel Memory Access Patterns and Optimization Techniques\n\n- The CiM architecture developed by the Tokyo University of Science team performs calculations directly in memory, rather than in a dedicated processor. This approach saves circuit space and power by leveraging MRAM cells and a new XNOR logic gate. This design optimizes memory access patterns by reducing the need for data transfer between memory and processors, leading to lower latency and power consumption.\n\n## Successful Examples of Hardware-Neural Co-Design\n\n- The study on dynamic power control in hardware neural networks highlights the co-design of hardware and neural networks. It proposes an MLP neural network with approximate MAC units implemented in 45nm CMOS technology. This design optimizes power consumption and area usage by incorporating error and power controllable approximate multipliers, demonstrating a 13.33% improvement in power consumption with minimal accuracy loss.\n\n- Hardware-aware pruning techniques are another example of successful co-design. These techniques exploit the unique characteristics of target hardware, such as FPGAs, to optimize CNNs. Custom pruning algorithms and dynamic sparsity allow the model to adaptively adjust the sparsity of weights during inference, optimizing resource usage and reducing latency. This approach has shown a 45% improvement in inference time compared to standard methods.\n\n## Performance Improvements Through Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n- The use of MRAM-based CiM architecture in TGBNNs not only reduces power consumption but also achieves faster convergence during training and maintains high accuracy. This is a significant performance improvement, especially for resource-constrained IoT edge devices.\n\n- Hardware-aware pruning techniques also lead to substantial performance improvements. By reducing the number of parameters and computations, these techniques enable faster inference times and lower energy consumption, making them ideal for IoT applications.\n\n- The optimized hardware design for MLP neural networks, using approximate computing techniques, results in substantial power savings (22.90% per neuron) and a reduction in critical path delay, area, and overall hardware efficiency. This is particularly beneficial for larger neural network architectures and real-time applications.\n\nThese innovations and techniques can be leveraged to improve the hardware efficiency of autoregressive language models like FastTTTLinear, focusing on optimized memory access patterns, co-design of hardware and neural networks, and hardware-specific optimizations to enhance performance and efficiency.\n",

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

Landmark Attention: Random-Access Infinite Context Length for Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.28)\n\n*Amirkeivan Mohtashami, Martin Jaggi*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 86  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have shown remarkable success in natural language processing, their attention mechanism's large memory requirements have limited their ability to handle longer contexts. Prior approaches, such as recurrent memory or retrieval-based augmentation, have either compromised the random-access flexibility of attention (i.e., the capability to select any token in the entire context) or relied on separate mechanisms for relevant context retrieval, which may not be compatible with the model's attention. In this paper, we present a novel approach that allows access to the complete context while retaining random-access flexibility, closely resembling running attention on the entire context. Our method uses a landmark token to represent each block of the input and trains the attention to use it for selecting relevant blocks, enabling retrieval of blocks directly through the attention mechanism instead of by relying on a separate mechanism. Our approach seamlessly integrates with specialized data structures and the system's memory hierarchy, enabling processing of arbitrarily long context lengths. We demonstrate that our method can obtain comparable performance with Transformer-XL while significantly reducing the number of retrieved tokens in each step. Finally, we show that fine-tuning LLaMA 7B with our method successfully extends its context length capacity to over 32k tokens, allowing for inference at the context lengths of GPT-4. We release the implementation of landmark attention and the code to reproduce our experiments at https://github.com/epfml/landmark-attention/.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/32 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nURL https://arxiv.org/abs/ 2212.10554 .

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/46 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nbioRxiv, pages 2022-11, 2022.

Fung, Yin Li, Vikas Singh*\n\n**Published in:** AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence (2021)\t**Cited by** 375  (*Influential: 62*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length and performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as a powerful tool for a broad range of natural language processing tasks. A key component that drives the impressive performance of Transformers is the self-attention mechanism that encodes the influence or dependence of other tokens on each specific token. While beneficial, the quadratic complexity of self-attention on the input sequence length has limited its application to longer sequences - a topic being actively studied in the community. To address this limitation, we propose Nystr\u00f6mformer - a model that exhibits favorable scalability as a function of sequence length. Our idea is based on adapting the Nystr\u00f6m method to approximate standard self-attention with O(n) complexity. The scalability of Nystr\u00f6mformer enables application to longer sequences with thousands of tokens. We perform evaluations on multiple downstream tasks on the GLUE benchmark and IMDB reviews with standard sequence length, and find that our Nystr\u00f6mformer performs comparably, or in a few cases, even slightly better, than standard self-attention. On longer sequence tasks in the Long Range Arena (LRA) benchmark, Nystr\u00f6mformer performs favorably relative to other efficient self-attention methods.

Harmonizing the object recognition strategies of deep neural networks with humans\n\n*From Search Query: tiling strategies neural networks*\n\n*Thomas Fel, Ivan Felipe, Drew Linsley, Thomas Serre*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work represents the first demonstration that the scaling laws that are guiding the design of DNNs today have also produced worse models of human vision, and releases the neural harmonizer: a general-purpose training routine that both aligns DNN and human visual strategies and improves categorization accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** The many successes of deep neural networks (DNNs) over the past decade have largely been driven by computational scale rather than insights from biological intelligence. Here, we explore if these trends have also carried concomitant improvements in explaining the visual strategies humans rely on for object recognition. We do this by comparing two related but distinct properties of visual strategies in humans and DNNs: where they believe important visual features are in images and how they use those features to categorize objects. Across 84 different DNNs trained on ImageNet and three independent datasets measuring the where and the how of human visual strategies for object recognition on those images, we find a systematic trade-off between DNN categorization accuracy and alignment with human visual strategies for object recognition. State-of-the-art DNNs are progressively becoming less aligned with humans as their accuracy improves. We rectify this growing issue with our neural harmonizer: a general-purpose training routine that both aligns DNN and human visual strategies and improves categorization accuracy. Our work represents the first demonstration that the scaling laws [1-3] that are guiding the design of DNNs today have also produced worse models of human vision. We release our code and data at https://serre-lab.github.io/Harmonization to help the field build more human-like DNNs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 58  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Strategies for Pre-training Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: tiling strategies neural networks*\n\n*Weihua Hu, Bowen Liu, Joseph Gomes, M. Zitnik, Percy Liang, V. Pande, J. Leskovec*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for molecular property prediction and protein function prediction.\n\n**Abstract:** Many applications of machine learning require a model to make accurate pre-dictions on test examples that are distributionally different from training ones, while task-specific labels are scarce during training. An effective approach to this challenge is to pre-train a model on related tasks where data is abundant, and then fine-tune it on a downstream task of interest. While pre-training has been effective in many language and vision domains, it remains an open question how to effectively use pre-training on graph datasets. In this paper, we develop a new strategy and self-supervised methods for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). The key to the success of our strategy is to pre-train an expressive GNN at the level of individual nodes as well as entire graphs so that the GNN can learn useful local and global representations simultaneously. We systematically study pre-training on multiple graph classification datasets. We find that naive strategies, which pre-train GNNs at the level of either entire graphs or individual nodes, give limited improvement and can even lead to negative transfer on many downstream tasks. In contrast, our strategy avoids negative transfer and improves generalization significantly across downstream tasks, leading up to 9.4% absolute improvements in ROC-AUC over non-pre-trained models and achieving state-of-the-art performance for molecular property prediction and protein function prediction.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1198  (*Influential: 230*)\n\n#### 3. Are Defenses for Graph Neural Networks Robust?\n\n*From Search Query: tiling strategies neural networks*\n\n*Felix Mujkanovic, Simon Geisler, Stephan Gunnemann, Aleksandar Bojchevski*\n\n**TL;DR:** A thorough robustness analysis of 7 of the most popular defenses spanning the entire spectrum of strategies, i.e., aimed at improving the graph, the architecture, or the training, finds most defenses show no or only marginal improvement compared to an undefended baseline.\n\n**Abstract:** A cursory reading of the literature suggests that we have made a lot of progress in designing effective adversarial defenses for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Yet, the standard methodology has a serious flaw - virtually all of the defenses are evaluated against non-adaptive attacks leading to overly optimistic robustness estimates. We perform a thorough robustness analysis of 7 of the most popular defenses spanning the entire spectrum of strategies, i.e., aimed at improving the graph, the architecture, or the training. The results are sobering - most defenses show no or only marginal improvement compared to an undefended baseline. We advocate using custom adaptive attacks as a gold standard and we outline the lessons we learned from successfully designing such attacks. Moreover, our diverse collection of perturbed graphs forms a (black-box) unit test offering a first glance at a model's robustness.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 4. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models. The code is accessible at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization*\n\n*Yang Luo, Xiaozhe Ren, Zangwei Zheng, Zhuo Jiang, Xin Jiang, Yang You*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes CAME, a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers and proposes it to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer. The implementation of CAME is publicly available.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Memory-Constrained Algorithms for Convex Optimization via Recursive Cutting-Planes\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization*\n\n*Moise Blanchard, Junhui Zhang, P. Jaillet*\n\n**TL;DR:** This is the first class of algorithms that provides a positive trade-off between gradient descent and cutting-plane methods in any regime with $\\epsilon\\leq 1/\\sqrt d$ and achieves the information-theoretic optimal memory usage and improves the oracle-complexity of gradient descent.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a family of recursive cutting-plane algorithms to solve feasibility problems with constrained memory, which can also be used for first-order convex optimization. Precisely, in order to find a point within a ball of radius $\\epsilon$ with a separation oracle in dimension $d$ -- or to minimize $1$-Lipschitz convex functions to accuracy $\\epsilon$ over the unit ball -- our algorithms use $\\mathcal O(\\frac{d^2}{p}\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})$ bits of memory, and make $\\mathcal O((C\\frac{d}{p}\\ln \\frac{1}{\\epsilon})^p)$ oracle calls, for some universal constant $C \\geq 1$. The family is parametrized by $p\\in[d]$ and provides an oracle-complexity/memory trade-off in the sub-polynomial regime $\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}\\gg\\ln d$. While several works gave lower-bound trade-offs (impossibility results) -- we explicit here their dependence with $\\ln\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}$, showing that these also hold in any sub-polynomial regime -- to the best of our knowledge this is the first class of algorithms that provides a positive trade-off between gradient descent and cutting-plane methods in any regime with $\\epsilon\\leq 1/\\sqrt d$. The algorithms divide the $d$ variables into $p$ blocks and optimize over blocks sequentially, with approximate separation vectors constructed using a variant of Vaidya's method. In the regime $\\epsilon \\leq d^{-\\Omega(d)}$, our algorithm with $p=d$ achieves the information-theoretic optimal memory usage and improves the oracle-complexity of gradient descent.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao Embedding: Logical Query Embeddings with Local Comparison and Global Transport\n\n*From Search Query: block-based linear computation*\n\n*Zihao Wang, WeiZhi Fei, Hang Yin, Yangqiu Song, Ginny Y. Wong, S. See*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the local and global trade-off with unbalanced optimal transport theory and embeds sets as bounded measures in $\\real$ endowed with a scoring function motivated by the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric.\n\n**Abstract:** Answering complex queries on knowledge graphs is important but particularly challenging because of the data incompleteness. Query embedding methods address this issue by learning-based models and simulating logical reasoning with set operators. Previous works focus on specific forms of embeddings, but scoring functions between embeddings are underexplored. In contrast to existing scoring functions motivated by local comparison or global transport, this work investigates the local and global trade-off with unbalanced optimal transport theory. Specifically, we embed sets as bounded measures in $\\real$ endowed with a scoring function motivated by the Wasserstein-Fisher-Rao metric. Such a design also facilitates closed-form set operators in the embedding space. Moreover, we introduce a convolution-based algorithm for linear time computation and a block-diagonal kernel to enforce the trade-off. Results show that WFRE can outperform existing query embedding methods on standard datasets, evaluation sets with combinatorially complex queries, and hierarchical knowledge graphs. Ablation study shows that finding a better local and global trade-off is essential for performance improvement.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. A Dual Augmented Block Minimization Framework for Learning with Limited Memory\n\n*From Search Query: block-based linear computation*\n\n*I. E. Yen, Shan-Wei Lin, Shou-De Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper generalizes the existing block minimization framework based on strong duality and Augmented Lagrangian technique to achieve global convergence for general convex ERM when data cannot fit into memory.\n\n**Abstract:** In past few years, several techniques have been proposed for training of linear Support Vector Machine (SVM) in limited-memory setting, where a dual block-coordinate descent (dual-BCD) method was used to balance cost spent on I/O and computation. In this paper, we consider the more general setting of regularized Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) when data cannot fit into memory. In particular, we generalize the existing block minimization framework based on strong duality and Augmented Lagrangian technique to achieve global convergence for general convex ERM. The block minimization framework is flexible in the sense that, given a solver working under sufficient memory, one can integrate it with the framework to obtain a solver globally convergent under limited-memory condition. We conduct experiments on L1-regularized classification and regression problems to corroborate our convergence theory and compare the proposed framework to algorithms adopted from online and distributed settings, which shows superiority of the proposed approach on data of size ten times larger than the memory capacity.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Multi-slots Online Matching with High Entropy\n\n*From Search Query: block-based linear computation*\n\n*Xingyu Lu, Qintong Wu, Leon Wenliang Zhong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel algorithm named Online subGradient descent for Multi-slots Allocation (OG-MA), which uses an efficient pooling algorithm to compute closed-form of the gradient then performs a roulette swap-ping for allocation, yielding a sub-linear regret with linear cost per iteration.\n\n**Abstract:** Online matching with diversity and fairness pursuit, a common building block in the recommendation and advertising, can be modeled as constrained convex programming with high entropy. While most existing approaches are based on the \u201csingle slot\u201d assumption (i.e., assigning one item per iteration), they cannot be directly applied to cases with multiple slots, e.g., stock-aware top-N recommendation and advertising at multiple places. Particularly, the gradient computation and resource allocation are both challenging under this setting due to the absence of a closed-form solu-tion. To overcome these obstacles, we develop a novel algorithm named Online subGradient descent for Multi-slots Allocation (OG-MA). It uses an efficient pooling algorithm to compute closed-form of the gradient then performs a roulette swap-ping for allocation, yielding a sub-linear regret with linear cost per iteration. Extensive experiments on synthetic and industrial data sets demonstrate that OG-MA is a fast and promising method for multi-slots online matching.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 5 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

We present a novel composition of loop tiling and fusion in this paper. Unlike existing tiling-after-fusion algorithms that only transform computation spaces, our approach first applies rectangular/parallelogram tiling to live-out computation spaces for fitting the memory hierarchy, followed by the computation of the memory footprints required by each tile. The upwards exposed data extracted from the memory footprints are used to determine the tile shapes of intermediate computation spaces, allowing the construction of arbitrary tile shapes. Finally, our technique implements a post-tiling fusion strategy for maximizing data locality without losing tilability or parallelism of live-out computation spaces, thereby enabling storage reduction and reuse, and optimizing the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior performance on both CPU and GPU architectures over the state of the art by experimenting on 11 benchmarks extracted from numerous domains including neural networks, image processing, sparse matrix computation and linear algebra. Also, the results of the ResNet-50 model on an AI accelerator show that our approach can obtain 16% performance improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** 53rd-annual-ieee-acm-international-symposium\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. FlashAttention-2: Faster Attention with Better Parallelism and Work Partitioning\n\n*From Search Query: memory hierarchy optimization*\n\n*Tri Dao*\n\n**Abstract:** Scaling Transformers to longer sequence lengths has been a major problem in the last several years, promising to improve performance in language modeling and high-resolution image understanding, as well as to unlock new applications in code, audio, and video generation. The attention layer is the main bottleneck in scaling to longer sequences, as its runtime and memory increase quadratically in the sequence length. FlashAttention exploits the asymmetric GPU memory hierarchy to bring significant memory saving (linear instead of quadratic) and runtime speedup (2-4$\\times$ compared to optimized baselines), with no approximation. However, FlashAttention is still not nearly as fast as optimized matrix-multiply (GEMM) operations, reaching only 25-40\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s. We observe that the inefficiency is due to suboptimal work partitioning between different thread blocks and warps on the GPU, causing either low-occupancy or unnecessary shared memory reads/writes. We propose FlashAttention-2, with better work partitioning to address these issues. In particular, we (1) tweak the algorithm to reduce the number of non-matmul FLOPs (2) parallelize the attention computation, even for a single head, across different thread blocks to increase occupancy, and (3) within each thread block, distribute the work between warps to reduce communication through shared memory. These yield around 2$\\times$ speedup compared to FlashAttention, reaching 50-73\\% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on A100 and getting close to the efficiency of GEMM operations. We empirically validate that when used end-to-end to train GPT-style models, FlashAttention-2 reaches training speed of up to 225 TFLOPs/s per A100 GPU (72\\% model FLOPs utilization).\n\n**Published:** 2023-07-17\n\n\n\n#### 4. Transformer in Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: block-based linear computation*\n\n*Yunhe Wang, Chunjing Xu, Jianyuan Guo, Enhua Wu, An Xiao, Kai Han*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer is a new kind of neural architecture which encodes the input data as powerful features via the attention mechanism. Basically, the visual transformers first divide the input images into several local patches and then calculate both representations and their relationship. Since natural images are of high complexity with abundant detail and color information, the granularity of the patch dividing is not fine enough for excavating features of objects in different scales and locations. In this paper, we point out that the attention inside these local patches are also essential for building visual transformers with high performance and we explore a new architecture, namely, Transformer iN Transformer (TNT). Specifically, we regard the local patches (e.g., 16$\\times$16) as \"visual sentences\" and present to further divide them into smaller patches (e.g., 4$\\times$4) as \"visual words\". The attention of each word will be calculated with other words in the given visual sentence with negligible computational costs. Features of both words and sentences will be aggregated to enhance the representation ability. Experiments on several benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TNT architecture, e.g., we achieve an 81.5% top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet, which is about 1.7% higher than that of the state-of-the-art visual transformer with similar computational cost.

Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: block-based linear computation*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-01\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient tiling strategies, memory hierarchy optimization, and block-based matrix multiplication optimizations, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources:\n\n## Efficient Tiling Strategies for Linear Layers\n\n### Multi-Level Tiling\nThe multi-level tiling strategy described in the context of contrastive learning can be adapted for linear layers in neural networks. This approach involves dividing computations into coarse-grained cross-GPU tiles and fine-grained in-GPU tiles. This method reduces memory overhead by avoiding the full materialization of large matrices, such as the similarity matrix in contrastive learning, and can be applied to other matrix operations in neural networks.\n\n### FlashAttention\nFlashAttention uses a tiling technique to compute attention in neural networks efficiently. By dividing large matrices into smaller blocks (tiles), it reduces memory usage and computational complexity. This approach can be generalized to other linear layers, ensuring that only a subset of the matrix is computed and stored at any given time, thus optimizing memory access patterns.\n\n## Memory Hierarchy Optimization Techniques\n\n### Optimizing Memory Access\nFlashAttention's IO-aware approach is particularly relevant here. It minimizes memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, reducing the number of HBM accesses. This strategy can be applied to optimize memory access patterns in linear layers, ensuring efficient use of the memory hierarchy.\n\n### Register and Cache Tiling\nOrganizing data to fit into vector registers and utilizing cache tiling can help minimize memory access and maximize computational throughput. This is especially important for linear layers that rely heavily on matrix multiplication operations. By aligning data with the memory hierarchy, the model can achieve better performance and efficiency.\n\n## Block-Based Matrix Multiplication Optimizations\n\n### Tiling and Recomputation\nFlashAttention's tiling and recomputation techniques can be applied to block-based matrix multiplication. Tiling involves computing attention over smaller blocks rather than entire matrices, reducing memory usage. Recomputation during the backward pass avoids storing large intermediate matrices, further enhancing memory efficiency and computational resource utilization.\n\n### SwiftFormer's Efficient Additive Attention\nSwiftFormer introduces an efficient additive attention mechanism that replaces traditional quadratic matrix multiplication operations with linear element-wise multiplications. This approach can be adapted for other linear layers to enhance computational efficiency while maintaining accuracy. By focusing on linear operations, it reduces the computational complexity and memory requirements associated with quadratic operations.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations\n\n### Hardware-Neural Co-Design\nIncorporating hardware characteristics into the design process is crucial. For example, LASNet's approach to spatially adaptive inference under the guidance of a latency prediction model can be applied to optimize linear layers for specific hardware architectures. This ensures that the design is tailored to the memory hierarchy and computational constraints of the target hardware.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient autoregressive language models that optimize memory access, reduce computational complexity, and leverage hardware-specific optimizations to achieve better performance and scalability.\n",

Monarch Mixer: A Simple Sub-Quadratic GEMM-Based Architecture (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Simran Arora, Jessica Grogan, Isys Johnson, Sabri Eyuboglu, Armin W.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/67 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n0}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 6}$ | $\\mathbf{9 . 0}$ | Attention-Free, MLP-Free |\n\n## 6 Related Work\n\nLong Convolutions Recent work proposes to use long convolution layers as a replacement for the Transformer attention layers in sequence modeling [26,63, 66-68]. Many of these models rely on the FFT convolution theorem to compute the long convolutions. We build on the insights in many of these architectures in constructing our M2 architectures, and additionally replaces the FFT operations with Monarch matrices. Our work is also related to a rich literature in convolutions in other bases, such as Chebyshev bases [79] or orthogonal polynomial bases [32]. These approaches have analogues in our multivariate analysis; replacing the basis polynomials of the Monarch matrices in Monarch Mixer may be able to approximate some of these operations. An interesting question for future work would be to study how well our techniques and concerns about causality and hardware utilization translate to these alternative convolution bases. Optimization of deep learning primitives There is a rich history of the optimization of deep learning primitives, as accelerating their performance can yield substantial savings in compute and cost for large models. There are many approaches to speed up these operations, but they usually either reduce data movement or compute. Reducing data movement: In many applications, the major bottleneck is the storage and movement of large amounts of memory. One popular approach to reducing data movement is checkpointing, wherein one stores fewer intermediate results and recomputes the others on-the-fly where they are needed, trading additional compute for memory $[44,76]$. Another approach is kernel fusion, wherein algorithms initially described as sequential steps can often be fused in ways that improve their properties. For example, it is generally faster to implement a dot-product through a multiply-accumulate rather than first multiplying and then accumulating. Recently, libraries such as PyTorch 2.0 [62] have added kernel fusion capabilities, although the very best performance usually still arises from\nhandwritten kernels. Third, in order to better exploit memory locality, it is often fastest to load small blocks of memory, do intensive computation on them, and then write the results a tile at a time [80]. Finally, many algorithms also have hand-optimizations that can remove unnecessary computation or memory accesses [53]. Efficient algorithms usually make use of a combination of these techniques. For example, FlashAttention [13] uses all four to dramatically decrease both the latency and memory consumption of multi-head attention. Though we have made a modest effort to implement Monarch Mixer efficiently, we think it likely that Monarch Mixer could be further optimized by these techniques. Reducing flops: A first target for optimization is the multi-layer perceptron (MLP), owing to its ubiquity. A variety of structured sparse factorizations exist, many of which we draw on in this work $[5,9,12,14,15,17,24,88]$. Attention is also a popular target for optimization. Recently, a plethora of sub-quadratic approximations of attention have emerged, that aim to approximate attention to reduce its quadratic complexity. Some methods rely on sparsification, relying on the fact that the attention matrix is extremely sparse at long sequence lengths [2, 21, 22, 40, 51]. Others use low-rank approximations of the attention matrix [11, 77, 88] or kernel methods instead [7, 39]. A subset use a combination of these techniques, such as $[6,71]$. Finally, a third category of methods $[25,63]$ aim to replace attention entirely, relying on state-space models [31]. ## 7 Discussion and Conclusion\n\nWe explore Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that is sub-quadratic in both sequence length and model dimension and is hardware-efficient on modern accelerators. We motivate M2 from both theoretical and systems performance perspectives and conduct a preliminary proof-of-concept investigation into performance on masked language modeling, image classification, and causal language modeling. While our initial results are promising, our work is only a first step in this direction. The M2 layer can likely be further optimized with systems optimization techniques such as kernel fusion. Our work has also not been optimized for inference like more well-established models such as Transformers, or even more recent models such as state space models. It also remains to be seen whether M2 layers can have as widespread applicability as Transformers. We hope that these can be fruitful directions for future work. ## Acknowledgments\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the support of DARPA under Nos.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective.

Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.29)\n\n*Rui-Jie Zhu, Yu Zhang, Ethan Sifferman, Tyler Sheaves, Yiqiao Wang, Dustin Richmond, Peng Zhou, J. Eshraghian*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales and points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Matrix multiplication (MatMul) typically dominates the overall computational cost of large language models (LLMs). This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/27 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nWe assume a constant clock rate for all implementations. We note that the FPGA implementation is done in RTL from top to bottom, and there are many optimizations that could be added. For example, we are not using any vendor-provided IPs, and we are not bursting DDR transactions, both of which would significantly accelerate operation. This approach is to achieve the most generic and cross-platform evaluation possible. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of the first scalable MatMul-free language model. Our work challenges the paradigm that MatMul operations are indispensable for building high-performing language models and paves the way for the development of more efficient and hardware-friendly architectures. We achieve performance on par with state-of-the-art Transformers while eliminating the need for MatMul operations, with an optimized implementation that significantly enhances both training and inference efficiency, reducing both memory usage and latency. As the demand for deploying language models on various platforms grows, MatMul-free LMs present a promising direction for creating models that are both effective and resource-efficient. However, one limitation of our work is that the MatMul-free LM has not been tested on extremely large-scale models (e.g., 100B+ parameters) due to computational constraints. This work serves as a call to action for institutions and organizations that have the resources to build the largest language models to invest in accelerating lightweight models. By prioritizing the development and deployment of MatMul-free architectures such as this one, the future of LLMs will only become more accessible, efficient, and sustainable. ## References\n\n[1] Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Ring Attention with Blockwise Transformers (Ring Attention), which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/23 (Score: 0.18)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 2023.

ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear layers*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Slalom: Fast, Verifiable and Private Execution of Neural Networks in Trusted Hardware\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear layers*\n\n*Florian Tram\u00e8r, D. Boneh*\n\n**TL;DR:** Slalom is proposed, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor, for high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks in TEEs.\n\n**Abstract:** As Machine Learning (ML) gets applied to security-critical or sensitive domains, there is a growing need for integrity and privacy for outsourced ML computations. A pragmatic solution comes from Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which use hardware and software protections to isolate sensitive computations from the untrusted software stack. However, these isolation guarantees come at a price in performance, compared to untrusted alternatives. This paper initiates the study of high performance execution of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in TEEs by efficiently partitioning DNN computations between trusted and untrusted devices. Building upon an efficient outsourcing scheme for matrix multiplication, we propose Slalom, a framework that securely delegates execution of all linear layers in a DNN from a TEE (e.g., Intel SGX or Sanctum) to a faster, yet untrusted, co-located processor. We evaluate Slalom by running DNNs in an Intel SGX enclave, which selectively delegates work to an untrusted GPU. For canonical DNNs (VGG16, MobileNet and ResNet variants) we obtain 6x to 20x increases in throughput for verifiable inference, and 4x to 11x for verifiable and private inference.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 366  (*Influential: 38*)\n\n#### 3. MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear layers*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Coordinate-descent for learning orthogonal matrices through Givens rotations\n\n*From Search Query: matrix operation optimization*\n\n*Uri Shalit, Gal Chechik*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework for optimizing orthogonal matrices, that is the parallel of coordinate-descent in Euclidean spaces, based on Givens-rotations, a fast-to-compute operation that affects a small number of entries in the learned matrix, and preserves orthogonality is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing over the set of orthogonal matrices is a central component in problems like sparse-PCA or tensor decomposition. Unfortunately, such optimization is hard since simple operations on orthogonal matrices easily break orthogonality, and correcting orthogonality usually costs a large amount of computation. \n \nHere we propose a framework for optimizing orthogonal matrices, that is the parallel of coordinate-descent in Euclidean spaces. It is based on Givens-rotations, a fast-to-compute operation that affects a small number of entries in the learned matrix, and preserves orthogonality. \n \nWe show two applications of this approach: an algorithm for tensor decompositions used in learning mixture models, and an algorithm for sparse-PCA. We study the parameter regime where a Givens rotation approach converges faster and achieves a superior model on a genome-wide brain-wide mRNA expression dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2014\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Algorithmic Regularization in Tensor Optimization: Towards a Lifted Approach in Matrix Sensing\n\n*From Search Query: matrix operation optimization*\n\n*Ziye Ma, J. Lavaei, S. Sojoudi*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work examines the role of GD in inducing implicit regularization for tensor optimization, particularly within the context of the lifted matrix sensing framework, and shows that, with sufficiently small initialization scale, GD applied to this lifted problem results in approximate rank-1 tensors and critical points with escape directions.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient descent (GD) is crucial for generalization in machine learning models, as it induces implicit regularization, promoting compact representations. In this work, we examine the role of GD in inducing implicit regularization for tensor optimization, particularly within the context of the lifted matrix sensing framework. This framework has been recently proposed to address the non-convex matrix sensing problem by transforming spurious solutions into strict saddles when optimizing over symmetric, rank-1 tensors. We show that, with sufficiently small initialization scale, GD applied to this lifted problem results in approximate rank-1 tensors and critical points with escape directions. Our findings underscore the significance of the tensor parametrization of matrix sensing, in combination with first-order methods, in achieving global optimality in such problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

Wenliang, Elliot Catt, Marcus Hutter, S. Legg, Pedro A. Ortega*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs, including negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Reliable generalization lies at the heart of safe ML and AI. However, understanding when and how neural networks generalize remains one of the most important unsolved problems in the field. In this work, we conduct an extensive empirical study (20'910 models, 15 tasks) to investigate whether insights from the theory of computation can predict the limits of neural network generalization in practice. We demonstrate that grouping tasks according to the Chomsky hierarchy allows us to forecast whether certain architectures will be able to generalize to out-of-distribution inputs. This includes negative results where even extensive amounts of data and training time never lead to any non-trivial generalization, despite models having sufficient capacity to fit the training data perfectly. Our results show that, for our subset of tasks, RNNs and Transformers fail to generalize on non-regular tasks, LSTMs can solve regular and counter-language tasks, and only networks augmented with structured memory (such as a stack or memory tape) can successfully generalize on context-free and context-sensitive tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 100  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 8. Aligning Transformers with Weisfeiler-Leman\n\n*From Search Query: neural network memory hierarchy*\n\n*Luis M\u00fcller, Christopher Morris*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work advances the alignment of transformers with the WL hierarchy, showing stronger expressivity results for each $k, making them more feasible in practice and develops a theoretical framework that allows the study of established positional encodings such as Laplacian PEs and SPE.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural network architectures aligned with the $k$-dimensional Weisfeiler--Leman ($k$-WL) hierarchy offer theoretically well-understood expressive power. However, these architectures often fail to deliver state-of-the-art predictive performance on real-world graphs, limiting their practical utility. While recent works aligning graph transformer architectures with the $k$-WL hierarchy have shown promising empirical results, employing transformers for higher orders of $k$ remains challenging due to a prohibitive runtime and memory complexity of self-attention as well as impractical architectural assumptions, such as an infeasible number of attention heads. Here, we advance the alignment of transformers with the $k$-WL hierarchy, showing stronger expressivity results for each $k$, making them more feasible in practice. In addition, we develop a theoretical framework that allows the study of established positional encodings such as Laplacian PEs and SPE. We evaluate our transformers on the large-scale PCQM4Mv2 dataset, showing competitive predictive performance with the state-of-the-art and demonstrating strong downstream performance when fine-tuning them on small-scale molecular datasets.

Satheesh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces a new technique for mapping Deep Recurrent Neural Networks efficiently onto GPUs that uses persistent computational kernels that exploit the GPU's inverted memory hierarchy to reuse network weights over multiple timesteps.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a new technique for mapping Deep Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) efficiently onto GPUs. We show how it is possible to achieve substantially higher computational throughput at low mini-batch sizes than direct implementations of RNNs based on matrix multiplications. The key to our approach is the use of persistent computational kernels that exploit the GPU's inverted memory hierarchy to reuse network weights over multiple timesteps. Our initial implementation sustains 2.8 TFLOP/s at a mini-batch size of 4 on an NVIDIA TitanX GPU. This provides a 16\u00d7 reduction in activation memory footprint, enables model training with 12\u00d7 more parameters on the same hardware, allows us to strongly scale RNN training to 128 GPUs, and allows us to efficiently explore end-to-end speech recognition models with over 100 layers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2016\n\n**Citations:** 92  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Ristretto: Hardware-Oriented Approximation of Convolutional Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear layers*\n\n*Philipp Gysel*\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved major breakthroughs in\nrecent years. Their performance in computer vision have matched and in some\nareas even surpassed human capabilities. Deep neural networks can capture\ncomplex non-linear features; however this ability comes at the cost of high\ncomputational and memory requirements. State-of-art networks require billions\nof arithmetic operations and millions of parameters. To enable embedded devices\nsuch as smartphones, Google glasses and monitoring cameras with the astonishing\npower of deep learning, dedicated hardware accelerators can be used to decrease\nboth execution time and power consumption. In applications where fast\nconnection to the cloud is not guaranteed or where privacy is important,\ncomputation needs to be done locally. Many hardware accelerators for deep\nneural networks have been proposed recently. A first important step of\naccelerator design is hardware-oriented approximation of deep networks, which\nenables energy-efficient inference. We present Ristretto, a fast and automated\nframework for CNN approximation. Ristretto simulates the hardware arithmetic of\na custom hardware accelerator. The framework reduces the bit-width of network\nparameters and outputs of resource-intense layers, which reduces the chip area\nfor multiplication units significantly. Alternatively, Ristretto can remove the\nneed for multipliers altogether, resulting in an adder-only arithmetic. The\ntool fine-tunes trimmed networks to achieve high classification accuracy. Since\ntraining of deep neural networks can be time-consuming, Ristretto uses highly\noptimized routines which run on the GPU. This enables fast compression of any\ngiven network. Given a maximum tolerance of 1%, Ristretto can successfully\ncondense CaffeNet and SqueezeNet to 8-bit. The code for Ristretto is available.\n\n**Published:** 2016-05-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient linear layers*\n\n*Yoon Kim, Rameswar Panda, Yikang Shen, Bailin Wang, Songlin Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. A General Automatic Method for Optimal Construction of Matrix Product Operators Using Bipartite Graph Theory\n\n*From Search Query: matrix operation optimization*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Constructing matrix product operators (MPO) is at the core of the modern\ndensity matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and its time dependent formulation.\nFor DMRG to be conveniently used in different problems described by different\nHamiltonians, in this work we propose a new generic algorithm to construct the\nMPO of an arbitrary operator with a sum-of-products form based on the bipartite\ngraph theory. We show that the method has the following advantages: (i) It is\nautomatic in that only the definition of the operator is required; (ii) It is\nsymbolic thus free of any numerical error; (iii) The complementary operator\ntechnique can be fully employed so that the resulting MPO is globally optimal\nfor any given order of degrees of freedom; (iv) The symmetry of the system\ncould be fully employed to reduce the dimension of MPO. To demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the new algorithm, the MPOs of Hamiltonians ranging from the\nprototypical spin-boson model and Holstein model to the more complicated ab\ninitio electronic Hamiltonian and the anharmonic vibrational Hamiltonian with\nsextic force field are constructed. It is found that for the former three\ncases, our automatic algorithm can reproduce exactly the same MPOs as the\noptimally hand-crafted ones already known in the literature.\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-13\n\n\n\n#### 4.

The adoption of sparse representation in leading ML frameworks such as PyTorch is incomplete, however, with support for both automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration missing. In this work, we present an implementation of a CSR-based sparse matrix wrapper for PyTorch with CUDA acceleration for basic matrix operations, as well as automatic differentiability. We also present several applications of the resulting sparse kernels to optimization problems, demonstrating ease of implementation and performance measurements versus their dense counterparts.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Applications of Deep Neural Networks with Keras\n\n*From Search Query: neural network memory hierarchy*\n\n*Jeff Heaton*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning is a group of exciting new technologies for neural networks. Through a combination of advanced training techniques and neural network architectural components, it is now possible to create neural networks that can handle tabular data, images, text, and audio as both input and output. Deep learning allows a neural network to learn hierarchies of information in a way that is like the function of the human brain. This course will introduce the student to classic neural network structures, Convolution Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU), General Adversarial Networks (GAN), and reinforcement learning. Application of these architectures to computer vision, time series, security, natural language processing (NLP), and data generation will be covered. High-Performance Computing (HPC) aspects will demonstrate how deep learning can be leveraged both on graphical processing units (GPUs), as well as grids. Focus is primarily upon the application of deep learning to problems, with some introduction to mathematical foundations. Readers will use the Python programming language to implement deep learning using Google TensorFlow and Keras. It is not necessary to know Python prior to this book; however, familiarity with at least one programming language is assumed.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-11\n\n\n\n#### 6. Optimizing the Memory Hierarchy by Compositing Automatic Transformations on Computations and Data\n\n*From Search Query: neural network memory hierarchy*\n\n*Peng Di, Jie Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Optimizing compilers exploit the memory hierarchy using loop tiling and fusion, but these two transformations usually interfere with each other due to the oversight of transformations on data in memories. We present a novel composition of loop tiling and fusion in this paper. Unlike existing tiling-after-fusion algorithms that only transform computation spaces, our approach first applies rectangular/parallelogram tiling to live-out computation spaces for fitting the memory hierarchy, followed by the computation of the memory footprints required by each tile. The upwards exposed data extracted from the memory footprints are used to determine the tile shapes of intermediate computation spaces, allowing the construction of arbitrary tile shapes. Finally, our technique implements a post-tiling fusion strategy for maximizing data locality without losing tilability or parallelism of live-out computation spaces, thereby enabling storage reduction and reuse, and optimizing the memory hierarchy. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve superior performance on both CPU and GPU architectures over the state of the art by experimenting on 11 benchmarks extracted from numerous domains including neural networks, image processing, sparse matrix computation and linear algebra. Also, the results of the ResNet-50 model on an AI accelerator show that our approach can obtain 16% performance improvement.\n\n**Proceeding:** 53rd-annual-ieee-acm-international-symposium\n\n**Published:** 2020-11-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on hardware-efficient implementations, matrix operation optimization, and memory hierarchy considerations, here are some key points and references from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n### Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Linear Layers\n\n1. **Approximate Computing Techniques**:\n   The study on dynamic power control in hardware neural networks highlights the use of approximate multipliers to reduce power consumption while maintaining acceptable accuracy. This approach can be applied to linear layers in neural networks, optimizing for power efficiency and area reduction.\n\n2. **Memristor-Based In-Memory Computing**:\n   The paper on efficient memristor accelerators for transformer self-attention discusses the use of memristor-based in-memory computing, which can significantly reduce latency and energy consumption. This technology can be leveraged to optimize linear layers by performing computations directly in memory, reducing data transfer overhead.\n\n### Advanced Optimization Techniques for Matrix Operations\n\n1. **Matrix Decomposition and Kernel Fusion**:\n   The concept of using matrix decomposition to optimize matrix operations, as seen in the FlashFFTConv approach, can be applied to linear layers. This involves breaking down complex matrix operations into simpler ones that can be executed more efficiently using specialized hardware units[Analysis Note, FlashFFTConv].\n\n2. **Optimized Mapping Mechanisms**:\n   The paper on memristor accelerators mentions optimized mapping mechanisms and efficient data supply strategies to enhance throughput. Similar techniques can be applied to matrix operations in linear layers to improve performance and reduce latency.\n\n### Memory Hierarchy Considerations in Neural Network Design\n\n1. **IO-Aware Computation Strategies**:\n   The FlashAttention approach emphasizes the importance of minimizing memory reads/writes between different hierarchy levels. This can be applied to linear layers by using tiling strategies to optimize memory access patterns, reducing the number of accesses to higher latency memory levels[Analysis Note, FlashAttention].\n\n2. **Multi-Level Tiling and Block-Based Computation**:\n   Multi-level tiling strategies and block-based computation patterns can improve memory locality and reduce communication overhead. These techniques can be adapted to optimize the memory access patterns in linear layers, ensuring efficient use of the memory hierarchy[Analysis Note].\n\n3. **Hardware-Specific Memory Constraints**:\n   The design of neural networks should consider the specific memory hierarchies of the hardware they are deployed on. For example, optimizing for GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM can significantly improve performance. Similar considerations should be applied to other hardware platforms like FPGAs and ASICs[Analysis Note, FlashAttention].\n\n### Additional Insights\n\n- **Parallelization and Work Distribution**:\n  Efficient work distribution across thread blocks and warps, as well as reducing communication through shared memory, can further optimize the performance of linear layers. This is particularly relevant when implementing these layers on parallel computing architectures[Analysis Note, FlashAttention-2].\n\n- **Specialized Hardware Designs**:\n  Specialized hardware designs, such as those using FPGAs and ASICs, can be tailored to the requirements of neural network computations, reducing redundant operations and memory accesses.

Structured matrices are a powerful abstraction for efficient representations and algorithms. In this work, we will show that SSMs are equivalent to another class of structured matrices that have not previously been used in deep learning, and use this connection to derive efficient methods and algorithms. ### 2.4 Overview: Structured State Space Duality\n\nWhile this paper develops a much richer framework of connections between SSMs, attention, and structured matrices, we provide a brief summary of the main method, which is actually quite self-contained and simple algorithmically. Recurrent (Linear) Form. The state space dual (SSD) layer can be defined as a special case of the selective SSM (2). The standard computation of an SSM as a recurrence (or parallel scan) can be applied, which has linear complexity in sequence length. Compared to the version used in Mamba, SSD has two minor differences:\n\n- The structure on $A$ is further simplified from diagonal to scalar times identity structure. Each $A_{t}$ can also be identified with just a scalar in this case. - We use a larger head dimension $P$, compared to $P=1$ used in Mamba. Typically $P=\\{64,128\\}$ is chosen which is similar to conventions for modern Transformers. Compared to the original selective SSM, these changes can be viewed as slightly decreasing the expressive power in return for significant training efficiency improvements. In particular, our new algorithms will allow the use of matrix multiplication units on modern accelerators. Dual (Quadratic) Form. The dual form of SSD is a quadratic computation closely related to attention, defined as\n\n$$\n\\left(L \\circ Q K^{\\top}\\right) \\cdot V \\quad L_{i j}= \\begin{cases}a_{i} \\times \\cdots \\times a_{j+1} & i \\geq j \\\\ 0 & i<j\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nwhere $a_{i}$ are input-dependent scalars bounded in $[0,1]$. Compared to standard softmax attention, there are two main differences\n\n- The softmax is dropped. - The attention matrix is multiplied elementwise-wise by an additional mask matrix $L$. Both of these changes can be viewed as addressing problems in vanilla attention. For example, the softmax has been recently observed to cause problems in attention scores, such as the \"attention sink\" phenomenon (Darcet et al. 2024; Xiao et al. 2024). More importantly, the mask matrix $L$ can be viewed as replacing the heuristic positional embeddings of Transformers with a different data-dependent positional mask that controls how much information is transfered across time. More broadly, this form is an instance of our structured masked attention generalization of linear attention, defined in Section 4. Matrix Form and SSD Algorithm. The various forms of SSD are connected through a unified matrix representation, by showing that SSMs have a matrix transformation form $Y=M X$ for a matrix $M_{\\theta} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(T, T)}$ that depends on $\\theta=(A, B, C)$. In particular, the dual form of SSD is equivalent to naive (quadratic-time) multiplication by the matrix $M$, and the recurrent form is a particular efficient (linear-time) algorithm that leverages the structure in $M$. Going beyond these, any algorithm for multiplication by $M$ can be applied. Our proposed hardware-efficient SSD algorithm (Section 6) is a new structured matrix multiplication method that involves block decompositions of $M$, which obtains better efficiency tradeoffs than either the pure linear or quadratic forms. It is relatively simple and easy-to-implement compared to general selective SSMs (Gu and Dao 2023); Listing 1 provides a complete implementation in a few lines of code.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/86 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\nSeveral recent and concurrent works such as RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) and GateLoop (Katsch 2023) strengthen this to more general forms of $L$ (Section 10). In this work, our formulation of structured masked attention will strongly generalize these ideas. ### 2.3 Structured Matrices\n\nGeneral matrices $M \\in \\mathbb{R}^{(\\mathrm{T}, \\mathrm{T})}$ require $\\mathrm{T}^{2}$ parameters to represent and $O\\left(\\mathrm{~T}^{2}\\right)$ time to perform basic operations such as matrix-vector multiplication. Structured matrices are those that\n(i) can be represented in subquadratic (ideally linear) parameters through a compressed representation, and\n(ii) have fast algorithms (most importantly matrix multiplication) by operating directly on this compressed representation. Perhaps the most canonical families of structured matrices are sparse and low-rank matrices. However, there exist many other families, such as Toeplitz, Cauchy, Vandermonde, and butterfly matrices, which have all been used in machine learning for efficient models (Dao, Gu, et al.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/86 (Score: 0.04)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2402.19427 (2024).

This paper studies a unifying matrix mixer view of sequence mixers that can be conceptualized as a linear map on the input sequence. This framework encompasses a broad range of well-known sequence models, including the self-attention of Transformers as well as recent strong alternatives such as structured state space models (SSMs), and allows understanding downstream characteristics such as efficiency and expressivity through properties of their structured matrix class. We identify a key axis of matrix parameterizations termed sequence alignment, which increases the flexibility and performance of matrix mixers, providing insights into the strong performance of Transformers and recent SSMs such as Mamba. Furthermore, the matrix mixer framework offers a systematic approach to developing sequence mixers with desired properties, allowing us to develop several new sub-quadratic sequence models. In particular, we propose a natural bidirectional extension of the Mamba model (Hydra), parameterized as a quasiseparable matrix mixer, which demonstrates superior performance over other sequence models including Transformers on non-causal tasks.

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/35 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Learning Representations, 2018.

Monarch: Expressive Structured Matrices for Efficient and Accurate Training\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices neural networks*\n\n*Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, N. Sohoni, Arjun D Desai, Michael Poli, Jessica Grogan, Alexander Liu, Aniruddh Rao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution and can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications.\n\n**Abstract:** Large neural networks excel in many domains, but they are expensive to train and fine-tune. A popular approach to reduce their compute or memory requirements is to replace dense weight matrices with structured ones (e.g., sparse, low-rank, Fourier transform). These methods have not seen widespread adoption (1) in end-to-end training due to unfavorable efficiency--quality tradeoffs, and (2) in dense-to-sparse fine-tuning due to lack of tractable algorithms to approximate a given dense weight matrix. To address these issues, we propose a class of matrices (Monarch) that is hardware-efficient (they are parameterized as products of two block-diagonal matrices for better hardware utilization) and expressive (they can represent many commonly used transforms). Surprisingly, the problem of approximating a dense weight matrix with a Monarch matrix, though nonconvex, has an analytical optimal solution. These properties of Monarch matrices unlock new ways to train and fine-tune sparse and dense models. We empirically validate that Monarch can achieve favorable accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs in several end-to-end sparse training applications: speeding up ViT and GPT-2 training on ImageNet classification and Wikitext-103 language modeling by 2x with comparable model quality, and reducing the error on PDE solving and MRI reconstruction tasks by 40%. In sparse-to-dense training, with a simple technique called\"reverse sparsification,\"Monarch matrices serve as a useful intermediate representation to speed up GPT-2 pretraining on OpenWebText by 2x without quality drop. The same technique brings 23% faster BERT pretraining than even the very optimized implementation from Nvidia that set the MLPerf 1.1 record. In dense-to-sparse fine-tuning, as a proof-of-concept, our Monarch approximation algorithm speeds up BERT fine-tuning on GLUE by 1.7x with comparable accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 71  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 3. AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific memory optimization*\n\n*Kai Lv, Hang Yan, Qipeng Guo, Haijun Lv, Xipeng Qiu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter, is introduced and achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

Hardware-Aware Compression with Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) Hashing\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific memory optimization*\n\n*Aditya Desai, K. Zhou, Anshumali Shrivastava*\n\n**TL;DR:** With ROAST, the authors can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint in text and image classification tasks, and introduce global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest.\n\n**Abstract:** Advancements in deep learning are often associated with increasing model sizes. Training and deploying large models require sophisticated hardware and incur significantly higher costs. Thus, model compression is a widely explored approach to solving the problem. However, SOTA techniques fall short in one or more desirable aspects of compression - for instance, pruning does not reduce memory for training, quantization can only provide up to 32 \u00d7 compression, Hashed-Net is cache-inefficient, etc. This paper proposes a model-agnostic, cache-friendly, and hardware-aware model compression approach: Random Operation Access Specific Tile (ROAST) hashing. ROAST collapses the parameters by club-bing them through a lightweight mapping. While clubbing these parameters, ROAST utilizes cache hierarchies by aligning the memory access pattern with the parameter access pattern. ROAST is up to \u223c 25 \u00d7 faster to train and \u223c 50 \u00d7 faster to infer than the popular parameter sharing method HashedNet. Additionally, ROAST introduces global weight sharing, which is empirically and theoretically superior to local weight sharing in HashedNet, and can be of independent interest. With ROAST, we can efficiently train and deploy the model using a much smaller memory footprint ( \u223c 10 \u2212 100 \u00d7 lesser) in text and image classification tasks.

Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific memory optimization*\n\n*Aviral Kumar, A. Yazdanbakhsh, Milad Hashemi, Kevin Swersky, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a\"simulation-driven\"approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a\"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. How to Capture Higher-order Correlations? Generalizing Matrix Softmax Attention to Kronecker Computation\n\n*From Search Query: efficient matrix computation primitives*\n\n*Josh Alman, Zhao Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work studies a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise correlations, and shows that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations and yields a natural tradeoff between the boundedness of the entries, and order of the tensor one may use for more expressive, efficient attention computation.\n\n**Abstract:** In the classical transformer attention scheme, we are given three $n \\times d$ size matrices $Q, K, V$ (the query, key, and value tokens), and the goal is to compute a new $n \\times d$ size matrix $D^{-1} \\exp(QK^\\top) V$ where $D = \\mathrm{diag}( \\exp(QK^\\top) {\\bf 1}_n )$. In this work, we study a generalization of attention which captures triple-wise correlations. This generalization is able to solve problems about detecting triple-wise connections that were shown to be impossible for transformers. The potential downside of this generalization is that it appears as though computations are even more difficult, since the straightforward algorithm requires cubic time in $n$. However, we show that in the bounded-entry setting (which arises in practice, and which is well-studied in both theory and practice), there is actually a near-linear time algorithm. More precisely, we show that bounded entries are both necessary and sufficient for quickly performing generalized computations: $\\bullet$ On the positive side, if all entries of the input matrices are bounded above by $o(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$ then we show how to approximate the ``tensor-type'' attention matrix in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time. $\\bullet$ On the negative side, we show that if the entries of the input matrices may be as large as $\\Omega(\\sqrt[3]{\\log n})$, then there is no algorithm that runs faster than $n^{3-o(1)}$ (assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity theory). We also show that our construction, algorithms, and lower bounds naturally generalize to higher-order tensors and correlations. Interestingly, the higher the order of the tensors, the lower the bound on the entries needs to be for an efficient algorithm. Our results thus yield a natural tradeoff between the boundedness of the entries, and order of the tensor one may use for more expressive, efficient attention computation.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7. M-FAC: Efficient Matrix-Free Approximations of Second-Order Information\n\n*From Search Query: efficient matrix computation primitives*\n\n*Elias Frantar, Eldar Kurtic, Dan Alistarh*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of the Hessians by the empirical Fisher matrix.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently approximating local curvature information of the loss function is a key tool for optimization and compression of deep neural networks. Yet, most existing methods to approximate second-order information have high computational or storage costs, which can limit their practicality. In this work, we investigate matrix-free, linear-time approaches for estimating Inverse-Hessian Vector Products (IHVPs) for the case when the Hessian can be approximated as a sum of rank-one matrices, as in the classic approximation of the Hessian by the empirical Fisher matrix. We propose two new algorithms as part of a framework called M-FAC: the first algorithm is tailored towards network compression and can compute the IHVP for dimension $d$, if the Hessian is given as a sum of $m$ rank-one matrices, using $O(dm^2)$ precomputation, $O(dm)$ cost for computing the IHVP, and query cost $O(m)$ for any single element of the inverse Hessian. The second algorithm targets an optimization setting, where we wish to compute the product between the inverse Hessian, estimated over a sliding window of optimization steps, and a given gradient direction, as required for preconditioned SGD. We give an algorithm with cost $O(dm + m^2)$ for computing the IHVP and $O(dm + m^3)$ for adding or removing any gradient from the sliding window. These two algorithms yield state-of-the-art results for network pruning and optimization with lower computational overhead relative to existing second-order methods.

Kwon, Byeongwook Kim, Youngjoo Lee, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper introduces LUT-GEMM, an efficient kernel for quantized matrix multiplication, which not only eliminates the resource-intensive dequantization process but also reduces computational costs compared to previous kernels for weight-only quantization.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advances in self-supervised learning and the Transformer architecture have significantly improved natural language processing (NLP), achieving remarkably low perplexity. However, the growing size of NLP models introduces a memory wall problem during the generation phase. To mitigate this issue, recent efforts have focused on quantizing model weights to sub-4-bit precision while preserving full precision for activations, resulting in practical speed-ups during inference on a single GPU. However, these improvements primarily stem from reduced memory movement, which necessitates a resource-intensive dequantization process rather than actual computational reduction. In this paper, we introduce LUT-GEMM, an efficient kernel for quantized matrix multiplication, which not only eliminates the resource-intensive dequantization process but also reduces computational costs compared to previous kernels for weight-only quantization. Furthermore, we proposed group-wise quantization to offer a flexible trade-off between compression ratio and accuracy. The impact of LUT-GEMM is facilitated by implementing high compression ratios through low-bit quantization and efficient LUT-based operations. We show experimentally that when applied to the OPT-175B model with 3-bit quantization, LUT-GEMM substantially accelerates token generation latency, achieving a remarkable 2.1$\\times$ improvement on a single GPU when compared to OPTQ, which relies on the costly dequantization process.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Differentiable Learning of Generalized Structured Matrices for Efficient Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: structured matrices neural networks*\n\n*Hun-Seok Kim, Changwoo Lee*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper investigates efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) to replace dense unstructured weight matrices with structured ones that possess desired properties. The challenge arises because the optimal weight matrix structure in popular neural network models is obscure in most cases and may vary from layer to layer even in the same network. Prior structured matrices proposed for efficient DNNs were mostly hand-crafted without a generalized framework to systematically learn them. To address this issue, we propose a generalized and differentiable framework to learn efficient structures of weight matrices by gradient descent. We first define a new class of structured matrices that covers a wide range of structured matrices in the literature by adjusting the structural parameters. Then, the frequency-domain differentiable parameterization scheme based on the Gaussian-Dirichlet kernel is adopted to learn the structural parameters by proximal gradient descent. On the image and language tasks, our method learns efficient DNNs with structured matrices, achieving lower complexity and/or higher performance than prior approaches that employ low-rank, block-sparse, or block-low-rank matrices.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-29\n\n\n\n#### 3. The Era of 1-bit LLMs: All Large Language Models are in 1.58 Bits\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific memory optimization*\n\n*Furu Wei, Jilong Xue, Ruiping Wang, Li Dong, Shaohan Huang, Wenhui Wang, Lei Wang, Lingxiao Ma, Hongyu Wang, Shuming Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent research, such as BitNet, is paving the way for a new era of 1-bit Large Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we introduce a 1-bit LLM variant, namely BitNet b1.58, in which every single parameter (or weight) of the LLM is ternary {-1, 0, 1}. It matches the full-precision (i.e., FP16 or BF16) Transformer LLM with the same model size and training tokens in terms of both perplexity and end-task performance, while being significantly more cost-effective in terms of latency, memory, throughput, and energy consumption. More profoundly, the 1.58-bit LLM defines a new scaling law and recipe for training new generations of LLMs that are both high-performance and cost-effective. Furthermore, it enables a new computation paradigm and opens the door for designing specific hardware optimized for 1-bit LLMs.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-27\n\n\n\n#### 4. AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: hardware-specific memory optimization*\n\n*Song Han, Xingyu Dang, Guangxuan Xiao, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Chuang Gan, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Jiaming Tang, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Discovering faster matrix multiplication algorithms with reinforcement learning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient matrix computation primitives*\n\n*Pushmeet Kohli, Demis Hassabis, David Silver, Grzegorz Swirszcz, Julian Schrittwieser, Francisco J. R. Ruiz, Alexander Novikov, Mohammadamin Barekatain, Bernardino Romera-Paredes, Thomas Hubert, Aja Huang, Matej Balog, Alhussein Fawzi*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the efficiency of algorithms for fundamental computations can have a widespread impact, as it can affect the overall speed of a large amount of computations. Matrix multiplication is one such primitive task, occurring in many systems\u2014from neural networks to scientific computing routines. The automatic discovery of algorithms using machine learning offers the prospect of reaching beyond human intuition and outperforming the current best human-designed algorithms. However, automating the algorithm discovery procedure is intricate, as the space of possible algorithms is enormous. Here we report a deep reinforcement learning approach based on AlphaZero1 for discovering efficient and provably correct algorithms for the multiplication of arbitrary matrices. Our agent, AlphaTensor, is trained to play a single-player game where the objective is finding tensor decompositions within a finite factor space. AlphaTensor discovered algorithms that outperform the state-of-the-art complexity for many matrix sizes. Particularly relevant is the case of 4\u2009\u00d7\u20094 matrices in a finite field, where AlphaTensor\u2019s algorithm improves on Strassen\u2019s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago2. We further showcase the flexibility of AlphaTensor through different use-cases: algorithms with state-of-the-art complexity for structured matrix multiplication and improved practical efficiency by optimizing matrix multiplication for runtime on specific hardware. Our results highlight AlphaTensor\u2019s ability to accelerate the process of algorithmic discovery on a range of problems, and to optimize for different criteria.\n\n**Proceeding:** nature-2022-10\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 6. Triton: An Intermediate Language and Compiler for Tiled Neural Network Computations\n\n*From Search Query: efficient matrix computation primitives*\n\n*David Cox, H. T. Kung, Philippe Tillet*\n\n**Abstract:** The validation and deployment of novel research ideas in the field of Deep Learning is often limited by the availability of efficient compute kernels for certain basic primitives. In particular, operations that cannot leverage existing vendor libraries (e.g., cuBLAS, cuDNN) are at risk of facing poor device utilization unless custom implementations are written by experts \u2013 usually at the expense of portability. For this reason, the development of new programming abstractions for specifying custom Deep Learning workloads at a minimal performance cost has become crucial.\r\nWe present Triton, a language and compiler centered around the concept of tile, i.e., statically shaped multi-dimensional sub-arrays. Our approach revolves around (1) a C-based language and an LLVM-based intermediate representation (IR) for expressing tensor programs in terms of operations on parametric tile variables and (2) a set of novel tile-level optimization passes for compiling these programs into efficient GPU code. We demonstrate how Triton can be used to build portable implementations of matrix multiplication and convolution kernels on par with hand-tuned vendor libraries (cuBLAS / cuDNN), or for efficiently implementing recent research ideas such as shift convolutions.\n\n**Proceeding:** mapl-2019-6\n\n**Published:** 2019-06-22\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on novel structured matrix formats, hardware-specific memory optimization, and efficient matrix computation primitives, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Novel Structured Matrix Formats and Their Hardware Implementation\n\n- The work on **Monarch matrices** and similar structured matrices is highly relevant. These matrices, as mentioned in the analysis note, capture many linear transforms and achieve high hardware efficiency, especially on GPUs. They scale sub-quadratically, which is beneficial for large-scale neural networks[3|.\n- The paper \"Searching for Efficient Linear Layers over a Continuous Space of Structured Matrices\" discusses a unifying framework for searching among all linear operators expressible via Einstein summation. This includes various structured matrices like low-rank, Kronecker, Tensor-Train, and Block Tensor-Train (BTT) matrices. The BTT-MoE architecture proposed in this work sparsifies computation in the BTT structure, providing substantial compute-efficiency gains over dense layers and standard MoE.\n\n## Memory Optimization Techniques Specific to Different Hardware Platforms\n\n- **FlashAttention** is a notable example that uses tiling to reduce memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. This approach significantly reduces memory access costs, which is crucial for optimizing the memory hierarchy on GPUs[Analysis Note].\n- The importance of IO-aware computation and memory hierarchy optimization is highlighted. Different hardware platforms (e.g., GPUs, TPUs, CPUs) have different memory hierarchies, and optimizing memory access patterns can significantly impact performance. Tiling strategies and considering different memory levels (HBM, SRAM, cache) are essential for efficient memory optimization[Analysis Note].\n\n## Alternative Computation Primitives for Efficient Matrix Operations\n\n- **ShiftAddViT** demonstrates the use of simpler operations such as bitwise shifts and additions to replace complex multiplications. This approach achieves significant latency reductions and energy savings on GPUs. Such alternative computation primitives can be adapted for matrix operations in autoregressive language models to improve efficiency[Analysis Note].\n- The concept of **matrix arithmetic-only operations**, as seen in MA-BERT, allows for efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. This simplification of operations can be applied to matrix computations in autoregressive models, enabling hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines[Analysis Note].\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n- **Hardware Adaptability**: Different hardware platforms require different optimization strategies. It is crucial to consider platform-specific memory hierarchies and maintain flexibility across hardware to ensure efficient implementation[Analysis Note].\n- **Efficient Implementation Strategies**: The use of structured matrices and alternative computation primitives should be balanced with the need to maintain model expressiveness and accuracy. Efficient implementation strategies that consider the specific hardware and the computational complexity of matrix operations are essential for improving autoregressive language models[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that leverage novel structured matrix formats, optimize memory access patterns for different hardware platforms, and utilize efficient computation primitives to enhance overall performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 0.99)\n\n*Simran Arora, Aman Timalsina, Aaryan Singhal, Benjamin Spector, Sabri Eyuboglu, Xinyi Zhao, Ashish Rao, Atri Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work empirically and theoretically shows that the recurrent memory required to solve set disjointness changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent large language models that compete with Transformers in language modeling perplexity are emerging at a rapid rate (e.g., Mamba, RWKV). Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

Fast Transformers via Sketching Polynomial Kernels (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Praneeth Kacham, V. Mirrokni, Peilin Zhong*\n\n**Published in:**  (2023)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper demonstrates that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality, and develops polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic time and memory complexity inherent to self-attention mechanisms, with respect to sequence length, presents a critical computational bottleneck in the training and deployment of large-scale Transformer-based language models. Recent theoretical results indicate the intractability of sub-quadratic softmax attention approximation under reasonable complexity assumptions. This paper addresses this challenge by first demonstrating that polynomial attention with high degree can effectively replace softmax without sacrificing model quality. Next, we develop polynomial sketching techniques from numerical linear algebra to achieve linear-time polynomial attention with approximation guarantees. Crucially, our approach achieves this speedup without requiring the sparsification of attention matrices. We also present a block-based algorithm to apply causal masking efficiently. Combining these techniques, we provide \\emph{PolySketchFormer}, a practical linear-time Transformer architecture for language modeling that offers provable guarantees. We validate PolySketchFormer empirically by training language models capable of handling long contexts. These experiments utilize both synthetic and real-world datasets (PG19, Wikipedia and C4) on Google Cloud TPUs. For context lengths of 32k and GPT-2 style models, our model achieves a 2.5-4x speedup in training compared to FlashAttention, with no observed degradation in quality across our experiments.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 29/40 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nFoundations and Trends\u00ae in Theoretical Computer Science, 10(1-2):1-157, 2014.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

ShiftAddViT: Mixture of Multiplication Primitives Towards Efficient Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware MatMul-free transformers*\n\n*Haoran You, Huihong Shi, Yipin Guo, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed ShiftAddViT, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown impressive performance and have become a unified backbone for multiple vision tasks. However, both the attention mechanism and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) in ViTs are not sufficiently efficient due to dense multiplications, leading to costly training and inference. To this end, we propose to reparameterize pre-trained ViTs with a mixture of multiplication primitives, e.g., bitwise shifts and additions, towards a new type of multiplication-reduced model, dubbed $\\textbf{ShiftAddViT}$, which aims to achieve end-to-end inference speedups on GPUs without requiring training from scratch. Specifically, all $\\texttt{MatMuls}$ among queries, keys, and values are reparameterized using additive kernels, after mapping queries and keys to binary codes in Hamming space. The remaining MLPs or linear layers are then reparameterized with shift kernels. We utilize TVM to implement and optimize those customized kernels for practical hardware deployment on GPUs. We find that such a reparameterization on attention maintains model accuracy, while inevitably leading to accuracy drops when being applied to MLPs. To marry the best of both worlds, we further propose a new mixture of experts (MoE) framework to reparameterize MLPs by taking multiplication or its primitives as experts, e.g., multiplication and shift, and designing a new latency-aware load-balancing loss. Such a loss helps to train a generic router for assigning a dynamic amount of input tokens to different experts according to their latency. Extensive experiments on various 2D/3D Transformer-based vision tasks consistently validate the effectiveness of our proposed ShiftAddViT, achieving up to $\\textbf{5.18$\\times$}$ latency reductions on GPUs and $\\textbf{42.9}$% energy savings, while maintaining a comparable accuracy as original or efficient ViTs.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. QA-LoRA: Quantization-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Integrated hierarchical hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaotao Gu, Xin Chen, Heng Chang, Hengheng Zhang, Zhensu Chen, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm that equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; and after fine- Tuning,the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

HiCLIP: Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining with Hierarchy-aware Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Integrated hierarchical hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Shijie Geng, Jianbo Yuan, Yu Tian, Yuxiao Chen, Yongfeng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of large-scale contrastive vision-language pretraining (CLIP) has benefited both visual recognition and multimodal content understanding. The concise design brings CLIP the advantage in inference efficiency against other vision-language models with heavier cross-attention fusion layers, making it a popular choice for a wide spectrum of downstream tasks. However, CLIP does not explicitly capture the hierarchical nature of high-level and fine-grained semantics conveyed in images and texts, which is arguably critical to vision-language understanding and reasoning. To this end, we equip both the visual and language branches in CLIP with hierarchy-aware attentions, namely Hierarchy-aware CLIP (HiCLIP), to progressively discover semantic hierarchies layer-by-layer from both images and texts in an unsupervised manner. As a result, such hierarchical aggregation significantly improves the cross-modal alignment. To demonstrate the advantages of HiCLIP, we conduct qualitative analysis on its unsupervised hierarchy induction during inference, as well as extensive quantitative experiments on both visual recognition and vision-language downstream tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. ReasoningLM: Enabling Structural Subgraph Reasoning in Pre-trained Language Models for Question Answering over Knowledge Graph\n\n*From Search Query: Integrated hierarchical hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Jinhao Jiang, Kun Zhou, Wayne Xin Zhao, Yaliang Li, Ji-Rong Wen*\n\n**TL;DR:** In this work, a subgraph-aware self-attention mechanism to imitate the GNN for performing structured reasoning for KGQA is proposed, and an adaptation tuning strategy to adapt the model parameters with 20,000 subgraphs with synthesized questions is adopted.\n\n**Abstract:** Question Answering over Knowledge Graph (KGQA) aims to seek answer entities for the natural language question from a large-scale Knowledge Graph~(KG). To better perform reasoning on KG, recent work typically adopts a pre-trained language model~(PLM) to model the question, and a graph neural network~(GNN) based module to perform multi-hop reasoning on the KG. Despite the effectiveness, due to the divergence in model architecture, the PLM and GNN are not closely integrated, limiting the knowledge sharing and fine-grained feature interactions. To solve it, we aim to simplify the above two-module approach, and develop a more capable PLM that can directly support subgraph reasoning for KGQA, namely ReasoningLM. In our approach, we propose a subgraph-aware self-attention mechanism to imitate the GNN for performing structured reasoning, and also adopt an adaptation tuning strategy to adapt the model parameters with 20,000 subgraphs with synthesized questions. After adaptation, the PLM can be parameter-efficient fine-tuned on downstream tasks. Experiments show that ReasoningLM surpasses state-of-the-art models by a large margin, even with fewer updated parameters and less training data.

Pixelated Butterfly: Simple and Efficient Sparse training for Neural Network Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention with hardware optimization*\n\n*Beidi Chen, Tri Dao, Kaizhao Liang, Jiaming Yang, Zhao Song, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 6. On-Device Training Under 256KB Memory\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention with hardware optimization*\n\n*Ji Lin, Ligeng Zhu, Wei-Ming Chen, Wei-Chen Wang, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW.\n\n**Abstract:** On-device training enables the model to adapt to new data collected from the sensors by fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Users can benefit from customized AI models without having to transfer the data to the cloud, protecting the privacy. However, the training memory consumption is prohibitive for IoT devices that have tiny memory resources. We propose an algorithm-system co-design framework to make on-device training possible with only 256KB of memory. On-device training faces two unique challenges: (1) the quantized graphs of neural networks are hard to optimize due to low bit-precision and the lack of normalization; (2) the limited hardware resource does not allow full back-propagation. To cope with the optimization difficulty, we propose Quantization-Aware Scaling to calibrate the gradient scales and stabilize 8-bit quantized training. To reduce the memory footprint, we propose Sparse Update to skip the gradient computation of less important layers and sub-tensors. The algorithm innovation is implemented by a lightweight training system, Tiny Training Engine, which prunes the backward computation graph to support sparse updates and offload the runtime auto-differentiation to compile time. Our framework is the first solution to enable tiny on-device training of convolutional neural networks under 256KB SRAM and 1MB Flash without auxiliary memory, using less than 1/1000 of the memory of PyTorch and TensorFlow while matching the accuracy on tinyML application VWW. Our study enables IoT devices not only to perform inference but also to continuously adapt to new data for on-device lifelong learning.

STEP: Learning N: M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention with hardware optimization*\n\n*Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Chris De Sa, A. Yazdanbakhsh*\n\n**TL;DR:** STEP is proposed, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N: M masks (mask-learning phase).\n\n**Abstract:** Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. TorchSparse: Efficient Point Cloud Inference Engine\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive sparse attention with hardware optimization*\n\n*Song Han, Yujun Lin, Xiuyu Li, Zhijian Liu, Haotian Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep learning on point clouds has received increased attention thanks to its wide applications in AR/VR and autonomous driving. These applications require low latency and high accuracy to provide real-time user experience and ensure user safety. Unlike conventional dense workloads, the sparse and irregular nature of point clouds poses severe challenges to running sparse CNNs efficiently on the general-purpose hardware. Furthermore, existing sparse acceleration techniques for 2D images do not translate to 3D point clouds. In this paper, we introduce TorchSparse, a high-performance point cloud inference engine that accelerates the sparse convolution computation on GPUs. TorchSparse directly optimizes the two bottlenecks of sparse convolution: irregular computation and data movement. It applies adaptive matrix multiplication grouping to trade computation for better regularity, achieving 1.4-1.5x speedup for matrix multiplication. It also optimizes the data movement by adopting vectorized, quantized and fused locality-aware memory access, reducing the memory movement cost by 2.7x. Evaluated on seven representative models across three benchmark datasets, TorchSparse achieves 1.6x and 1.5x measured end-to-end speedup over the state-of-the-art MinkowskiEngine and SpConv, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-21\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the `FastTTTLinear` autoregressive language model by integrating several advanced techniques to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance.

These works discuss designing models that are optimized for different hardware and using adaptive sparse attention to reduce computational overhead.\n\n4. **MatMul-Free Models**:\n   - Eliminating matrix multiplications (MatMul operations) can significantly reduce computational overhead. The work \"Scalable MatMul-free Language Modeling\" by Zhu et al. (2024) is highly relevant, as it shows how MatMul operations can be eliminated while maintaining strong performance.\n\n### Most Useful Information\n\n1. **State Space Models and Hierarchical Processing**:\n   - The use of State Space Models (SSMs) in conjunction with hierarchical processing is a key area of focus. References like Zuo et al. (2022) and Shi et al. (2024) provide insights into how SSMs can be integrated into transformer architectures to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\n2. **Adaptive Sparse Attention**:\n   - Adaptive sparse attention methods, such as \"SampleAttention\" by Zhu et al. (2024), can significantly reduce computational overhead while maintaining performance. This is particularly useful when combined with hardware-aware optimizations.\n\n3. **Hardware-Aware Designs**:\n   - Works like Wang et al. (2020) and Zhu et al. (2024) highlight the importance of designing models that are aware of the underlying hardware, which can lead to more efficient and scalable models.\n\n4. **MatMul-Free Computation**:\n   - The approach by Zhu et al. (2024) on MatMul-free language modeling offers a novel way to reduce computational overhead, which can be integrated into the FastTTTLinear model to enhance its efficiency.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n\nTo further enhance the proposal, the researcher should focus on the following:\n\n- **Identify Gaps in Existing Models**:\n  - Search for areas where existing models have not fully integrated hardware-aware optimizations with hierarchical processing and adaptive compression.\n\n- **Recent Innovations**:\n  - Look for the latest research (post-2024) that introduces new methods or improvements in these areas. Updated keywords such as \"Hardware-aware MatMul-free transformers,\" \"Integrated hierarchical hardware-aware language models,\" and \"Adaptive sparse attention with hardware optimization\" can be used for this search.\n\n- **Practical Feasibility**:\n  - Assess the practicality of implementing these advanced techniques within the FastTTTLinear framework, considering potential challenges and solutions.\n\nBy focusing on these areas and leveraging the referenced works, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive language model that outperforms existing state-of-the-art models in terms of efficiency, scalability, and performance.\n",

By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n(1986); Baddeley et al. (1984). Deep Learning has seen a variety of architectures for processing sequential data (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal, 1997, Cho et al., 2014). For example. recurrent neural networks compress information about a sequence into a single hidden state. Transformers get rid of the recurrent state by dynamically capturing information between positions using multi-head dot product attention Vaswani et al. (2017). Transformers have become the dominant architecture across a wide range of domains including vision (Dosovitskiy et al. 2020), natural language (Devlin et al.,\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_f7abbc5aac039e86781bg-02.jpg?height=470&width=813&top_left_y=115&top_left_x=664)\n\nFigure 1: Perceptual module + Temporal Latent Bottleneck Model. $\\mathcal{F}$ denotes the perceptual module or the fast stream which is a Transformer. $\\mathcal{I}$ represents the temporal latent bottleneck state (consisting of a set of vectors) that are updated using a recurrent function denoted by $\\mathcal{G}$. The given sequence is first divided into chunks of size $K$ and each chunk $X_{l}$ is processed by $\\mathcal{F}$ which consists of interleaved SELF AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in blue) and Cross AtTENTION + FFN (denoted in green) layers. The Cross Attention + FFN layers allow the representation of $\\mathcal{F}$ to be conditioned on top-down information from $\\mathcal{I}$. The representations of the temporal latent bottleneck state is updated using the outputs of $\\mathcal{F}$ by a recurrent function $\\mathcal{G}$, which consists of a Cross ATTENTION + FFN layer as shown in the circle. 2018; Radford \\& Narasimhan, 2018, Brown et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022, Chowdhery et al. 2022; Rae et al., 2021), and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021; Janner et al., 2021). They have eclipsed recurrent neural networks (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997, Schuster \\& Paliwal 1997; Cho et al. 2014) in almost all sequence processing domains due to their high representational capacity and scalability. Despite their wide applicability, it is well known that Transformers are very data hungry and work well mainly at scale. This can be attributed to their inductive bias towards modeling all possible pairwise interactions in the sequence which results in no consolidation of information. This lack of selectivity in the attention mechanism also leads to a high computational complexity which scales quadratically with input size. Additionally, modeling all possible pairwise interactions maybe extremely wasteful and may result in capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task (Goyal et al., 2021; Jaegle et al., 2021). The goal of this work is to design an architecture for autoregressive modeling that has an inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representation that retains the benefits of Transformers while preserving long-range interactions. For learning temporally compressed representations, we start by dividing the computation of the Transformer into two streams of processing - a fast stream and a slow stream. Inspired by the idea of long-term and short-term memory, we want the fast stream to have a short-term memory with a high capacity that reacts quickly to sensory input. We refer to this fast stream as the perceptual module and implement it using a Transformer since they are known to have high representational capacity. On the other hand, we want the slow stream to have a long-term memory which updates at a slower rate and summarizes the most important information in the input sequence. We refer to this slow stream as the Temporal Latent Bottleneck. Implementation-wise, we divide the input into fixed size chunks (Figure 1). The fast stream operates within each chunk while the slow stream consolidates and aggregates information across chunks updating itself once per chunk. This leads to information asymmetry between fast and slow stream as the fast stream contains fine-grained local information while the slow stream contains coarse-grained distant information. Such kind of information asymmetry has shown to improve generalization and adaptation performance of learned policies in the context of RL (Goyal et al., 2019a, Galashov et al., 2019). The fast and slow streams interact with each other though bottleneck of attention. The division of computation into a fast and slow stream eliminates the need for capturing all possible pairwise interactions and thus introducing selectivity in the attention mechanism resulting in a much lower computational complexity which is not quadratic in the input size. We show that the limited capacity of the slow stream and consolidation of information by a recurrent neural network prevents the model from capturing unnecessary information not useful for the downstream task. We evaluate the proposed model in a number of domains showing that it consistently outperforms competent baselines showing improved generalization to scenarios not seen during training. ## 2 Methodology\n\nWe now present the proposed approach in detail. Our model jointly leverages the strengths of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) and recurrent neural networks (Cho et al., 2014, Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997). ```\nAlgorithm 1: PyTorch-style pseudocode for proposed model\n    C (query, key, value): CRoss Attention + FFN LAYER\n    \uff5e \\(\\mathcal{S}\\) (query, key, value): SElf AtTEntion + FFN LAYER\n\\# L: Num.\n```\n\n#### 2. Recurrent Attention Networks for Long-text Modeling (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nJunyoung Chung, Caglar Gulcehre, KyungHyun Cho, and Yoshua Bengio. 2014.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.31)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.24)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 17 related papers from 3 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 3 raw search queries input to the search frame: Hierarchical Temporal Bottleneck, Adaptive State Compression, Hierarchical Transformer\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 9 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Temporal Latent Bottleneck: Synthesis of Fast and Slow Processing Mechanisms in Sequence Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Temporal Bottleneck*\n\n*Aniket Didolkar, Kshitij Gupta, Anirudh Goyal, Alex Lamb, Nan Rosemary Ke, Y. Bengio*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed approach hopes to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream and shows the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines.\n\n**Abstract:** Recurrent neural networks have a strong inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as the entire history of a sequence is represented by a single vector. By contrast, Transformers have little inductive bias towards learning temporally compressed representations, as they allow for attention over all previously computed elements in a sequence. Having a more compressed representation of a sequence may be beneficial for generalization, as a high-level representation may be more easily re-used and re-purposed and will contain fewer irrelevant details. At the same time, excessive compression of representations comes at the cost of expressiveness. We propose a solution which divides computation into two streams. A slow stream that is recurrent in nature aims to learn a specialized and compressed representation, by forcing chunks of $K$ time steps into a single representation which is divided into multiple vectors. At the same time, a fast stream is parameterized as a Transformer to process chunks consisting of $K$ time-steps conditioned on the information in the slow-stream. In the proposed approach we hope to gain the expressiveness of the Transformer, while encouraging better compression and structuring of representations in the slow stream. We show the benefits of the proposed method in terms of improved sample efficiency and generalization performance as compared to various competitive baselines for visual perception and sequential decision making tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2.

Haufe*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework within which the spatio-temporal dynamics of model parameters and noise are modeled to have Kronecker product covariance structure and its highly efficient algorithms exploit the intrinsic Riemannian geometry of temporal autocovariance matrices.\n\n**Abstract:** Several problems in neuroimaging and beyond require inference on the parameters of multi-task sparse hierarchical regression models. Examples include M/EEG inverse problems, neural encoding models for task-based fMRI analyses, and climate science. In these domains, both the model parameters to be inferred and the measurement noise may exhibit a complex spatio-temporal structure. Existing work either neglects the temporal structure or leads to computationally demanding inference schemes. Overcoming these limitations, we devise a novel flexible hierarchical Bayesian framework within which the spatio-temporal dynamics of model parameters and noise are modeled to have Kronecker product covariance structure. Inference in our framework is based on majorization-minimization optimization and has guaranteed convergence properties. Our highly efficient algorithms exploit the intrinsic Riemannian geometry of temporal autocovariance matrices. For stationary dynamics described by Toeplitz matrices, the theory of circulant embeddings is employed. We prove convex bounding properties and derive update rules of the resulting algorithms. On both synthetic and real neural data from M/EEG, we demonstrate that our methods lead to improved performance.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

Different from existing knowledge distillation methods for BERT that implicitly learn discriminative student features by mimicking the teacher features, we first introduce a novel contrastive distillation loss (CDL) based on hidden state features in BERT as the explicit supervision to learn discriminative student features. We further observe sentences with similar features may have completely different meanings, which makes them hard to distinguish. Existing methods do not pay sufficient attention to these hard samples with less discriminative features. Therefore, we propose a new strategy called sample adaptive reweighting (SAR) to adaptively pay more attention to these hard samples and strengthen their discrimination abilities. We incorporate our SAR strategy into our CDL and form the adaptive contrastive distillation loss, based on which we construct our ACKD framework. Comprehensive experiments on multiple natural language processing tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our ACKD framework.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Image Shortcut Squeezing: Countering Perturbative Availability Poisons with Compression\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Zhuoran Liu, Zhengyu Zhao, M.

Current research adopts the belief that practical and effective approaches to countering PAPs do not exist. In this paper, we argue that it is time to abandon this belief. We present extensive experiments showing that 12 state-of-the-art PAP methods are vulnerable to Image Shortcut Squeezing (ISS), which is based on simple compression. For example, on average, ISS restores the CIFAR-10 model accuracy to $81.73\\%$, surpassing the previous best preprocessing-based countermeasures by $37.97\\%$ absolute. ISS also (slightly) outperforms adversarial training and has higher generalizability to unseen perturbation norms and also higher efficiency. Our investigation reveals that the property of PAP perturbations depends on the type of surrogate model used for poison generation, and it explains why a specific ISS compression yields the best performance for a specific type of PAP perturbation. We further test stronger, adaptive poisoning, and show it falls short of being an ideal defense against ISS. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of considering various (simple) countermeasures to ensure the meaningfulness of analysis carried out during the development of PAP methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 6. Compression of Generative Pre-trained Language Models via Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Chaofan Tao, Lu Hou, Wei Zhang, Lifeng Shang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Ping Luo, Ngai Wong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper compress generative PLMs by quantization with comparable performance with the full-precision models, and proposes a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules.\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of generative Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) have greatly increased the demand for model compression. Despite various methods to compress BERT or its variants, there are few attempts to compress generative PLMs, and the underlying difficulty remains unclear. In this paper, we compress generative PLMs by quantization. We find that previous quantization methods fail on generative tasks due to the homogeneous word embeddings caused by reduced capacity and the varied distribution of weights. Correspondingly, we propose a token-level contrastive distillation to learn distinguishable word embeddings, and a module-wise dynamic scaling to make quantizers adaptive to different modules. Empirical results on various tasks show that our proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art compression methods on generative PLMs by a clear margin. With comparable performance with the full-precision models, we achieve 14.4x and 13.4x compression rate on GPT-2 and BART, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 88  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 7. History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer for Multi-session Open-domain Dialogue System\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Tong Zhang, Yong Liu, Boyang Albert Li, Zhiwei Zeng, Pengwei Wang, Yuan You, Chun Miao, Li-zhen Cui*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models and human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Abstract:** With the evolution of pre-trained language models, current open-domain dialogue systems have achieved great progress in conducting one-session conversations. In contrast, Multi-Session Conversation (MSC), which consists of multiple sessions over a long term with the same user, is under-investigated. In this paper, we propose History-Aware Hierarchical Transformer (HAHT) for multi-session open-domain dialogue. HAHT maintains a long-term memory of history conversations and utilizes history information to understand current conversation context and generate well-informed and context-relevant responses. Specifically, HAHT first encodes history conversation sessions hierarchically into a history memory. Then, HAHT leverages historical information to facilitate the understanding of the current conversation context by encoding the history memory together with the current context with attention-based mechanisms. Finally, to explicitly utilize historical information, HAHT uses a history-aware response generator that switches between a generic vocabulary and a history-aware vocabulary. Experimental results on a large-scale MSC dataset suggest that the proposed HAHT model consistently outperforms baseline models. Human evaluation results support that HAHT generates more human-like, context-relevant and history-relevant responses than baseline models.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. 3D UX-Net: A Large Kernel Volumetric ConvNet Modernizing Hierarchical Transformer for Medical Image Segmentation\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Ho Hin Lee, Shunxing Bao, Yuankai Huo, Bennett A. Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Multi-hierarchical Independent Correlation Filters for Visual Tracking\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Temporal Bottleneck*\n\n*Ting-Bing Xu, Zhiqun He, Yuan Dong, Hongliang Bai, Zheng Zhu, Shuai Bai*\n\n**Abstract:** For visual tracking, most of the traditional correlation filters (CF) based\nmethods suffer from the bottleneck of feature redundancy and lack of motion\ninformation. In this paper, we design a novel tracking framework, called\nmulti-hierarchical independent correlation filters (MHIT). The framework\nconsists of motion estimation module, hierarchical features selection,\nindependent CF online learning, and adaptive multi-branch CF fusion.\nSpecifically, the motion estimation module is introduced to capture motion\ninformation, which effectively alleviates the object partial occlusion in the\ntemporal video. The multi-hierarchical deep features of CNN representing\ndifferent semantic information can be fully excavated to track multi-scale\nobjects. To better overcome the deep feature redundancy, each hierarchical\nfeatures are independently fed into a single branch to implement the online\nlearning of parameters. Finally, an adaptive weight scheme is integrated into\nthe framework to fuse these independent multi-branch CFs for the better and\nmore robust visual object tracking. Extensive experiments on OTB and VOT\ndatasets show that the proposed MHIT tracker can significantly improve the\ntracking performance. Especially, it obtains a 20.1% relative performance gain\ncompared to the top trackers on the VOT2017 challenge, and also achieves new\nstate-of-the-art performance on the VOT2018 challenge.\n\n**Published:** 2018-11-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. PC-NeRF: Parent-Child Neural Radiance Fields Using Sparse LiDAR Frames in Autonomous Driving Environments\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Temporal Bottleneck*\n\n*Junyi Ma, Yuxuan Han, Peng Jia, Zheng Zang, Guangming Xiong, Xiuzhong Hu*\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis are vital for autonomous vehicles, especially utilizing temporally sparse LiDAR frames. However, conventional explicit representations remain a significant bottleneck towards representing the reconstructed and synthetic scenes at unlimited resolution. Although the recently developed neural radiance fields (NeRF) have shown compelling results in implicit representations, the problem of large-scale 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis using sparse LiDAR frames remains unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a 3D scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis framework called parent-child neural radiance field (PC-NeRF). Based on its two modules, parent NeRF and child NeRF, the framework implements hierarchical spatial partitioning and multi-level scene representation, including scene, segment, and point levels. The multi-level scene representation enhances the efficient utilization of sparse LiDAR point cloud data and enables the rapid acquisition of an approximate volumetric scene representation. With extensive experiments, PC-NeRF is proven to achieve high-precision novel LiDAR view synthesis and 3D reconstruction in large-scale scenes. Moreover, PC-NeRF can effectively handle situations with sparse LiDAR frames and demonstrate high deployment efficiency with limited training epochs. Our approach implementation and the pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/biter0088/pc-nerf.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Maximizing Communication Efficiency for Large-scale Training via 0/1 Adam\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yuxiong He, Christopher De Sa, Minjia Zhang, Conglong Li, Yucheng Lu*\n\n**Abstract:** 1-bit gradient compression and local steps are two representative techniques that enable drastic communication reduction in distributed SGD. Their benefits, however, remain an open question on Adam-based large model pre-training (e.g. BERT and GPT). In this paper, we demonstrate the non-linearity in Adam causes slow convergence even when 1-bit compression or local steps are individually applied. To alleviate this limitation, we propose 0/1 Adam that linearizes each Adam step via approximating its optimizer states using their stale estimates and linear correlation. 0/1 Adam performs an Adam-like step to preserve the adaptivity, while its linearity allows utilizing 1-bit compression and local steps simultaneously for wall-clock time speed up. We provide convergence guarantee for 0/1 Adam on smooth non-convex objectives. On various large-scale benchmarks such as BERT-Base, BERT-Large, GPT-2 pre-training and ImageNet, we demonstrate on up to 128 GPUs that 0/1 Adam is able to reduce up to 87% of data volume, 54% of communication rounds, and achieve up to 2$\\times$ higher training throughput and end-to-end training time reduction compared to the state-of-the-art baseline 1-bit Adam; while enjoying the same statistical convergence speed and end task model accuracy on GLUE dataset and ImageNet validation set.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-12\n\n\n\n#### 4. AdaMV-MoE: Adaptive Multi-Task Vision Mixture-of-Experts\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive State Compression*\n\n*Yeqing Li, Zhangyang Wang, Huizhong Chen, Fan Yang, Abdullah Rashwan, Xianzhi Du, Xuxi Chen, Tianlong Chen*\n\n**Abstract:**     Sparsely activated Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is becoming a promising paradigm for multi-task learning (MTL). Instead of compressing multiple tasks' knowledge into a single model, MoE separates the parameter space and only utilizes the relevant model pieces given task type and its input, which provides stabilized MTL training and ultra-efficient inference. However, current MoE approaches adopt a fixed network capacity (e.g., two experts in usual) for all tasks. It potentially results in the over-fitting of simple tasks or the under-fitting of challenging scenarios, especially when tasks are significantly distinctive in their complexity. In this paper, we propose an adaptive MoE framework for multi-task vision recognition, dubbed AdaMV-MoE. Based on the training dynamics, it automatically determines the number of activated experts for each task, avoiding the laborious manual tuning of optimal model size. To validate our proposal, we benchmark it on ImageNet classification and COCO object detection & instance segmentation which are notoriously difficult to learn in concert, due to their discrepancy. Extensive experiments across a variety of vision transformers demonstrate a superior performance of AdaMV-MoE, compared to MTL with a shared backbone and the recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) MTL MoE approach.

Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Baining Guo, Stephen Lin, Zheng Zhang, Yixuan Wei, Han Hu, Yue Cao, Yutong Lin, Ze Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents a new vision Transformer, called Swin Transformer, that capably serves as a general-purpose backbone for computer vision. Challenges in adapting Transformer from language to vision arise from differences between the two domains, such as large variations in the scale of visual entities and the high resolution of pixels in images compared to words in text. To address these differences, we propose a hierarchical Transformer whose representation is computed with \\textbf{S}hifted \\textbf{win}dows. The shifted windowing scheme brings greater efficiency by limiting self-attention computation to non-overlapping local windows while also allowing for cross-window connection. This hierarchical architecture has the flexibility to model at various scales and has linear computational complexity with respect to image size. These qualities of Swin Transformer make it compatible with a broad range of vision tasks, including image classification (87.3 top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K) and dense prediction tasks such as object detection (58.7 box AP and 51.1 mask AP on COCO test-dev) and semantic segmentation (53.5 mIoU on ADE20K val). Its performance surpasses the previous state-of-the-art by a large margin of +2.7 box AP and +2.6 mask AP on COCO, and +3.2 mIoU on ADE20K, demonstrating the potential of Transformer-based models as vision backbones. The hierarchical design and the shifted window approach also prove beneficial for all-MLP architectures.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hierarchical Transformer*\n\n*Henryk Michalewski, Christian Szegedy, Yuhuai Wu, \u0141ukasz Kaiser, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Szymon Tworkowski, Piotr Nawrot*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-transformers-are-more-efficient-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-26\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that enhances the existing FastTTTLinear model with a hierarchical multi-scale architecture, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hierarchical Processing Structure\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-explored in various domains. For instance, the **HiTime** model described in uses a hierarchical feature encoder to capture diverse aspects of time series data, which could be analogous to capturing local and global dependencies in text data. This model employs dual encoders (data-specific and task-specific) to extract multi-level representations, a strategy that could be adapted for text processing.\n\n## Temporal Latent Bottlenecks\n\n- The idea of using temporal latent bottlenecks for efficient memory management is similar to the concept of multi-scale feature fusion seen in and. In the **EMMA** model, a multi-scale feature fusion (MFF) module combines visual features from intermediate layers to retain fine-grained visual cues. This approach could be translated to text data by compressing and decompressing temporal information to manage long sequences efficiently.\n\n## Adaptive State Compression\n\n- Adaptive state compression is crucial for optimizing memory usage. The **EMMA** model's use of a pixel-wise alignment module and MFF module to preserve structural and fine-grained visual features while mitigating information loss is relevant. Similarly, in text models, adaptive compression could dynamically adjust the level of compression based on the importance of the information, ensuring that essential details are preserved.\n\n## Novelty and Overlap with Existing Work\n\n- The proposal's uniqueness lies in the integration of hierarchical dual-stream architecture, temporal latent bottlenecks, and adaptive state compression specifically within the FastTTTLinear framework. However, there are precedents in other models:\n  - **HiTime** integrates hierarchical feature encoding and semantic space alignment, which could inspire similar hierarchical structures in text models.\n  - **EMMA** addresses the issue of information loss through multi-scale feature fusion, a concept that can be applied to temporal information in text models.\n  - The **Ladderpath approach** discussed in provides a framework for analyzing hierarchical structures in neural networks, which could be used to evaluate the structural complexity and performance of the proposed model.\n\n## Practical Implications\n\n- **Accuracy and Robustness**: Hierarchical processing and temporal latent bottlenecks can improve the model's ability to capture both local and global dependencies, potentially enhancing accuracy and robustness. The **HiTime** model, for example, shows superior performance in time series classification by integrating temporal features.\n- **Efficiency and Scalability**: Adaptive state compression can significantly reduce memory usage and computational overhead, making the model more efficient and scalable. The **EMMA** model's multi-scale feature fusion module demonstrates how such techniques can enhance performance while reducing latency.\n\n## Implementation Feasibility\n\n- **Training Stability**: Integrating these components may introduce challenges in training stability, especially with the addition of adaptive compression mechanisms. Careful tuning of hyperparameters and possibly using techniques like those described in the **Ladderpath approach** to analyze and optimize the hierarchical structure could be beneficial.\n- **Computational Overhead**: The use of hierarchical encoders and adaptive compression may add computational overhead. However, models like **EMMA** and **HiTime** show that with careful design, such overhead can be managed while achieving significant performance improvements.\n\n## Key Insights and References\n\n- **Hierarchical Multi-Scale Representations**: The **HiTime** model's hierarchical feature encoder is a strong example of how to capture diverse aspects of data at multiple scales, which can be adapted for text processing.\n- **Temporal Latent Bottlenecks and Adaptive Compression**: The **EMMA** model's use of multi-scale feature fusion and pixel-wise alignment provides insights into how to manage and preserve fine-grained information, which is crucial for text models handling long sequences.\n- **Analyzing Hierarchical Structures**: The **Ladderpath approach** offers a rigorous method for examining the structural complexity of neural networks, which can be applied to evaluate the proposed model's performance and optimize its architecture.\n\nBy leveraging these insights and references, the researcher can develop a novel autoregressive LM block that significantly enhances the capabilities of the FastTTTLinear model while addressing the challenges of handling long sequences efficiently.\n",

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 227  (*Influential: 41*)\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

Boost Transformer-based Language Models with GPU-Friendly Sparsity and Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Chong Yu, Tao Chen, Zhongxue Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Along with the performance improvement in NLP domain, the sizes of transformer-based language models ( TLM ) are also dramatically increased. Some prior works intend to compress TLM models into more compact forms, but do not fully consider the hardware characters may not support the efficient execution for these forms, leading to the deployment of TLM on hardware with noticeable acceleration is still challenging. This paper thoroughly designs a compression scheme named GPUSQ-TLM to maximally utilize the GPU-friendly 2:4 fine-grained structured sparsity and quantization characters . Especially, a dense TLM model is first pruned to meet the GPU\u2019s acceleration constraint of sparse patterns with FP16 type, then it is further quantized into a fixed-point one by quantization-aware training, to provide an extra speedup for integer tensors on GPU. A mixed-strategy knowledge distillation of labels, logits and feature maps is used for best accuracy compensation during pruning and quantization process. Experiment results show GPUSQ-TLM scheme achieves state-of-the-art compression on TLM model of various encoder and de-coder blocks with negligible accuracy degradation on SQuAD, GLUE, CNN-DM & XSum and WikiText benchmarking tasks. Moreover, GPUSQ-TLM can boost actual deployment performance by up to 4.08-4.25 \u00d7 times latency and 6.18-6.79 \u00d7 throughput on A100 GPU.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Vector-Vector-Matrix Architecture: A Novel Hardware-Aware Framework for Low-Latency Inference in NLP Applications\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Matthew Khoury, Rumen Dangovski, L. Ou, Preslav Nakov, Yichen Shen, L. Jing*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA) is proposed, which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT and reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have become the standard approach to building reliable Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications, ranging from Neural Machine Translation (NMT) to dialogue systems. However, improving accuracy by increasing the model size requires a large number of hardware computations, which can slow down NLP applications significantly at inference time. To address this issue, we propose a novel vector-vector-matrix architecture (VVMA), which greatly reduces the latency at inference time for NMT. This architecture takes advantage of specialized hardware that has low-latency vector-vector operations and higher-latency vector-matrix operations. It also reduces the number of parameters and FLOPs for virtually all models that rely on efficient matrix multipliers without significantly impacting accuracy. We present empirical results suggesting that our framework can reduce the latency of sequence-to-sequence and Transformer models used for NMT by a factor of four. Finally, we show evidence suggesting that our VVMA extends to other domains, and we discuss novel hardware for its efficient use.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. A Hierarchical Spatial Transformer for Massive Point Samples in Continuous Space\n\n*From Search Query: Innovative hierarchical transformer architectures*\n\n*Wenchong He, Zhe Jiang, Tingsong Xiao, Zelin Xu, Shigang Chen, Ronald Fick, Miles Medina, Christine Angelini*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new hierarchical spatial transformer model which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation is proposed, which outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are widely used deep learning architectures. Existing transformers are mostly designed for sequences (texts or time series), images or videos, and graphs. This paper proposes a novel transformer model for massive (up to a million) point samples in continuous space. Such data are ubiquitous in environment sciences (e.g., sensor observations), numerical simulations (e.g., particle-laden flow, astrophysics), and location-based services (e.g., POIs and trajectories). However, designing a transformer for massive spatial points is non-trivial due to several challenges, including implicit long-range and multi-scale dependency on irregular points in continuous space, a non-uniform point distribution, the potential high computational costs of calculating all-pair attention across massive points, and the risks of over-confident predictions due to varying point density. To address these challenges, we propose a new hierarchical spatial transformer model, which includes multi-resolution representation learning within a quad-tree hierarchy and efficient spatial attention via coarse approximation. We also design an uncertainty quantification branch to estimate prediction confidence related to input feature noise and point sparsity. We provide a theoretical analysis of computational time complexity and memory costs. Extensive experiments on both real-world and synthetic datasets show that our method outperforms multiple baselines in prediction accuracy and our model can scale up to one million points on one NVIDIA A100 GPU.

Rethinking Decision Transformer via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Innovative hierarchical transformer architectures*\n\n*Yi Ma, Chenjun Xiao, Hebin Liang, Jianye Hao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of Hierarchical RL, and shows DT emerges as a special case of this framework with certain choices of high-level and low-level policies, and discusses the potential failure of these choices.\n\n**Abstract:** Decision Transformer (DT) is an innovative algorithm leveraging recent advances of the transformer architecture in reinforcement learning (RL). However, a notable limitation of DT is its reliance on recalling trajectories from datasets, losing the capability to seamlessly stitch sub-optimal trajectories together. In this work we introduce a general sequence modeling framework for studying sequential decision making through the lens of Hierarchical RL. At the time of making decisions, a high-level policy first proposes an ideal prompt for the current state, a low-level policy subsequently generates an action conditioned on the given prompt. We show DT emerges as a special case of this framework with certain choices of high-level and low-level policies, and discuss the potential failure of these choices. Inspired by these observations, we study how to jointly optimize the high-level and low-level policies to enable the stitching ability, which further leads to the development of new offline RL algorithms. Our empirical results clearly show that the proposed algorithms significantly surpass DT on several control and navigation benchmarks. We hope our contributions can inspire the integration of transformer architectures within the field of RL.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. HiViT: A Simpler and More Efficient Design of Hierarchical Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Innovative hierarchical transformer architectures*\n\n*Xiaosong Zhang, Yunjie Tian, Lingxi Xie, Wei Huang, Qi Dai, Qixiang Ye, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT, which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning), after pre-trained using masked autoencoder on ImageNet-1K.\n\n**Abstract:** There has been a debate on the choice of plain vs. hierarchical vision transformers, where researchers often believe that the former (e.g., ViT) has a simpler design but the latter (e.g., Swin) enjoys higher recognition accuracy. Recently, the emerge of masked image modeling (MIM), a self-supervised pre-training method, raised a new challenge to vision transformers in terms of flexibility, i.e., part of image patches or tokens are to be discarded, which seems to claim the advantages of plain vision transformers. In this paper, we delve deep into the comparison between ViT and Swin, revealing that (i) the performance gain of Swin is mainly brought by a deepened backbone and relative positional encoding, (ii) the hierarchical design of Swin can be simplified into hierarchical patch embedding (proposed in this work), and (iii) other designs such as shifted-window attentions can be removed. By removing the unnecessary operations, we come up with a new architecture named HiViT (short for hierarchical ViT), which is simpler and more efficient than Swin yet further improves its performance on fully-supervised and self-supervised visual representation learning. In particular, after pre-trained using masked autoencoder (MAE) on ImageNet-1K, HiViT-B reports a 84.6% accuracy on ImageNet-1K classification, a 53.3% box AP on COCO detection, and a 52.8% mIoU on ADE20K segmentation, significantly surpassing the baseline.

HW-GPT-Bench: Hardware-Aware Architecture Benchmark for Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Joerg K. H. Franke, Lennart Purucker, Aaron Klein, Frank Hutter, Benedikt Staffler, Arber Zela, Rhea Sanjay Sukthanker*\n\n**Abstract:** The increasing size of language models necessitates a thorough analysis across multiple dimensions to assess trade-offs among crucial hardware metrics such as latency, energy consumption, GPU memory usage, and performance. Identifying optimal model configurations under specific hardware constraints is becoming essential but remains challenging due to the computational load of exhaustive training and evaluation on multiple devices. To address this, we introduce HW-GPT-Bench, a hardware-aware benchmark that utilizes surrogate predictions to approximate various hardware metrics across 13 devices of architectures in the GPT-2 family, with architectures containing up to 774M parameters. Our surrogates, via calibrated predictions and reliable uncertainty estimates, faithfully model the heteroscedastic noise inherent in the energy and latency measurements. To estimate perplexity, we employ weight-sharing techniques from Neural Architecture Search (NAS), inheriting pretrained weights from the largest GPT-2 model. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of HW-GPT-Bench by simulating optimization trajectories of various multi-objective optimization algorithms in just a few seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. AWQ: Activation-aware Weight Quantization for LLM Compression and Acceleration\n\n*From Search Query: Hardware-aware language models*\n\n*Song Han, Xingyu Dang, Guangxuan Xiao, Wei-Chen Wang, Wei-Ming Chen, Chuang Gan, Shang Yang, Haotian Tang, Jiaming Tang, Ji Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have transformed numerous AI applications. On-device LLM is becoming increasingly important: running LLMs locally on edge devices can reduce the cloud computing cost and protect users' privacy. However, the astronomical model size and the limited hardware resource pose significant deployment challenges. We propose Activation-aware Weight Quantization (AWQ), a hardware-friendly approach for LLM low-bit weight-only quantization. AWQ finds that not all weights in an LLM are equally important. Protecting only 1% salient weights can greatly reduce quantization error. To identify salient weight channels, we should refer to the activation distribution, not weights. To avoid the hardware-inefficient mix-precision quantization, we mathematically derive that scaling up the salient channels can reduce the quantization error. AWQ employs an equivalent transformation to scale the salient weight channels to protect them. The scale is determined by collecting the activation statistics offline. AWQ does not rely on any backpropagation or reconstruction, so it generalizes to different domains and modalities without overfitting the calibration set. AWQ outperforms existing work on various language modeling and domain-specific benchmarks (coding and math). Thanks to better generalization, it achieves excellent quantization performance for instruction-tuned LMs and, for the first time, multi-modal LMs. Alongside AWQ, we implement TinyChat, an efficient and flexible inference framework tailored for 4-bit on-device LLM/VLMs. With kernel fusion and platform-aware weight packing, TinyChat offers more than 3x speedup over the Huggingface FP16 implementation on both desktop and mobile GPUs. It also democratizes the deployment of the 70B Llama-2 model on mobile GPUs.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 3. QKFormer: Hierarchical Spiking Transformer using Q-K Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Innovative hierarchical transformer architectures*\n\n*Yonghong Tian, Huihui Zhou, Zhengyu Ma, Li Yuan, Xiaopeng Fan, Liwei Huang, Liutao Yu, Zhaokun Zhou, Han Zhang, Chenlin Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking Transformers, which integrate Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with Transformer architectures, have attracted significant attention due to their potential for energy efficiency and high performance. However, existing models in this domain still suffer from suboptimal performance. We introduce several innovations to improve the performance: i) We propose a novel spike-form Q-K attention mechanism, tailored for SNNs, which efficiently models the importance of token or channel dimensions through binary vectors with linear complexity. ii) We incorporate the hierarchical structure, which significantly benefits the performance of both the brain and artificial neural networks, into spiking transformers to obtain multi-scale spiking representation. iii) We design a versatile and powerful patch embedding module with a deformed shortcut specifically for spiking transformers. Together, we develop QKFormer, a hierarchical spiking transformer based on Q-K attention with direct training. QKFormer shows significantly superior performance over existing state-of-the-art SNN models on various mainstream datasets. Notably, with comparable size to Spikformer (66.34 M, 74.81%), QKFormer (64.96 M) achieves a groundbreaking top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, substantially outperforming Spikformer by 10.84%. To our best knowledge, this is the first time that directly training SNNs have exceeded 85% accuracy on ImageNet-1K.

Accelerating Scientific Discovery with Generative Knowledge Extraction, Graph-Based Representation, and Multimodal Intelligent Graph Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: Innovative hierarchical transformer architectures*\n\n*Markus J. Buehler*\n\n**Abstract:** Leveraging generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), we have transformed a dataset comprising 1,000 scientific papers into an ontological knowledge graph. Through an in-depth structural analysis, we have calculated node degrees, identified communities and connectivities, and evaluated clustering coefficients and betweenness centrality of pivotal nodes, uncovering fascinating knowledge architectures. The graph has an inherently scale-free nature, is highly connected, and can be used for graph reasoning by taking advantage of transitive and isomorphic properties that reveal unprecedented interdisciplinary relationships that can be used to answer queries, identify gaps in knowledge, propose never-before-seen material designs, and predict material behaviors. We compute deep node embeddings for combinatorial node similarity ranking for use in a path sampling strategy links dissimilar concepts that have previously not been related. One comparison revealed structural parallels between biological materials and Beethoven's 9th Symphony, highlighting shared patterns of complexity through isomorphic mapping. In another example, the algorithm proposed a hierarchical mycelium-based composite based on integrating path sampling with principles extracted from Kandinsky's 'Composition VII' painting. The resulting material integrates an innovative set of concepts that include a balance of chaos/order, adjustable porosity, mechanical strength, and complex patterned chemical functionalization. We uncover other isomorphisms across science, technology and art, revealing a nuanced ontology of immanence that reveal a context-dependent heterarchical interplay of constituents. Graph-based generative AI achieves a far higher degree of novelty, explorative capacity, and technical detail, than conventional approaches and establishes a widely useful framework for innovation by revealing hidden connections.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-18\n\n\n\n#### 5. Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced adaptive compression in transformers*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n#### 6.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/35 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAlbert Gu, Karan Goel, and Christopher R\u00e9. 2021.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

This cost only grows as LLMs scale to larger embedding dimensions and context lengths. In this work, we show that MatMul operations can be completely eliminated from LLMs while maintaining strong performance at billion-parameter scales. Our experiments show that our proposed MatMul-free models achieve performance on-par with state-of-the-art Transformers that require far more memory during inference at a scale up to at least 2.7B parameters. We investigate the scaling laws and find that the performance gap between our MatMul-free models and full precision Transformers narrows as the model size increases. We also provide a GPU-efficient implementation of this model which reduces memory usage by up to 61% over an unoptimized baseline during training. By utilizing an optimized kernel during inference, our model's memory consumption can be reduced by more than 10x compared to unoptimized models. To properly quantify the efficiency of our architecture, we build a custom hardware solution on an FPGA which exploits lightweight operations beyond what GPUs are capable of. We processed billion-parameter scale models at 13W beyond human readable throughput, moving LLMs closer to brain-like efficiency. This work not only shows how far LLMs can be stripped back while still performing effectively, but also points at the types of operations future accelerators should be optimized for in processing the next generation of lightweight LLMs. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ridgerchu/matmulfreellm.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pages 38087-38099.

Existing approaches to address this complexity require additional pretraining or finetuning, and often sacrifice model accuracy. In this paper, we first provide both theoretical and empirical foundations for near-lossless sparse attention. We find dynamically capturing head-specific sparse patterns at runtime with low overhead is crucial. To address this, we propose SampleAttention, an adaptive structured and near-lossless sparse attention. Leveraging observed significant sparse patterns, SampleAttention attends to a fixed percentage of adjacent tokens to capture local window patterns, and employs a two-stage query-guided key-value filtering approach, which adaptively select a minimum set of key-values with low overhead, to capture column stripe patterns. Comprehensive evaluations show that SampleAttention can seamlessly replace vanilla attention in off-the-shelf LLMs with nearly no accuracy loss, and reduces TTFT by up to $2.42\\times$ compared with FlashAttention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/25 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2312.11805, 2023.

SpeedDETR: Speed-aware Transformers for End-to-end Object Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Novel hardware-aware transformers*\n\n*Peiyan Dong, Zhenglun Kong, Xin Meng, P. Zhang, Hao Tang, Yanzhi Wang, Chih-Hsien Chou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes SpeedDETR, a novel speed-aware transformer for end-to-end object detectors, achieving high-speed inference on multiple devices and de-signs a latency prediction model which can directly and accurately estimate the network latency by analyzing network properties, hardware memory access pattern, and degree of parallelism.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformers (ViTs) have continuously achieved new milestones in object detection. However, the considerable computation and memory burden compromise their efficiency and generalization of deployment on resource-constraint devices. Besides, efficient transformer-based detectors designed by existing works can hardly achieve a realistic speedup, especially on multi-core processors (e.g., GPUs). The main issue is that the current literature solely concentrates on building algorithms with minimal computation, oblivious that the practical latency can also be affected by the memory access cost and the degree of parallelism . Therefore, we propose SpeedDETR, a novel speed-aware transformer for end-to-end object detectors, achieving high-speed inference on multiple devices. Specifically, we de-sign a latency prediction model which can directly and accurately estimate the network latency by analyzing network properties , hardware memory access pattern , and degree of parallelism . Following the effective local-to-global visual modeling process and the guidance of the latency prediction model, we build our hardware-oriented architecture design and develop a new family of SpeedDETR. Experiments on the MS COCO dataset show SpeedDETR outperforms current DETR-based methods by 1.5% \u223c 9.2% AP with 1.09 \u00d7\u223c 3.6 \u00d7 speedup on Tesla V100. Even acceptable speed inference can be achieved on edge GPUs, i.e., 4 FPS for NVIDIA JETSON TX2 (1.4 \u00d7\u223c 4 \u00d7 faster than other counterparts), 1 FPS for NVIDIA NANO (1.5 \u00d7\u223c 6.7 \u00d7 faster).

Despite the demonstrated efficacy of transformers in domains including natural language processing and computer vision, their use in hardware design has been limited by the scarcity of offline data. Our approach addresses this limitation by introducing strong inductive biases such as relative positional embeddings and action-permutation symmetricity that effectively capture the hardware context and enable efficient design optimization with limited offline data. We apply DevFoemer to the problem of decoupling capacitor placement and show that it outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both simulated and real hardware, leading to improved performances while reducing the number of components by more than $30\\%$. Finally, we show that our approach achieves promising results in other offline contextual learning-based combinatorial optimization tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. HAT: Hardware-Aware Transformers for Efficient Natural Language Processing\n\n*From Search Query: Novel hardware-aware transformers*\n\n*Hanrui Wang, Zhanghao Wu, Zhijian Liu, Han Cai, Ligeng Zhu, Chuang Gan, Song Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work designs Hardware-Aware Transformers with neural architecture search, and trains a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing, and performs an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are ubiquitous in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but they are difficult to be deployed on hardware due to the intensive computation. To enable low-latency inference on resource-constrained hardware platforms, we propose to design Hardware-Aware Transformers (HAT) with neural architecture search. We first construct a large design space with arbitrary encoder-decoder attention and heterogeneous layers. Then we train a SuperTransformer that covers all candidates in the design space, and efficiently produces many SubTransformers with weight sharing. Finally, we perform an evolutionary search with a hardware latency constraint to find a specialized SubTransformer dedicated to run fast on the target hardware. Extensive experiments on four machine translation tasks demonstrate that HAT can discover efficient models for different hardware (CPU, GPU, IoT device). When running WMT\u201914 translation task on Raspberry Pi-4, HAT can achieve 3\u00d7 speedup, 3.7\u00d7 smaller size over baseline Transformer; 2.7\u00d7 speedup, 3.6\u00d7 smaller size over Evolved Transformer with 12,041\u00d7 less search cost and no performance loss.

MolTC: Towards Molecular Relational Modeling In Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced hierarchical language models*\n\n*Junfeng Fang, Shuai Zhang, Chang Wu, Zhengyi Yang, Zhiyuan Liu, Sihang Li, Kun Wang, Wenjie Du, Xiang Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which effectively integrate graphical information of two molecules in pair is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Molecular Relational Learning (MRL), aiming to understand interactions between molecular pairs, plays a pivotal role in advancing biochemical research. Recently, the adoption of large language models (LLMs), known for their vast knowledge repositories and advanced logical inference capabilities, has emerged as a promising way for efficient and effective MRL. Despite their potential, these methods predominantly rely on the textual data, thus not fully harnessing the wealth of structural information inherent in molecular graphs. Moreover, the absence of a unified framework exacerbates the issue of information underutilization, as it hinders the sharing of interaction mechanism learned across diverse datasets. To address these challenges, this work proposes a novel LLM-based multi-modal framework for Molecular inTeraction prediction following Chain-of-Thought (CoT) theory, termed MolTC, which effectively integrate graphical information of two molecules in pair. To train MolTC efficiently, we introduce a Multi-hierarchical CoT concept to refine its training paradigm, and conduct a comprehensive Molecular Interactive Instructions dataset for the development of biochemical LLMs involving MRL. Our experiments, conducted across various datasets involving over 4,000,000 molecular pairs, exhibit the superiority of our method over current GNN and LLM-based baselines.

HiURE: Hierarchical Exemplar Contrastive Learning for Unsupervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced hierarchical language models*\n\n*Shuliang Liu, Xuming Hu, Chenwei Zhang, Shuang Li, Lijie Wen, Philip S. Yu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE is proposed, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learn.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised relation extraction aims to extract the relationship between entities from natural language sentences without prior information on relational scope or distribution. Existing works either utilize self-supervised schemes to refine relational feature signals by iteratively leveraging adaptive clustering and classification that provoke gradual drift problems, or adopt instance-wise contrastive learning which unreasonably pushes apart those sentence pairs that are semantically similar. To overcome these defects, we propose a novel contrastive learning framework named HiURE, which has the capability to derive hierarchical signals from relational feature space using cross hierarchy attention and effectively optimize relation representation of sentences under exemplar-wise contrastive learning. Experimental results on two public datasets demonstrate the advanced effectiveness and robustness of HiURE on unsupervised relation extraction when compared with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 34  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 7.

We propose a principled, global interaction detection method by casting our target as a multi-arm bandits problem and solving it swiftly with the UCB algorithm. This adaptive method is free of ad-hoc assumptions and among the cutting-edge methods with outstanding detection accuracy and stability. Based on the detection outcome, a lightweight and interpretable deep learning model (called ParaACE) is further built using the alternating conditional expectation (ACE) method. Our proposed ParaACE improves the prediction performance by 26% and reduces the model size by 100+ times as compared to its Teacher model over various datasets.

RSMamba: Remote Sensing Image Classification with State Space Model\n\n*From Search Query: Novel hardware-aware transformers*\n\n*Zhenwei Shi, Zhengxia Zou, Wenyuan Li, Chenyang Liu, Bowen Chen, Keyan Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** Remote sensing image classification forms the foundation of various understanding tasks, serving a crucial function in remote sensing image interpretation. The recent advancements of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers have markedly enhanced classification accuracy. Nonetheless, remote sensing scene classification remains a significant challenge, especially given the complexity and diversity of remote sensing scenarios and the variability of spatiotemporal resolutions. The capacity for whole-image understanding can provide more precise semantic cues for scene discrimination. In this paper, we introduce RSMamba, a novel architecture for remote sensing image classification. RSMamba is based on the State Space Model (SSM) and incorporates an efficient, hardware-aware design known as the Mamba. It integrates the advantages of both a global receptive field and linear modeling complexity. To overcome the limitation of the vanilla Mamba, which can only model causal sequences and is not adaptable to two-dimensional image data, we propose a dynamic multi-path activation mechanism to augment Mamba's capacity to model non-causal data. Notably, RSMamba maintains the inherent modeling mechanism of the vanilla Mamba, yet exhibits superior performance across multiple remote sensing image classification datasets. This indicates that RSMamba holds significant potential to function as the backbone of future visual foundation models. The code will be available at \\url{https://github.com/KyanChen/RSMamba}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-28\n\n\n\n#### 2. TiM4Rec: An Efficient Sequential Recommendation Model Based on Time-Aware Structured State Space Duality Model\n\n*From Search Query: Novel hardware-aware transformers*\n\n*Qingyang Liu, Hongjiu Liu, ZhiJie He, Hailin Feng, Yanrong Hu, Mengyi Zhu, Hao Fan*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential recommendation represents a pivotal branch of recommendation systems, centered around dynamically analyzing the sequential dependencies between user preferences and their interactive behaviors. Despite the Transformer architecture-based models achieving commendable performance within this domain, their quadratic computational complexity relative to the sequence dimension impedes efficient modeling. In response, the innovative Mamba architecture, characterized by linear computational complexity, has emerged. Mamba4Rec further pioneers the application of Mamba in sequential recommendation. Nonetheless, Mamba 1's hardware-aware algorithm struggles to efficiently leverage modern matrix computational units, which lead to the proposal of the improved State Space Duality (SSD), also known as Mamba 2. While the SSD4Rec successfully adapts the SSD architecture for sequential recommendation, showing promising results in high-dimensional contexts, it suffers significant performance drops in low-dimensional scenarios crucial for pure ID sequential recommendation tasks. Addressing this challenge, we propose a novel sequential recommendation backbone model, TiM4Rec, which ameliorates the low-dimensional performance loss of the SSD architecture while preserving its computational efficiency. Drawing inspiration from TiSASRec, we develop a time-aware enhancement method tailored for the linear computation demands of the SSD architecture, thereby enhancing its adaptability and achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in both low and high-dimensional modeling. The code for our model is publicly accessible at https://github.com/AlwaysFHao/TiM4Rec.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. AToMiC: An Image/Text Retrieval Test Collection to Support Multimedia Content Creation\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced hierarchical language models*\n\n*Jimmy Lin, St\u00e9phane Clinchant, Miriam Redi, Krishna Srinivasan, Rafael Sampaio de Rezende, Carlos Lassance, Jheng-Hong Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper presents the AToMiC (Authoring Tools for Multimedia Content) dataset, designed to advance research in image/text cross-modal retrieval. While vision-language pretrained transformers have led to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, existing research has relied on image-caption datasets that feature only simplistic image-text relationships and underspecified user models of retrieval tasks. To address the gap between these oversimplified settings and real-world applications for multimedia content creation, we introduce a new approach for building retrieval test collections. We leverage hierarchical structures and diverse domains of texts, styles, and types of images, as well as large-scale image-document associations embedded in Wikipedia. We formulate two tasks based on a realistic user model and validate our dataset through retrieval experiments using baseline models. AToMiC offers a testbed for scalable, diverse, and reproducible multimedia retrieval research. Finally, the dataset provides the basis for a dedicated track at the 2023 Text Retrieval Conference (TREC), and is publicly available at https://github.com/TREC-AToMiC/AToMiC.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-04\n\n\n\n#### 4. Qwen2-Audio Technical Report\n\n*From Search Query: Advanced hierarchical language models*\n\n*Jingren Zhou, Chang Zhou, Junyang Lin, Jinzheng He, YuanJun Lv, Yichong Leng, Zhifang Guo, Xipin Wei, Haojie Wei, Qian Yang, Jin Xu, Yunfei Chu*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce the latest progress of Qwen-Audio, a large-scale audio-language model called Qwen2-Audio, which is capable of accepting various audio signal inputs and performing audio analysis or direct textual responses with regard to speech instructions. In contrast to complex hierarchical tags, we have simplified the pre-training process by utilizing natural language prompts for different data and tasks, and have further expanded the data volume. We have boosted the instruction-following capability of Qwen2-Audio and implemented two distinct audio interaction modes for voice chat and audio analysis. In the voice chat mode, users can freely engage in voice interactions with Qwen2-Audio without text input. In the audio analysis mode, users could provide audio and text instructions for analysis during the interaction. Note that we do not use any system prompts to switch between voice chat and audio analysis modes. Qwen2-Audio is capable of intelligently comprehending the content within audio and following voice commands to respond appropriately. For instance, in an audio segment that simultaneously contains sounds, multi-speaker conversations, and a voice command, Qwen2-Audio can directly understand the command and provide an interpretation and response to the audio. Additionally, DPO has optimized the model's performance in terms of factuality and adherence to desired behavior. According to the evaluation results from AIR-Bench, Qwen2-Audio outperformed previous SOTAs, such as Gemini-1.5-pro, in tests focused on audio-centric instruction-following capabilities. Qwen2-Audio is open-sourced with the aim of fostering the advancement of the multi-modal language community.\n\n**Published:** 2024-07-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n The researcher's goal is to enhance the **FastTTTLinear** autoregressive language model by incorporating several advanced techniques to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance, particularly in processing long sequences.

The design employs Monarch-inspired structured matrices with optimized memory access patterns and hardware-specific computation paths. This approach significantly reduces memory bandwidth requirements and improves hardware utilization while maintaining model accuracy through careful balance of structure and expressiveness.",
