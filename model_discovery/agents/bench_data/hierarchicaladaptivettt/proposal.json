FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.89)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.89)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Bengio, Greg Mori*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Aaren is introduced, an attention-based module that can not only be trained in parallel but also be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs).\n\n**Abstract:** The advent of Transformers marked a significant breakthrough in sequence modelling, providing a highly performant architecture capable of leveraging GPU parallelism. However, Transformers are computationally expensive at inference time, limiting their applications, particularly in low-resource settings (e.g., mobile and embedded devices). Addressing this, we (1) begin by showing that attention can be viewed as a special Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with the ability to compute its \\textit{many-to-one} RNN output efficiently. We then (2) show that popular attention-based models such as Transformers can be viewed as RNN variants. However, unlike traditional RNNs (e.g., LSTMs), these models cannot be updated efficiently with new tokens, an important property in sequence modelling. Tackling this, we (3) introduce a new efficient method of computing attention's \\textit{many-to-many} RNN output based on the parallel prefix scan algorithm. Building on the new attention formulation, we (4) introduce \\textbf{Aaren}, an attention-based module that can not only (i) be trained in parallel (like Transformers) but also (ii) be updated efficiently with new tokens, requiring only constant memory for inferences (like traditional RNNs). Empirically, we show Aarens achieve comparable performance to Transformers on $38$ datasets spread across four popular sequential problem settings: reinforcement learning, event forecasting, time series classification, and time series forecasting tasks while being more time and memory-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/34 (Score: 0.15)*\n\n```\nO.

Score: 0.10)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.10)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.08)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 30/46 (Score: 0.08)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 32, 2019 .

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 36/51 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415, 2016.

Adaptive Neural Networks for Efficient Inference\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Tolga Bolukbasi, Joseph Wang, O. Dekel, Venkatesh Saligrama*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is shown that computational time can be dramatically reduced by exploiting the fact that many examples can be correctly classified using relatively efficient networks and that complex, computationally costly networks are only necessary for a small fraction of examples.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an approach to adaptively utilize deep neural networks in order to reduce the evaluation time on new examples without loss of accuracy. Rather than attempting to redesign or approximate existing networks, we propose two schemes that adaptively utilize networks. We first pose an adaptive network evaluation scheme, where we learn a system to adaptively choose the components of a deep network to be evaluated for each example. By allowing examples correctly classified using early layers of the system to exit, we avoid the computational time associated with full evaluation of the network. We extend this to learn a network selection system that adaptively selects the network to be evaluated for each example. We show that computational time can be dramatically reduced by exploiting the fact that many examples can be correctly classified using relatively efficient networks and that complex, computationally costly networks are only necessary for a small fraction of examples. We pose a global objective for learning an adaptive early exit or network selection policy and solve it by reducing the policy learning problem to a layer-by-layer weighted binary classification problem. Empirically, these approaches yield dramatic reductions in computational cost, with up to a 2.8x speedup on state-of-the-art networks from the ImageNet image recognition challenge with minimal (<1%) loss of top5 accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 319  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n#### 2. Adaptive Smoothing Gradient Learning for Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Ziming Wang, Runhao Jiang, S. Lian, Rui Yan, Huajin Tang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise, in this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) with biologically inspired spatio-temporal dynamics demonstrate superior energy efficiency on neuromorphic architectures. Error backpropagation in SNNs is pro-hibited by the all-or-none nature of spikes. The existing solution circumvents this problem by a relaxation on the gradient calculation using a continuous function with a constant relaxation degree, so-called surrogate gradient learning. Nevertheless, such a solution introduces additional smoothing error on spike firing which leads to the gradients being estimated inaccurately. Thus, how to adaptively adjust the relaxation degree and eliminate smoothing error progressively is crucial. Here, we propose a methodology such that training a prototype neural network will evolve into training an SNN gradually by fusing the learnable relaxation degree into the network with random spike noise. In this way, the network learns adaptively the accurate gradients of loss landscape in SNNs. The theoretical analysis further shows optimization on such a noisy network could be evolved into optimization on the embedded SNN with shared weights progressively. Moreover, The experiments on static images, dynamic event streams, speech, and instrumental sounds show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance across all the datasets with remarkable robustness on different relaxation degrees.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. ASAM: Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Scale-Invariant Learning of Deep Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Jungmin Kwon, Jeongseop Kim, Hyunseong Park, I. Choi*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), is suggested utilizing the proposed generalization bound, and experimental results show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, learning algorithms motivated from sharpness of loss surface as an effective measure of generalization gap have shown state-of-the-art performances. Nevertheless, sharpness defined in a rigid region with a fixed radius, has a drawback in sensitivity to parameter re-scaling which leaves the loss unaffected, leading to weakening of the connection between sharpness and generalization gap. In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive sharpness which is scale-invariant and propose the corresponding generalization bound. We suggest a novel learning method, adaptive sharpness-aware minimization (ASAM), utilizing the proposed generalization bound. Experimental results in various benchmark datasets show that ASAM contributes to significant improvement of model generalization performance.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 238  (*Influential: 43*)\n\n#### 4. PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*C. Qi, L. Yi, Hao Su, L. Guibas*\n\n**TL;DR:** A hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set and proposes novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly.\n\n**Abstract:** Few prior works study deep learning on point sets. PointNet by Qi et al. is a pioneer in this direction. However, by design PointNet does not capture local structures induced by the metric space points live in, limiting its ability to recognize fine-grained patterns and generalizability to complex scenes. In this work, we introduce a hierarchical neural network that applies PointNet recursively on a nested partitioning of the input point set. By exploiting metric space distances, our network is able to learn local features with increasing contextual scales. With further observation that point sets are usually sampled with varying densities, which results in greatly decreased performance for networks trained on uniform densities, we propose novel set learning layers to adaptively combine features from multiple scales. Experiments show that our network called PointNet++ is able to learn deep point set features efficiently and robustly. In particular, results significantly better than state-of-the-art have been obtained on challenging benchmarks of 3D point clouds.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 9572  (*Influential: 1896*)\n\n#### 5. Point-M2AE: Multi-scale Masked Autoencoders for Hierarchical Point Cloud Pre-training\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Renrui Zhang, Ziyu Guo, Peng Gao, Rongyao Fang, Bingyan Zhao, Dong Wang, Y. Qiao, Hongsheng Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** Point-M2AE is proposed, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds that modifications the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of3D shapes.\n\n**Abstract:** Masked Autoencoders (MAE) have shown great potentials in self-supervised pre-training for language and 2D image transformers. However, it still remains an open question on how to exploit masked autoencoding for learning 3D representations of irregular point clouds. In this paper, we propose Point-M2AE, a strong Multi-scale MAE pre-training framework for hierarchical self-supervised learning of 3D point clouds. Unlike the standard transformer in MAE, we modify the encoder and decoder into pyramid architectures to progressively model spatial geometries and capture both fine-grained and high-level semantics of 3D shapes. For the encoder that downsamples point tokens by stages, we design a multi-scale masking strategy to generate consistent visible regions across scales, and adopt a local spatial self-attention mechanism during fine-tuning to focus on neighboring patterns. By multi-scale token propagation, the lightweight decoder gradually upsamples point tokens with complementary skip connections from the encoder, which further promotes the reconstruction from a global-to-local perspective. Extensive experiments demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of Point-M2AE for 3D representation learning. With a frozen encoder after pre-training, Point-M2AE achieves 92.9% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, even surpassing some fully trained methods. By fine-tuning on downstream tasks, Point-M2AE achieves 86.43% accuracy on ScanObjectNN, +3.36% to the second-best, and largely benefits the few-shot classification, part segmentation and 3D object detection with the hierarchical pre-training scheme.

Kaelbling, Akash Srivastava, Pulkit Agrawal*\n\n**TL;DR:** A foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks and enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** To make effective decisions in novel environments with long-horizon goals, it is crucial to engage in hierarchical reasoning across spatial and temporal scales. This entails planning abstract subgoal sequences, visually reasoning about the underlying plans, and executing actions in accordance with the devised plan through visual-motor control. We propose Compositional Foundation Models for Hierarchical Planning (HiP), a foundation model which leverages multiple expert foundation model trained on language, vision and action data individually jointly together to solve long-horizon tasks. We use a large language model to construct symbolic plans that are grounded in the environment through a large video diffusion model. Generated video plans are then grounded to visual-motor control, through an inverse dynamics model that infers actions from generated videos. To enable effective reasoning within this hierarchy, we enforce consistency between the models via iterative refinement. We illustrate the efficacy and adaptability of our approach in three different long-horizon table-top manipulation tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 40  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 7. DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency.

Bounce: Reliable High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization for Combinatorial and Mixed Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Leonard Papenmeier, Luigi Nardi, Matthias Poloczek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality that reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Impactful applications such as materials discovery, hardware design, neural architecture search, or portfolio optimization require optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions with mixed and combinatorial input spaces. While Bayesian optimization has recently made significant progress in solving such problems, an in-depth analysis reveals that the current state-of-the-art methods are not reliable. Their performances degrade substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. To fill the need for a reliable algorithm for combinatorial and mixed spaces, this paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality. Comprehensive experiments show that Bounce reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Private Language Model Adaptation for Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Zhe Liu, Ke Li, Shreyan Bakshi, Fuchun Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Speech model adaptation is crucial to handle the discrepancy between\nserver-side proxy training data and actual data received on local devices of\nusers. With the use of federated learning (FL), we introduce an efficient\napproach on continuously adapting neural network language models (NNLMs) on\nprivate devices with applications on automatic speech recognition (ASR). To\naddress the potential speech transcription errors in the on-device training\ncorpus, we perform empirical studies on comparing various strategies of\nleveraging token-level confidence scores to improve the NNLM quality in the FL\nsettings. Experiments show that compared with no model adaptation, the proposed\nmethod achieves relative 2.6% and 10.8% word error rate (WER) reductions on two\nspeech evaluation datasets, respectively. We also provide analysis in\nevaluating privacy guarantees of our presented procedure.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-28T00:15:43Z  (*Updated: 2022-06-15T04:00:47Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Leveraging Deep Neural Network Activation Entropy to cope with Unseen\n  Data in Speech Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Vikramjit Mitra, Horacio Franco*\n\n**Abstract:** Unseen data conditions can inflict serious performance degradation on systems\nrelying on supervised machine learning algorithms. Because data can often be\nunseen, and because traditional machine learning algorithms are trained in a\nsupervised manner, unsupervised adaptation techniques must be used to adapt the\nmodel to the unseen data conditions. However, unsupervised adaptation is often\nchallenging, as one must generate some hypothesis given a model and then use\nthat hypothesis to bootstrap the model to the unseen data conditions.\nUnfortunately, reliability of such hypotheses is often poor, given the mismatch\nbetween the training and testing datasets. In such cases, a model hypothesis\nconfidence measure enables performing data selection for the model adaptation.\nUnderlying this approach is the fact that for unseen data conditions, data\nvariability is introduced to the model, which the model propagates to its\noutput decision, impacting decision reliability. In a fully connected network,\nthis data variability is propagated as distortions from one layer to the next.\nThis work aims to estimate the propagation of such distortion in the form of\nnetwork activation entropy, which is measured over a short- time running window\non the activation from each neuron of a given hidden layer, and these\nmeasurements are then used to compute summary entropy. This work demonstrates\nthat such an entropy measure can help to select data for unsupervised model\nadaptation, resulting in performance gains in speech recognition tasks. Results\nfrom standard benchmark speech recognition tasks show that the proposed\napproach can alleviate the performance degradation experienced under unseen\ndata conditions by iteratively adapting the model to the unseen datas acoustic\ncondition.\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-31T01:00:19Z  (*Updated: 2017-08-31T01:00:19Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. R2D2: Recursive Transformer based on Differentiable Tree for\n  Interpretable Hierarchical Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Xiang Hu, Haitao Mi, Zujie Wen, Yafang Wang, Yi Su, Jing Zheng, Gerard de Melo*\n\n**Abstract:** Human language understanding operates at multiple levels of granularity\n(e.g., words, phrases, and sentences) with increasing levels of abstraction\nthat can be hierarchically combined. However, existing deep models with stacked\nlayers do not explicitly model any sort of hierarchical process. This paper\nproposes a recursive Transformer model based on differentiable CKY style binary\ntrees to emulate the composition process. We extend the bidirectional language\nmodel pre-training objective to this architecture, attempting to predict each\nword given its left and right abstraction nodes. To scale up our approach, we\nalso introduce an efficient pruned tree induction algorithm to enable encoding\nin just a linear number of composition steps. Experimental results on language\nmodeling and unsupervised parsing show the effectiveness of our approach.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-02T11:00:46Z  (*Updated: 2022-03-03T05:22:59Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Injecting Hierarchy with U-Net Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*David Donahue, Vladislav Lialin, Anna Rumshisky*\n\n**Abstract:** The Transformer architecture has become increasingly popular over the past\ntwo years, owing to its impressive performance on a number of natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tasks. However, all Transformer computations occur at the\nlevel of word representations and therefore, it may be argued that Transformer\nmodels do not explicitly attempt to learn hierarchical structure which is\nwidely assumed to be integral to language. In the present work, we introduce\nhierarchical processing into the Transformer model, taking inspiration from the\nU-Net architecture, popular in computer vision for its hierarchical view of\nnatural images. We empirically demonstrate that the proposed architecture\noutperforms both the vanilla Transformer and some strong baselines in the\ndomain of chit-chat dialogue.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-16T15:48:46Z  (*Updated: 2021-04-01T19:41:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 5.

Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive neural networks*\n\n*Alex Graves*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces Adaptive Computation Time (ACT), an algorithm that\nallows recurrent neural networks to learn how many computational steps to take\nbetween receiving an input and emitting an output. ACT requires minimal changes\nto the network architecture, is deterministic and differentiable, and does not\nadd any noise to the parameter gradients.

Hierarchical Neural Memory Network for Low Latency Event Processing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical processing*\n\n*Ken Sakurada, Masaki Onishi, Yasutaka Furukawa, Ryuhei Hamaguchi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes a low latency neural network architecture for event-based dense prediction tasks. Conventional architectures encode entire scene contents at a fixed rate regardless of their temporal characteristics. Instead, the proposed network encodes contents at a proper temporal scale depending on its movement speed. We achieve this by constructing temporal hierarchy using stacked latent memories that operate at different rates. Given low latency event steams, the multi-level memories gradually extract dynamic to static scene contents by propagating information from the fast to the slow memory modules. The architecture not only reduces the redundancy of conventional architectures but also exploits long-term dependencies. Furthermore, an attention-based event representation efficiently encodes sparse event streams into the memory cells. We conduct extensive evaluations on three event-based dense prediction tasks, where the proposed approach outperforms the existing methods on accuracy and latency, while demonstrating effective event and image fusion capabilities.

Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Sergey Levine, Kevin Swersky, Milad Hashemi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Aviral Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a \"simulation-driven\" approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a \"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Conference:** data-driven-offline-optimization-for\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficient and Modular Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Jean-Philippe Vert, Fabian Pedregosa, Felipe Llinares-L\u00f3pez, Stephan Hoyer, Roy Frostig, Marco Cuturi, Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel*\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.\n\n**Conference:** efficient-and-modular-implicit-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with a focus on adaptive computation, hierarchical processing, and hardware optimization, here are some key techniques and insights that can be leveraged:\n\n## Methods for Content-Dependent Processing\n\n### Adaptive Mechanisms\n- Incorporating content-dependent mechanisms, such as those discussed in the context of State Space Models (SSMs), can enhance the adaptivity of the model. For instance, SSMs can be designed with data-dependent generalization bounds, showing an interplay between the model parameters and temporal dependencies. This approach can be integrated into autoregressive LMs to make them more adaptive to different input patterns.\n\n### Meta-Learning and Transfer Learning\n- Techniques like meta-learning (or \"learning to learn\") can be applied to optimize the learning algorithms of the LM, allowing it to adapt better to new tasks or changing environments. This can be particularly useful in autoregressive models where the ability to learn from one task and apply it to another is crucial.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Hierarchical Architectures\n\n### Hierarchical Matrix Structures\n- The H-Transformer-1D architecture provides a promising approach by exploiting a matrix structure similar to the Hierarchical Matrix developed by the numerical analysis community. This structure achieves linear run time and memory complexity, making it highly efficient for hierarchical processing.\n\n### Block-Level Processing\n- Block-Recurrent Transformers demonstrate the benefits of processing blocks of tokens rather than single tokens. This approach maintains linear complexity with respect to sequence length and can be integrated into hierarchical architectures to enhance efficiency.\n\n## Hardware-Aware Optimization Strategies\n\n### Efficient State Management\n- To achieve memory efficiency, selective state updates based on content relevance can be implemented. This involves managing the state space effectively, ensuring that only relevant information is updated, which can be particularly beneficial in hardware-constrained environments.\n\n### Hardware-Friendly Implementations\n- Designing models with hardware-aware optimization in mind is crucial. Techniques such as using residual learning, as seen in ResNet architectures, can help in training very deep networks efficiently. Additionally, leveraging parallel computation capabilities of modern hardware can significantly improve the performance of block-level processing models.\n\n### Adaptive Convolutional Neural Networks\n- Although primarily discussed in the context of image super-resolution, the concept of adaptive convolutional neural networks (like ADSRNet) can provide insights into how to dynamically adjust parameters based on input information. This adaptability can be translated to autoregressive LMs by incorporating similar dynamic convolution mechanisms to enhance their robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Key Insights and Integration\n\n### Hybrid Architectures\n- Combining different architectural elements, such as block-level processing, hierarchical attention, and content-dependent mechanisms, can address the limitations of individual approaches. Hybrid architectures can leverage the strengths of various models to achieve better adaptivity, efficiency, and scalability.\n\n### Linear Complexity and Scalability\n- Maintaining linear complexity is essential for practical scalability. Techniques like the H-Transformer-1D and Block-Recurrent Transformers ensure that the model's complexity remains linear with respect to sequence length, which is critical for large-scale language models.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are highly adaptive, memory-efficient, and optimized for hardware performance, thereby achieving better overall performance with more data and larger models.\n",

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative. The modification we propose is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\text { modified }(Q, K, V):= \\\\\n\\text { Attention }(Q) \\\\\n\\text { Softmax }\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere queries $Q$, keys $K$ and values $V$ have $n_{Q} \\times d_{K}, n_{K} \\times d_{K}$, and $n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements, respectively, and $c$ is a scalar constant, all in $\\mathbb{R}$. We compute all exponentials elementwise. ### 1.2 As Log-Sums of Exponentials\n\nIn Section 2, we prove that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\text { modified } \\\\\n& \\operatorname{Attention}(Q, K, V)=\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z) \\text {, }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe elementwise sums are over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over all other dimensions, from left to right-e.g., before reduction, the broadcasted elementwise sum $K^{T}+\\log V$ has $d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V}$ elements. The functions $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ and $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ compute log-sums of exponentials over the dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, d_{K}\\right)$ and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, respectively. If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5.

This is in contrast with the frequently stated belief that self-attention requires $O(n^2)$ memory. While the time complexity is still $O(n^2)$, device memory rather than compute capability is often the limiting factor on modern accelerators. Thus, reducing the memory requirements of attention allows processing of longer sequences than might otherwise be feasible. We provide a practical implementation for accelerators that requires $O(\\sqrt{n})$ memory, is numerically stable, and is within a few percent of the runtime of the standard implementation of attention. We also demonstrate how to differentiate the function while remaining memory-efficient. For sequence length 16384, the memory overhead of self-attention is reduced by 59X for inference and by 32X for differentiation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/12 (Score: 0.49)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.01540, 2021.

Efficient Representation Learning via Adaptive Context Pooling\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Chen Huang, Walter A. Talbott, N. Jaitly, J. Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, this paper learns to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer, and makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Self-attention mechanisms model long-range context by using pairwise attention between all input tokens. In doing so, they assume a fixed attention granularity defined by the individual tokens (e.g., text characters or image pixels), which may not be optimal for modeling complex dependencies at higher levels. In this paper, we propose ContextPool to address this problem by adapting the attention granularity for each token. Inspired by the success of ConvNets that are combined with pooling to capture long-range dependencies, we learn to pool neighboring features for each token before computing attention in a given attention layer. The pooling weights and support size are adaptively determined, allowing the pooled features to encode meaningful context with varying scale. We show that ContextPool makes attention models more expressive, achieving strong performance often with fewer layers and thus significantly reduced cost. Experiments validate that our ContextPool module, when plugged into transformer models, matches or surpasses state-of-the-art performance using less compute on several language and image benchmarks, outperforms recent works with learned context sizes or sparse attention patterns, and is also applicable to ConvNets for efficient feature learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale.

However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7. Outliers with Opposing Signals Have an Outsized Effect on Neural Network Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network optimization*\n\n*Elan Rosenfeld, Andrej Risteski*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new phenomenon in neural network optimization which arises from the interaction of depth and a particular heavy-tailed structure in natural data is identified, offering intuitive explanations for several previously reported observations about network training dynamics and enabling new qualitative predictions of training behavior.\n\n**Abstract:** We identify a new phenomenon in neural network optimization which arises from the interaction of depth and a particular heavy-tailed structure in natural data. Our result offers intuitive explanations for several previously reported observations about network training dynamics. In particular, it implies a conceptually new cause for progressive sharpening and the edge of stability; we also highlight connections to other concepts in optimization and generalization including grokking, simplicity bias, and Sharpness-Aware Minimization. Experimentally, we demonstrate the significant influence of paired groups of outliers in the training data with strong opposing signals: consistent, large magnitude features which dominate the network output throughout training and provide gradients which point in opposite directions. Due to these outliers, early optimization enters a narrow valley which carefully balances the opposing groups; subsequent sharpening causes their loss to rise rapidly, oscillating between high on one group and then the other, until the overall loss spikes. We describe how to identify these groups, explore what sets them apart, and carefully study their effect on the network's optimization and behavior. We complement these experiments with a mechanistic explanation on a toy example of opposing signals and a theoretical analysis of a two-layer linear network on a simple model. Our finding enables new qualitative predictions of training behavior which we confirm experimentally. It also provides a new lens through which to study and improve modern training practices for stochastic optimization, which we highlight via a case study of Adam versus SGD.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Particle Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent: Exponential convergent algorithm for mean field neural network optimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network optimization*\n\n*Kazusato Oko, Taiji Suzuki, Atsushi Nitanda, Denny Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Particle-SDCA is introduced, a gradient-based optimization algorithm for two-layer neural networks in the mean field regime that achieves exponential convergence rate in regularized empirical risk minimization and exploits the convexity of the dual problem.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Particle-SDCA, a gradient-based optimization algorithm for two-layer neural networks in the mean field regime that achieves exponential convergence rate in regularized empirical risk minimization. The proposed algorithm can be regarded as an infinite dimensional extension of Stochastic Dual Coordinate Ascent (SDCA) in the probability space: we exploit the convexity of the dual problem, for which the coordinate-wise proximal gradient method can be applied. Our proposed method inherits advantages of the original SDCA, including (i) exponential convergence (with respect to the outer iteration steps), and (ii) better dependency on the sample size and condition number than the full-batch gradient method. One technical challenge in implementing the SDCA update is the intractable integral over the entire parameter space at every step. To overcome this limitation, we propose a tractable particle method that approximately solves the dual problem, and an importance re-weighting technique to reduce the computational cost. The convergence rate of our method is verified by numerical experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 9. Nondeterminism and Instability in Neural Network Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network optimization*\n\n*Cecilia Summers, M. Dinneen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Surprisingly, it is found that all sources of nondeterminism have similar effects on measures of model diversity, and it is shown that even one-bit changes in initial parameters result in models converging to vastly different values.\n\n**Abstract:** Nondeterminism in neural network optimization produces uncertainty in performance, making small improvements difficult to discern from run-to-run variability. While uncertainty can be reduced by training multiple model copies, doing so is time-consuming, costly, and harms reproducibility. In this work, we establish an experimental protocol for understanding the effect of optimization nondeterminism on model diversity, allowing us to isolate the effects of a variety of sources of nondeterminism. Surprisingly, we find that all sources of nondeterminism have similar effects on measures of model diversity. To explain this intriguing fact, we identify the instability of model training, taken as an end-to-end procedure, as the key determinant. We show that even one-bit changes in initial parameters result in models converging to vastly different values. Last, we propose two approaches for reducing the effects of instability on run-to-run variability.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Explain and Improve: LRP-Inference Fine-Tuning for Image Captioning\n  Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamei Sun, Sebastian Lapuschkin, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper analyzes the predictions of image captioning models with attention\nmechanisms beyond visualizing the attention itself. We develop variants of\nlayer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) and gradient-based explanation methods,\ntailored to image captioning models with attention mechanisms. We compare the\ninterpretability of attention heatmaps systematically against the explanations\nprovided by explanation methods such as LRP, Grad-CAM, and Guided Grad-CAM. We\nshow that explanation methods provide simultaneously pixel-wise image\nexplanations (supporting and opposing pixels of the input image) and linguistic\nexplanations (supporting and opposing words of the preceding sequence) for each\nword in the predicted captions. We demonstrate with extensive experiments that\nexplanation methods 1) can reveal additional evidence used by the model to make\ndecisions compared to attention; 2) correlate to object locations with high\nprecision; 3) are helpful to \"debug\" the model, e.g. by analyzing the reasons\nfor hallucinated object words. With the observed properties of explanations, we\nfurther design an LRP-inference fine-tuning strategy that reduces the issue of\nobject hallucination in image captioning models, and meanwhile, maintains the\nsentence fluency.

Efficient Second-Order Neural Network Optimization via Adaptive Trust\n  Region Methods\n\n*From Search Query: neural network optimization*\n\n*James Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Second-order optimization methods offer notable advantages in training deep\nneural networks by utilizing curvature information to achieve faster\nconvergence. However, traditional second-order techniques are computationally\nprohibitive, primarily due to the large matrix inversions and high memory\ndemands they require. While adaptive trust-region methods have been developed\nto mitigate these issues, their performance is often hindered by conservative\nestimates of key parameters, such as the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian,\nresulting in suboptimal outcomes. In this paper, we introduce\nSecondOrderAdaptiveAdam (SOAA), a novel optimization algorithm designed to\novercome these limitations. SOAA approximates the Fisher information matrix\nusing a diagonal representation, reducing computational complexity from\n\\(O(n^{2})\\) to \\(O(n)\\), thereby making it suitable for large-scale deep\nlearning models, including large language models (LLMs). Additionally, the\nalgorithm integrates an adaptive trust-region mechanism that dynamically\nadjusts the trust region size based on observed loss reduction, ensuring both\nrobust convergence and computational efficiency. We empirically demonstrate\nthat SOAA achieves faster and more stable convergence compared to first-order\noptimizers, such as Adam, under similar computational constraints. However, the\ndiagonal approximation of the Fisher information matrix may be less effective\nin capturing higher-order interactions between gradients, suggesting potential\nareas for further refinement and future research.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-03T08:23:06Z  (*Updated: 2024-10-03T08:23:06Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning Inductive Biases with Simple Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: neural network optimization*\n\n*Reuben Feinman, Brenden M. Lake*\n\n**Abstract:** People use rich prior knowledge about the world in order to efficiently learn\nnew concepts. These priors - also known as \"inductive biases\" - pertain to the\nspace of internal models considered by a learner, and they help the learner\nmake inferences that go beyond the observed data. A recent study found that\ndeep neural networks optimized for object recognition develop the shape bias\n(Ritter et al., 2017), an inductive bias possessed by children that plays an\nimportant role in early word learning. However, these networks use\nunrealistically large quantities of training data, and the conditions required\nfor these biases to develop are not well understood. Moreover, it is unclear\nhow the learning dynamics of these networks relate to developmental processes\nin childhood. We investigate the development and influence of the shape bias in\nneural networks using controlled datasets of abstract patterns and synthetic\nimages, allowing us to systematically vary the quantity and form of the\nexperience provided to the learning algorithms. We find that simple neural\nnetworks develop a shape bias after seeing as few as 3 examples of 4 object\ncategories. The development of these biases predicts the onset of vocabulary\nacceleration in our networks, consistent with the developmental process in\nchildren.\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-08T08:25:51Z  (*Updated: 2018-06-13T18:01:21Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. AOE-Net: Entities Interactions Modeling with Adaptive Attention Mechanism for Temporal Action Proposals Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms*\n\n*Ngan Le, Minh-Triet Tran, Bhiksha Raj, Kashu Yamazaki, Sang Truong, Khoa Vo*\n\n**Abstract:** Temporal action proposal generation (TAPG) is a challenging task, which requires localizing action intervals in an untrimmed video. Intuitively, we as humans, perceive an action through the interactions between actors, relevant objects, and the surrounding environment. Despite the significant progress of TAPG, a vast majority of existing methods ignore the aforementioned principle of the human perceiving process by applying a backbone network into a given video as a black-box. In this paper, we propose to model these interactions with a multi-modal representation network, namely, Actors-Objects-Environment Interaction Network (AOE-Net). Our AOE-Net consists of two modules, i.e., perception-based multi-modal representation (PMR) and boundary-matching module (BMM). Additionally, we introduce adaptive attention mechanism (AAM) in PMR to focus only on main actors (or relevant objects) and model the relationships among them. PMR module represents each video snippet by a visual-linguistic feature, in which main actors and surrounding environment are represented by visual information, whereas relevant objects are depicted by linguistic features through an image-text model. BMM module processes the sequence of visual-linguistic features as its input and generates action proposals. Comprehensive experiments and extensive ablation studies on ActivityNet-1.3 and THUMOS-14 datasets show that our proposed AOE-Net outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods with remarkable performance and generalization for both TAPG and temporal action detection. To prove the robustness and effectiveness of AOE-Net, we further conduct an ablation study on egocentric videos, i.e. EPIC-KITCHENS 100 dataset.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 4.

An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures.

Blaschko, Maxim Berman*\n\n**Abstract:** The Jaccard index, also referred to as the intersection-over-union score, is commonly employed in the evaluation of image segmentation results given its perceptual qualities, scale invariance - which lends appropriate relevance to small objects, and appropriate counting of false negatives, in comparison to per-pixel losses. We present a method for direct optimization of the mean intersection-over-union loss in neural networks, in the context of semantic image segmentation, based on the convex Lov\u00c3\u00a1sz extension of submodular losses. The loss is shown to perform better with respect to the Jaccard index measure than the traditionally used cross-entropy loss. We show quantitative and qualitative differences between optimizing the Jaccard index per image versus optimizing the Jaccard index taken over an entire dataset. We evaluate the impact of our method in a semantic segmentation pipeline and show substantially improved intersection-over-union segmentation scores on the Pascal VOC and Cityscapes datasets using state-of-the-art deep learning segmentation architectures.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2018-6\n\n**Published:** 2018-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 6.

This operator reduces information redundancy and optimizes information exchange, which could be beneficial in balancing computational resources based on input complexity.\n- **Content-Dependent Computation**: Models like FlashAttention and DepthShrinker highlight the importance of content-dependent computation. This approach can be adapted to autoregressive models by dynamically adjusting the attention mechanism based on the input sequence complexity, ensuring efficient allocation of computational resources.\n\n### Techniques for Efficient Attention Computation\n- **Block-Level Processing**: The Block-Recurrent Transformers approach, which applies transformer layers in a recurrent fashion on blocks of tokens, can be integrated into autoregressive models. This method maintains efficiency while enabling parallel computation, which is crucial for large-scale language models.\n- **Hierarchical Attention**: The H-Transformer-1D model's hierarchical matrix structure can be adapted to autoregressive models. This structure allows for linear run time and memory complexity, making it more efficient for processing long sequences.\n\n## Efficient State Representation and Update\n\n### Memory Efficiency and Selective State Updates\n- **IO-Aware Algorithms**: FlashAttention's IO-aware design can be applied to reduce the number of memory reads/writes, which is essential for efficient state updates in autoregressive models. This approach ensures that the model can handle large sequences without significant memory overhead.\n- **Selective State Updates**: Techniques from DepthShrinker, which focus on real-hardware efficient DNNs, can be used to optimize state updates. By selectively updating states, the model can reduce memory usage and improve performance.\n\n## Approaches for Optimizing Attention Computation on Hardware\n\n### Hardware-Aware Design\n- **Hardware-Aware Principles**: The design of autoregressive models should be guided by hardware-aware principles, as emphasized by DepthShrinker. This includes optimizing for memory efficiency, IO-awareness, and leveraging hardware capabilities to enhance performance.\n- **Meta-Learning Approaches**: Incorporating meta-learning approaches can enhance the adaptability of the model across different contexts and hardware configurations. This can help in optimizing the model for various deployment scenarios.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Feature Importance and Attention\n- The use of attention mechanisms to identify the most relevant features, as seen in the sTAB-Net model, can be applied to autoregressive language models. This helps in focusing computational resources on the most important input features, thereby improving efficiency and performance.\n\n### Hierarchical and Multi-Scale Processing\n- Hierarchical processing, as in H-Transformer-1D, can be combined with adaptive computation to capture dependencies at different levels. This multi-scale approach can enhance the model's ability to handle complex sequences efficiently.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, adaptive, and optimized for both computational resources and hardware capabilities. This would help in achieving lower perplexity, higher accuracy in downstream tasks, robustness to variant inputs, and better scalability.\n",

These models allow efficient processing of long sequences in linear time and are rapidly being adopted in a wide range of applications such as language modeling, demonstrating promising performance. To foster their reliable use in real-world scenarios, it is crucial to augment their transparency. Our work bridges this critical gap by bringing explainability, particularly Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP), to the Mamba architecture. Guided by the axiom of relevance conservation, we identify specific components in the Mamba architecture, which cause unfaithful explanations. To remedy this issue, we propose MambaLRP, a novel algorithm within the LRP framework, which ensures a more stable and reliable relevance propagation through these components. Our proposed method is theoretically sound and excels in achieving state-of-the-art explanation performance across a diverse range of models and datasets. Moreover, MambaLRP facilitates a deeper inspection of Mamba architectures, uncovering various biases and evaluating their significance. It also enables the analysis of previous speculations regarding the long-range capabilities of Mamba models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 35/59 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv:2401.04722, 2024. [40] H.

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.14)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.14)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Efficient Beam Tree Recursion (Avg. Score: 0.12)\n\n*Jishnu Ray Chowdhury, Cornelia Caragea*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** These proposals standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n**Abstract:** Beam Tree Recursive Neural Network (BT-RvNN) was recently proposed as a simple extension of Gumbel Tree RvNN and it was shown to achieve state-of-the-art length generalization performance in ListOps while maintaining comparable performance on other tasks. However, although not the worst in its kind, BT-RvNN can be still exorbitantly expensive in memory usage. In this paper, we identify the main bottleneck in BT-RvNN's memory usage to be the entanglement of the scorer function and the recursive cell function. We propose strategies to remove this bottleneck and further simplify its memory usage. Overall, our strategies not only reduce the memory usage of BT-RvNN by $10$-$16$ times but also create a new state-of-the-art in ListOps while maintaining similar performance in other tasks. In addition, we also propose a strategy to utilize the induced latent-tree node representations produced by BT-RvNN to turn BT-RvNN from a sentence encoder of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d}$ into a sequence contextualizer of the form $f:\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$. Thus, our proposals not only open up a path for further scalability of RvNNs but also standardize a way to use BT-RvNNs as another building block in the deep learning toolkit that can be easily stacked or interfaced with other popular models such as Transformers and Structured State Space models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/50 (Score: 0.12)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of International Conference on Neural Networks (ICNN'96), volume 1, pages 347-352 vol.1, 1996. doi: 10.1109/ICNN.1996.548916.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

These new tree models have allowed for improvements in sentiment analysis and semantic recognition. Here we review the Ordered Memory model proposed by Shen et al.

Efficient Classification of Long Documents via State-Space Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Peng Lu, Suyuchen Wang, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Bang Liu, I.

However, long documents which are prevalent in real-world scenarios cannot be efficiently processed by transformers with the vanilla self-attention module due to their quadratic computation complexity and limited length extrapolation ability. Instead of tack-ling the computation difficulty for self-attention with sparse or hierarchical structures, in this paper, we investigate the use of State-Space Models (SSMs) for long document classification tasks. We conducted extensive experiments on six long document classification datasets, including binary, multi-class, and multi-label classification, comparing SSMs (with and without pre-training) to self-attention-based models. We also introduce the SSM-pooler model and demonstrate that it achieves comparable performance while being on average 36% more efficient. Additionally our method exhibits higher robustness to the input noise even in the extreme scenario of 40%.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. LightGBM: A Highly Efficient Gradient Boosting Decision Tree\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Guolin Ke, Qi Meng, Thomas Finley, Taifeng Wang, Wei Chen, Weidong Ma, Qiwei Ye, Tie-Yan Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) is a popular machine learning algorithm, and has quite a few effective implementations such as XGBoost and pGBRT. Although many engineering optimizations have been adopted in these implementations, the efficiency and scalability are still unsatisfactory when the feature dimension is high and data size is large. A major reason is that for each feature, they need to scan all the data instances to estimate the information gain of all possible split points, which is very time consuming. To tackle this problem, we propose two novel techniques: \\emph{Gradient-based One-Side Sampling} (GOSS) and \\emph{Exclusive Feature Bundling} (EFB). With GOSS, we exclude a significant proportion of data instances with small gradients, and only use the rest to estimate the information gain. We prove that, since the data instances with larger gradients play a more important role in the computation of information gain, GOSS can obtain quite accurate estimation of the information gain with a much smaller data size. With EFB, we bundle mutually exclusive features (i.e., they rarely take nonzero values simultaneously), to reduce the number of features. We prove that finding the optimal bundling of exclusive features is NP-hard, but a greedy algorithm can achieve quite good approximation ratio (and thus can effectively reduce the number of features without hurting the accuracy of split point determination by much). We call our new GBDT implementation with GOSS and EFB \\emph{LightGBM}. Our experiments on multiple public datasets show that, LightGBM speeds up the training process of conventional GBDT by up to over 20 times while achieving almost the same accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 8744  (*Influential: 936*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Gradient Computation for Structured Output Learning with Rational and Tropical Losses\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Corinna Cortes, Vitaly Kuznetsov, M. Mohri, Dmitry Storcheus, Scott Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** Efficient gradient computation algorithms for two broad families of structured prediction loss functions: rational and tropical losses are designed that facilitate efficient gradient computation and enable one to train learning models such as neural networks with complex structured losses.\n\n**Abstract:** Many structured prediction problems admit a natural loss function for evaluation such as the edit-distance or $n$-gram loss. However, existing learning algorithms are typically designed to optimize alternative objectives such as the cross-entropy. This is because a na\\\"{i}ve implementation of the natural loss functions often results in intractable gradient computations. In this paper, we design efficient gradient computation algorithms for two broad families of structured prediction loss functions: rational and tropical losses. These families include as special cases the $n$-gram loss, the edit-distance loss, and many other loss functions commonly used in natural language processing and computational biology tasks that are based on sequence similarity measures. Our algorithms make use of weighted automata and graph operations over appropriate semirings to design efficient solutions. They facilitate efficient gradient computation and hence enable one to train learning models such as neural networks with complex structured losses.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5.

We unite the two via adaptive neural trees (ANTs) that incorporates representation learning into edges, routing functions and leaf nodes of a decision tree, along with a backpropagation-based training algorithm that adaptively grows the architecture from primitive modules (e.g., convolutional layers). We demonstrate that, whilst achieving competitive performance on classification and regression datasets, ANTs benefit from (i) lightweight inference via conditional computation, (ii) hierarchical separation of features useful to the task e.g. learning meaningful class associations, such as separating natural vs. man-made objects, and (iii) a mechanism to adapt the architecture to the size and complexity of the training dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 156  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 6.

However, most standard neural networks have a fixed function type and computation budget regardless of the sample's nature or difficulty. Adaptivity is a powerful paradigm as it not only imbues practitioners with flexibility pertaining to the downstream usage of these models but can also serve as a powerful inductive bias for solving certain challenging classes of problems. In this work, we introduce a new approach called AdaTape, which allows for dynamic computation in neural networks through adaptive tape tokens. AdaTape utilizes an elastic input sequence by equipping an architecture with a dynamic read-and-write tape. Specifically, we adaptively generate input sequences using tape tokens obtained from a tape bank which can be either trainable or derived from input data. We examine the challenges and requirements to obtain dynamic sequence content and length, and propose the Adaptive Tape Reading (ATR) algorithm to achieve both goals. Through extensive experiments on image recognition tasks, we show that AdaTape can achieve better performance while maintaining the computational cost.

Hierarchical State Space Models for Continuous Sequence-to-Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Lerrel Pinto, Tess Hellebrekers, Abhinav Gupta, Carmel Majidi, Venkatesh Pattabiraman, Chenyu Wang, Raunaq Bhirangi*\n\n**Abstract:** Reasoning from sequences of raw sensory data is a ubiquitous problem across fields ranging from medical devices to robotics. These problems often involve using long sequences of raw sensor data (e.g. magnetometers, piezoresistors) to predict sequences of desirable physical quantities (e.g. force, inertial measurements). While classical approaches are powerful for locally-linear prediction problems, they often fall short when using real-world sensors. These sensors are typically non-linear, are affected by extraneous variables (e.g. vibration), and exhibit data-dependent drift. For many problems, the prediction task is exacerbated by small labeled datasets since obtaining ground-truth labels requires expensive equipment. In this work, we present Hierarchical State-Space Models (HiSS), a conceptually simple, new technique for continuous sequential prediction. HiSS stacks structured state-space models on top of each other to create a temporal hierarchy. Across six real-world sensor datasets, from tactile-based state prediction to accelerometer-based inertial measurement, HiSS outperforms state-of-the-art sequence models such as causal Transformers, LSTMs, S4, and Mamba by at least 23% on MSE. Our experiments further indicate that HiSS demonstrates efficient scaling to smaller datasets and is compatible with existing data-filtering techniques.

Hieros: Hierarchical Imagination on Structured State Space Sequence World Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state space models*\n\n*Ralf Herbrich, Rainer Schlosser, Paul Mattes*\n\n**Abstract:** One of the biggest challenges to modern deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithms is sample efficiency. Many approaches learn a world model in order to train an agent entirely in imagination, eliminating the need for direct environment interaction during training. However, these methods often suffer from either a lack of imagination accuracy, exploration capabilities, or runtime efficiency. We propose Hieros, a hierarchical policy that learns time abstracted world representations and imagines trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space. Hieros uses an S5 layer-based world model, which predicts next world states in parallel during training and iteratively during environment interaction. Due to the special properties of S5 layers, our method can train in parallel and predict next world states iteratively during imagination. This allows for more efficient training than RNN-based world models and more efficient imagination than Transformer-based world models. We show that our approach outperforms the state of the art in terms of mean and median normalized human score on the Atari 100k benchmark, and that our proposed world model is able to predict complex dynamics very accurately. We also show that Hieros displays superior exploration capabilities compared to existing approaches.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-08\n\n\n\n#### 3.

AUTOMATA: Gradient Based Data Subset Selection for Compute-Efficient Hyper-parameter Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Rishabh Iyer, Ganesh Ramakrishnan, Lucian Popa, Alexandre V. Evfimievski, Aakriti, Guttu Sai Abhishek, KrishnaTeja Killamsetty*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep neural networks have seen great success in recent years; however, training a deep model is often challenging as its performance heavily depends on the hyper-parameters used. In addition, finding the optimal hyper-parameter configuration, even with state-of-the-art (SOTA) hyper-parameter optimization (HPO) algorithms, can be time-consuming, requiring multiple training runs over the entire dataset for different possible sets of hyper-parameters. Our central insight is that using an informative subset of the dataset for model training runs involved in hyper-parameter optimization, allows us to find the optimal hyper-parameter configuration significantly faster. In this work, we propose AUTOMATA, a gradient-based subset selection framework for hyper-parameter tuning. We empirically evaluate the effectiveness of AUTOMATA in hyper-parameter tuning through several experiments on real-world datasets in the text, vision, and tabular domains. Our experiments show that using gradient-based data subsets for hyper-parameter tuning achieves significantly faster turnaround times and speedups of 3$\\times$-30$\\times$ while achieving comparable performance to the hyper-parameters found using the entire dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-15\n\n\n\n#### 5. Scalable Adaptive Computation for Iterative Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation routing*\n\n*Ting Chen, David Fleet, Allan Jabri*\n\n**Abstract:** Natural data is redundant yet predominant architectures tile computation uniformly across their input and output space. We propose the Recurrent Interface Networks (RINs), an attention-based architecture that decouples its core computation from the dimensionality of the data, enabling adaptive computation for more scalable generation of high-dimensional data. RINs focus the bulk of computation (i.e. global self-attention) on a set of latent tokens, using cross-attention to read and write (i.e. route) information between latent and data tokens. Stacking RIN blocks allows bottom-up (data to latent) and top-down (latent to data) feedback, leading to deeper and more expressive routing. While this routing introduces challenges, this is less problematic in recurrent computation settings where the task (and routing problem) changes gradually, such as iterative generation with diffusion models. We show how to leverage recurrence by conditioning the latent tokens at each forward pass of the reverse diffusion process with those from prior computation, i.e. latent self-conditioning. RINs yield state-of-the-art pixel diffusion models for image and video generation, scaling to 1024X1024 images without cascades or guidance, while being domain-agnostic and up to 10X more efficient than 2D and 3D U-Nets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-12-22\n\n\n\n#### 6. Tutel: Adaptive Mixture-of-Experts at Scale\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation routing*\n\n*Yongqiang Xiong, Mao Yang, Fan Yang, Peng Cheng, Joe Chau, Prabhat Ram, Jithin Jose, Rafael Salas, Zilong Wang, Han Hu, Ze Liu, Ziyue Yang, Yifan Xiong, Wei Cui, Changho Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** Sparsely-gated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has been widely adopted to scale deep learning models to trillion-plus parameters with fixed computational cost. The algorithmic performance of MoE relies on its token routing mechanism that forwards each input token to the right sub-models or experts. While token routing dynamically determines the amount of expert workload at runtime, existing systems suffer inefficient computation due to their static execution, namely static parallelism and pipelining, which does not adapt to the dynamic workload. We present Flex, a highly scalable stack design and implementation for MoE with dynamically adaptive parallelism and pipelining. Flex designs an identical layout for distributing MoE model parameters and input data, which can be leveraged by all possible parallelism or pipelining methods without any mathematical inequivalence or tensor migration overhead. This enables adaptive parallelism/pipelining optimization at zero cost during runtime. Based on this key design, Flex also implements various MoE acceleration techniques. Aggregating all techniques, Flex finally delivers huge speedup at any scale -- 4.96x and 5.75x speedup of a single MoE layer over 16 and 2,048 A100 GPUs, respectively, over the previous state-of-the-art. Our evaluation shows that Flex efficiently and effectively runs a real-world MoE-based model named SwinV2-MoE, built upon Swin Transformer V2, a state-of-the-art computer vision architecture. On efficiency, Flex accelerates SwinV2-MoE, achieving up to 1.55x and 2.11x speedup in training and inference over Fairseq, respectively. On effectiveness, the SwinV2-MoE model achieves superior accuracy in both pre-training and down-stream computer vision tasks such as COCO object detection than the counterpart dense model, indicating the readiness of Flex for end-to-end real-world model training and inference.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-07\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hierarchical state space models, adaptive computation routing, and efficient gradient computation, here are some key insights and techniques from the recent advances in these areas:\n\n### Hierarchical State Space Models\n\n1. **Integration with Deep Learning Architectures**:\n   - The work on SC-MAMBA2 highlights the integration of state-space models (SSMs) with deep learning frameworks, which can be particularly beneficial for handling long sequences efficiently. This model uses state-space models to overcome the computational limitations of traditional Transformer-based architectures, especially in modeling large gene sequences. This approach can be adapted for language models to handle long-range dependencies more efficiently.\n\n2. **State Space Duality and Simplifications**:\n   - The concept of State Space Duality (SSD) introduced in SC-MAMBA2 simplifies the matrix transformations in SSMs, making them more scalable and efficient. This simplification can be applied to hierarchical models to reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance.\n\n3. **Online Learning Perspective**:\n   - The Longhorn model views SSMs through an online learning perspective, treating the recurrent updates as gradient descent steps or closed-form solutions to online learning objectives. This perspective can help in designing SSM layers that are more efficient and adaptive, which is crucial for hierarchical processing in language models.\n\n### Adaptive Computation Routing\n\n1. **Dynamic Routing and State Management**:\n   - The idea of dynamic routing based on input complexity, as suggested in the analysis, can be implemented using hierarchical state space models. For example, models like Longhorn and SC-MAMBA2 demonstrate how state transitions can be managed efficiently, allowing for adaptive computation based on the input sequence's complexity.\n\n2. **Block-wise Processing**:\n   - Techniques like those used in Lightning Attention-2, which leverage block-wise processing (tiling strategies) for linear attention, can be integrated with hierarchical SSMs to handle intra-block and inter-block components efficiently. This approach can be extended to adaptive computation routing, where different blocks are processed with varying levels of granularity based on the input.\n\n### Efficient Gradient Computation\n\n1. **Online Learning Objectives**:\n   - By framing SSM updates as solutions to online learning objectives, as in the Longhorn model, the gradient computation can be streamlined. This approach can reduce the computational cost associated with gradient propagation in deep networks, making the training process more efficient.\n\n2. **Selective Updates and Hierarchical State Representation**:\n   - Employing hierarchical state representation with selective updates, as hinted in the analysis, can significantly reduce the computational overhead of gradient propagation. This method ensures that only relevant parts of the state are updated, thus optimizing the gradient computation process.\n\n### Techniques for Efficient Gradient Propagation\n\n1. **Hardware-Aware Optimization**:\n   - Techniques from ScaleCom and HPTQ, which focus on scalable compression and hardware-friendly quantization, can be applied to optimize the gradient computation process. These methods ensure efficient memory access patterns and better hardware utilization, which are crucial for large-scale language models.\n\n2. **Efficient Representation Learning**:\n   - Adaptive context pooling, as suggested by Huang et al., can help in adapting the attention granularity dynamically, which can lead to more efficient representation learning and subsequently more efficient gradient propagation.\n\n### Summary of Key Insights\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Integrate SSMs with deep learning architectures to handle long sequences efficiently, and use State Space Duality to simplify matrix transformations.\n- **Adaptive Computation**: Implement dynamic routing based on input complexity, and use block-wise processing strategies to adapt computation granularity.\n- **Efficient Gradient Computation**: Frame SSM updates as online learning objectives, use selective updates in hierarchical state representation, and apply hardware-aware optimization techniques.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and adaptive, thereby improving their overall performance.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.70)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

Score: 0.01)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Yuxin Mao, Xuyang Shen, Dong Li, Jing Zhang, Yuchao Dai, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention mechanisms have gained prominence in causal language models due to their linear computational complexity and enhanced speed. However, the inherent decay mechanism in linear attention presents challenges when applied to multi-dimensional sequence modeling tasks, such as image processing and multi-modal learning. In these scenarios, the utilization of sequential scanning to establish a global receptive field necessitates multiple scans for multi-dimensional data, thereby leading to inefficiencies. This paper identifies the inefficiency caused by a multiplicative linear recurrence and proposes an efficient alternative additive linear recurrence to avoid the issue, as it can handle multi-dimensional data within a single scan. We further develop an efficient multi-dimensional sequential modeling framework called LightNet based on the new recurrence. Moreover, we present two new multi-dimensional linear relative positional encoding methods, MD-TPE and MD-LRPE to enhance the model's ability to discern positional information in multi-dimensional scenarios. Our empirical evaluations across various tasks, including image classification, image generation, bidirectional language modeling, and autoregressive language modeling, demonstrate the efficacy of LightNet, showcasing its potential as a versatile and efficient solution for multi-dimensional sequential modeling.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/20 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), 2021.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/24 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.05892, 2024.

However, existing methods struggle with either computational complexity or model expressivity, rendering the maximum sequence length restricted. In this work, we introduce LongNet, a Transformer variant that can scale sequence length to more than 1 billion tokens, without sacrificing the performance on shorter sequences. Specifically, we propose dilated attention, which expands the attentive field exponentially as the distance grows. LongNet has significant advantages: 1) it has a linear computation complexity and a logarithm dependency between tokens; 2) it can be served as a distributed trainer for extremely long sequences; 3) its dilated attention is a drop-in replacement for standard attention, which can be seamlessly integrated with the existing Transformer-based optimization. Experiments results demonstrate that LongNet yields strong performance on both long-sequence modeling and general language tasks. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling very long sequences, e.g., treating a whole corpus or even the entire Internet as a sequence.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/20 (Score: 0.00)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2101.03961, 2021.

COMCAT: Towards Efficient Compression and Customization of Attention-Based Vision Models\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Jinqi Xiao, Miao Yin, Yu Gong, Xiao Zang, Jian Ren, Bo Yuan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods and can be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training and lower extra storage cost than the existing works.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention-based vision models, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants, have shown promising performance in various computer vision tasks. However, these emerging architectures suffer from large model sizes and high computational costs, calling for efficient model compression solutions. To date, pruning ViTs has been well studied, while other compression strategies that have been widely applied in CNN compression, e.g., model factorization, is little explored in the context of ViT compression. This paper explores an efficient method for compressing vision transformers to enrich the toolset for obtaining compact attention-based vision models. Based on the new insight on the multi-head attention layer, we develop a highly efficient ViT compression solution, which outperforms the state-of-the-art pruning methods. For compressing DeiT-small and DeiT-base models on ImageNet, our proposed approach can achieve 0.45% and 0.76% higher top-1 accuracy even with fewer parameters. Our finding can also be applied to improve the customization efficiency of text-to-image diffusion models, with much faster training (up to $2.6\\times$ speedup) and lower extra storage cost (up to $1927.5\\times$ reduction) than the existing works.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Finite-State Autoregressive Entropy Coding for Efficient Learned Lossless Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Yufeng Zhang, Hang Yu, Jianguo Li, Weiyao Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression that incorporates an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder and a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** A BSTRACT Learned lossless data compression has garnered significant attention recently due to its superior compression ratios compared to traditional compressors. However, the computational efficiency of these models jeopardizes their practicality. This paper proposes a novel system for improving the compression ratio while maintaining computational efficiency for learned lossless data compression. Our approach incorporates two essential innovations. First, we propose the Finite-State AutoRe-gressive (FSAR) entropy coder, an efficient autoregressive Markov model based entropy coder that utilizes a lookup table to expedite autoregressive entropy coding. Next, we present a Straight-Through Hardmax Quantization (STHQ) scheme to enhance the optimization of discrete latent space. Our experiments show that the proposed lossless compression method could improve the compression ratio by up to 6% compared to the baseline, with negligible extra computational time. Our work provides valuable insights into enhancing the computational efficiency of learned lossless data compression, which can have practical applications in various fields.

ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 61  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

Convergence and Alignment of Gradient Descentwith Random Back propagation Weights\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Ganlin Song, Ruitu Xu, J. Lafferty*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper studies the mathematical properties of the feedback alignment procedure by analyzing convergence and alignment for two-layer networks under squared error loss, and proves that the error converges to zero exponentially fast, and also that regularization is necessary in order for the parameters to become aligned with the random backpropagation weights.\n\n**Abstract:** Stochastic gradient descent with backpropagation is the workhorse of artificial neural networks. It has long been recognized that backpropagation fails to be a biologically plausible algorithm. Fundamentally, it is a non-local procedure -- updating one neuron's synaptic weights requires knowledge of synaptic weights or receptive fields of downstream neurons. This limits the use of artificial neural networks as a tool for understanding the biological principles of information processing in the brain. Lillicrap et al. (2016) propose a more biologically plausible\"feedback alignment\"algorithm that uses random and fixed backpropagation weights, and show promising simulations. In this paper we study the mathematical properties of the feedback alignment procedure by analyzing convergence and alignment for two-layer networks under squared error loss. In the overparameterized setting, we prove that the error converges to zero exponentially fast, and also that regularization is necessary in order for the parameters to become aligned with the random backpropagation weights. Simulations are given that are consistent with this analysis and suggest further generalizations. These results contribute to our understanding of how biologically plausible algorithms might carry out weight learning in a manner different from Hebbian learning, with performance that is comparable with the full non-local backpropagation algorithm.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Temporal Efficient Training of Spiking Neural Network via Gradient Re-weighting\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Shi-Wee Deng, Yuhang Li, Shanghang Zhang, Shi Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper analyzes why the current direct training approach with surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability, and introduces the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process can converge into flatter minima with better generalIZability.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, brain-inspired spiking neuron networks (SNNs) have attracted widespread research interest because of their event-driven and energy-efficient characteristics. Still, it is difficult to efficiently train deep SNNs due to the non-differentiability of its activation function, which disables the typically used gradient descent approaches for traditional artificial neural networks (ANNs). Although the adoption of surrogate gradient (SG) formally allows for the back-propagation of losses, the discrete spiking mechanism actually differentiates the loss landscape of SNNs from that of ANNs, failing the surrogate gradient methods to achieve comparable accuracy as for ANNs. In this paper, we first analyze why the current direct training approach with surrogate gradient results in SNNs with poor generalizability. Then we introduce the temporal efficient training (TET) approach to compensate for the loss of momentum in the gradient descent with SG so that the training process can converge into flatter minima with better generalizability. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that TET improves the temporal scalability of SNN and induces a temporal inheritable training for acceleration. Our method consistently outperforms the SOTA on all reported mainstream datasets, including CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet. Remarkably on DVS-CIFAR10, we obtained 83$\\%$ top-1 accuracy, over 10$\\%$ improvement compared to existing state of the art.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Bounce: Reliable High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization for Combinatorial and Mixed Spaces\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Leonard Papenmeier, Luigi Nardi, Matthias Poloczek*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality that reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Abstract:** Impactful applications such as materials discovery, hardware design, neural architecture search, or portfolio optimization require optimizing high-dimensional black-box functions with mixed and combinatorial input spaces. While Bayesian optimization has recently made significant progress in solving such problems, an in-depth analysis reveals that the current state-of-the-art methods are not reliable. Their performances degrade substantially when the unknown optima of the function do not have a certain structure. To fill the need for a reliable algorithm for combinatorial and mixed spaces, this paper proposes Bounce that relies on a novel map of various variable types into nested embeddings of increasing dimensionality. Comprehensive experiments show that Bounce reliably achieves and often even improves upon state-of-the-art performance on a variety of high-dimensional problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Deep Neural Machine Translation with Linear Associative Unit\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Mingxuan Wang, Zhengdong Lu, Jie Zhou, Qun Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have provably enhanced the state-of-the-art\nNeural Machine Translation (NMT) with their capability in modeling complex\nfunctions and capturing complex linguistic structures. However NMT systems with\ndeep architecture in their encoder or decoder RNNs often suffer from severe\ngradient diffusion due to the non-linear recurrent activations, which often\nmake the optimization much more difficult. To address this problem we propose\nnovel linear associative units (LAU) to reduce the gradient propagation length\ninside the recurrent unit. Different from conventional approaches (LSTM unit\nand GRU), LAUs utilizes linear associative connections between input and output\nof the recurrent unit, which allows unimpeded information flow through both\nspace and time direction. The model is quite simple, but it is surprisingly\neffective. Our empirical study on Chinese-English translation shows that our\nmodel with proper configuration can improve by 11.7 BLEU upon Groundhog and the\nbest reported results in the same setting. On WMT14 English-German task and a\nlarger WMT14 English-French task, our model achieves comparable results with\nthe state-of-the-art.\n\n**Published:** 2017-05-02T08:58:17Z  (*Updated: 2017-05-02T08:58:17Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Why and when should you pool? Analyzing Pooling in Recurrent\n  Architectures\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Pratyush Maini, Keshav Kolluru, Danish Pruthi, Mausam*\n\n**Abstract:** Pooling-based recurrent neural architectures consistently outperform their\ncounterparts without pooling. However, the reasons for their enhanced\nperformance are largely unexamined. In this work, we examine three commonly\nused pooling techniques (mean-pooling, max-pooling, and attention), and propose\nmax-attention, a novel variant that effectively captures interactions among\npredictive tokens in a sentence. We find that pooling-based architectures\nsubstantially differ from their non-pooling equivalents in their learning\nability and positional biases--which elucidate their performance benefits. By\nanalyzing the gradient propagation, we discover that pooling facilitates better\ngradient flow compared to BiLSTMs. Further, we expose how BiLSTMs are\npositionally biased towards tokens in the beginning and the end of a sequence.\nPooling alleviates such biases. Consequently, we identify settings where\npooling offers large benefits: (i) in low resource scenarios, and (ii) when\nimportant words lie towards the middle of the sentence. Among the pooling\ntechniques studied, max-attention is the most effective, resulting in\nsignificant performance gains on several text classification tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-05-01T00:47:37Z  (*Updated: 2020-10-28T02:11:02Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3.

EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Jennings, Idit Diamant, Oranit Dror, Lior Dikstein, Elad Cohen, Reuven Peretz, Hai Victor Habi*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network quantization enables the deployment of models on edge devices. An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures.

Gradient Information Matters in Policy Optimization by Back-propagating through Model\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Tie-Yan Liu, Zhi-Ming Ma, YuTing Liu, Wei Chen, Yue Wang, Chongchong Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Model-based reinforcement learning provides an efficient mechanism to find the optimal policy by interacting with the learned environment. In addition to treating the learned environment like a black-box simulator, a more effective way to use the model is to exploit its differentiability. Such methods require the gradient information of the learned environment model when calculating the policy gradient. However, since the error of gradient is not considered in the model learning phase, there is no guarantee for the model's accuracy. To address this problem, we first analyze the convergence rate for the policy optimization methods when the policy gradient is calculated using the learned environment model. The theoretical results show that the model gradient error matters in the policy optimization phrase. Then we proposed a two-model-based learning method to control the prediction error and the gradient error. We separate the different roles of these two models at the model learning phase and coordinate them at the policy optimization phase. After proposed the method, we introduce the directional derivative projection policy optimization (DDPPO) algorithm as a piratical implementation to find the optimal policy. Finally, We empirically verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and yield the state-of-the-art performance on sample efficiency through benchmark continuous control tasks.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2022-4\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-29\n\n\n\n#### 4. Improving Back-Propagation by Adding an Adversarial Gradient\n\n*From Search Query: gradient propagation*\n\n*Arild N\u00f8kland*\n\n**Abstract:** The back-propagation algorithm is widely used for learning in artificial\nneural networks. A challenge in machine learning is to create models that\ngeneralize to new data samples not seen in the training data. Recently, a\ncommon flaw in several machine learning algorithms was discovered: small\nperturbations added to the input data lead to consistent misclassification of\ndata samples. Samples that easily mislead the model are called adversarial\nexamples. Training a \"maxout\" network on adversarial examples has shown to\ndecrease this vulnerability, but also increase classification performance. This\npaper shows that adversarial training has a regularizing effect also in\nnetworks with logistic, hyperbolic tangent and rectified linear units. A simple\nextension to the back-propagation method is proposed, that adds an adversarial\ngradient to the training. The extension requires an additional forward and\nbackward pass to calculate a modified input sample, or mini batch, used as\ninput for standard back-propagation learning. The first experimental results on\nMNIST show that the \"adversarial back-propagation\" method increases the\nresistance to adversarial examples and boosts the classification performance.\nThe extension reduces the classification error on the permutation invariant\nMNIST from 1.60% to 0.95% in a logistic network, and from 1.40% to 0.78% in a\nnetwork with rectified linear units. Results on CIFAR-10 indicate that the\nmethod has a regularizing effect similar to dropout in fully connected\nnetworks. Based on these promising results, adversarial back-propagation is\nproposed as a stand-alone regularizing method that should be further\ninvestigated.\n\n**Published:** 2015-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 5. Data-Driven Offline Optimization For Architecting Hardware Accelerators\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Sergey Levine, Kevin Swersky, Milad Hashemi, Amir Yazdanbakhsh, Aviral Kumar*\n\n**Abstract:** Industry has gradually moved towards application-specific hardware accelerators in order to attain higher efficiency. While such a paradigm shift is already starting to show promising results, designers need to spend considerable manual effort and perform a large number of time-consuming simulations to find accelerators that can accelerate multiple target applications while obeying design constraints. Moreover, such a \"simulation-driven\" approach must be re-run from scratch every time the set of target applications or design constraints change. An alternative paradigm is to use a \"data-driven\", offline approach that utilizes logged simulation data, to architect hardware accelerators, without needing any form of simulations. Such an approach not only alleviates the need to run time-consuming simulation, but also enables data reuse and applies even when set of target applications changes. In this paper, we develop such a data-driven offline optimization method for designing hardware accelerators, dubbed PRIME, that enjoys all of these properties. Our approach learns a conservative, robust estimate of the desired cost function, utilizes infeasible points, and optimizes the design against this estimate without any additional simulator queries during optimization. PRIME architects accelerators -- tailored towards both single and multiple applications -- improving performance upon state-of-the-art simulation-driven methods by about 1.54x and 1.20x, while considerably reducing the required total simulation time by 93% and 99%, respectively. In addition, PRIME also architects effective accelerators for unseen applications in a zero-shot setting, outperforming simulation-based methods by 1.26x.\n\n**Conference:** data-driven-offline-optimization-for\n\n**Published:** 2021-10-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. Efficient and Modular Implicit Differentiation\n\n*From Search Query: hardware optimization*\n\n*Jean-Philippe Vert, Fabian Pedregosa, Felipe Llinares-L\u00f3pez, Stephan Hoyer, Roy Frostig, Marco Cuturi, Quentin Berthet, Mathieu Blondel*\n\n**Abstract:** Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows to express complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose automatic implicit differentiation, an efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function $F$ capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of $F$ and the implicit function theorem to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many existing implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bi-level optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.\n\n**Conference:** efficient-and-modular-implicit-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-31\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state compression, stable gradient propagation, and hardware-efficient implementation, here are some key techniques and insights derived from the provided analysis and additional sources:\n\n## Efficient State Compression\n\n### Hierarchical State Management\n- Using hierarchical state space models (HiSS) that stack structured state-space models on top of each other can effectively capture multi-scale patterns in sequences. This approach allows for efficient sequence processing by managing state representations at different levels.\n- Implementing selective state updates based on relevance can optimize memory usage. For example, methods like Hieros, which learn time-abstracted world representations and imagine trajectories at multiple time scales in latent space, can improve efficiency and representation quality.\n\n### State Compression Mechanisms\n- Techniques such as network pruning can be adapted for state compression. Methods like SNIP (Single-shot Network Pruning based on Gradients) and SynFlow, which prune weights based on their sensitivity to the loss function, can reduce the size of the model while preserving performance.\n- The use of statistical frameworks to quantify the importance of weights, as proposed in the efficient neural network pruning method based on relative importance, can help in identifying and compressing less important states.\n\n## Stable Gradient Propagation\n\n### Gradient Flow in Deep Hierarchical Networks\n- To address the vanishing gradient problem, which is particularly relevant in deep hierarchical networks, techniques like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks can be employed. LSTMs are designed to handle long-range dependencies and mitigate the vanishing gradient issue.\n- Gradient clipping, as suggested for the exploding gradient problem, can also help in stabilizing gradient flow by restricting the gradient vectors within a certain range.\n- Optimizers like Adam, which use per-coordinate scaling factors, can help in stabilizing the gradient updates. Additionally, more advanced optimizers like Shampoo, which use preconditioning, can converge quicker and provide more stable updates.\n\n### Component Design for Stability\n- Careful component design, such as in MambaLRP, which ensures specific components in the architecture are optimized for stable and reliable relevance propagation, is crucial for maintaining stable gradient flow.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementation Strategies\n\n### Hardware Optimization\n- Leveraging hardware accelerators, such as memristor-based in-memory computing for transformer networks, can significantly improve the efficiency of hierarchical models. These accelerators optimize vector-matrix multiplications, which are central to many neural network operations.\n- Implementing block-wise processing with dynamic routing, as seen in Adaptive Neural Trees and AdaTape, can be optimized for hardware efficiency. This involves designing the architecture to adaptively grow and process inputs based on complexity, which can be tailored to specific hardware capabilities.\n\n### Memory Access Patterns\n- Optimizing memory access patterns is crucial for hardware efficiency. Techniques that reduce the memory load, such as storing extra statistics efficiently in optimizers like Adam, or using pruning methods to reduce the overall model size, can improve performance.\n\nBy integrating these techniques:\n\n- **Hierarchical Processing**: Use stacked state-space models and multi-scale temporal abstraction to capture dependencies efficiently.\n- **Adaptive Computation**: Employ dynamic routing and block-wise processing to optimize resource usage and adapt to input complexity.\n- **Stable Gradient Propagation**: Utilize LSTMs, gradient clipping, and advanced optimizers to ensure stable gradient flow.\n- **Hardware Optimization**: Leverage hardware accelerators and optimize memory access patterns to enhance practical performance.\n\nThese approaches can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.73)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/49 (Score: 0.51)*\n\n```\nAdvances in neural information processing systems, 9, 1996.

In this paper, we revisit the problem of\"extreme\"LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 2. RECOMBINER: Robust and Enhanced Compression with Bayesian Implicit Neural Representations\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Jiajun He, Gergely Flamich, Zongyu Guo, Jos\u00e9 Miguel Hern\u00e1ndez-Lobato*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.\n\n**Abstract:** COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters' initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on low-resolution images at low bitrates.

Adaptive Sparse ViT: Towards Learnable Adaptive Token Pruning by Fully Exploiting Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression hierarchical transformer implementation*\n\n*Guodong Guo, Tianyi Wu, Xiangcheng Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Vision transformer has emerged as a new paradigm in computer vision, showing excellent performance while accompanied by expensive computational cost. Image token pruning is one of the main approaches for ViT compression, due to the facts that the complexity is quadratic with respect to the token number, and many tokens containing only background regions do not truly contribute to the final prediction. Existing works either rely on additional modules to score the importance of individual tokens, or implement a fixed ratio pruning strategy for different input instances. In this work, we propose an adaptive sparse token pruning framework with a minimal cost. Specifically, we firstly propose an inexpensive attention head importance weighted class attention scoring mechanism. Then, learnable parameters are inserted as thresholds to distinguish informative tokens from unimportant ones. By comparing token attention scores and thresholds, we can discard useless tokens hierarchically and thus accelerate inference. The learnable thresholds are optimized in budget-aware training to balance accuracy and complexity, performing the corresponding pruning configurations for different input instances. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. Our method improves the throughput of DeiT-S by 50% and brings only 0.2% drop in top-1 accuracy, which achieves a better trade-off between accuracy and latency than the previous methods.\n\n**Published:** 2022-09-28\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive compression techniques, training stability, hardware optimization, and memory-computation trade-offs in hierarchical transformer architectures, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques in Hierarchical Transformer Architectures\n\n- The concept of **Relaxed Recursive Transformers** introduces a layer-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique, which enables effective parameter sharing and model compression. This approach allows each layer to adapt and specialize while sharing most of the parameters across layers, making the model smaller and more efficient without compromising performance.\n\n- **PETAH (Parameter Efficient Task Adaptation for Hybrid Transformers)** discusses adapting hybrid transformer architectures, which involves adapting both the attention and convolutional layers in a parameter-efficient way. This method combines task adaptation with pruning techniques to create highly performant and storage-friendly models, which is relevant for hierarchical models needing adaptive compression.\n\n## Training Stability Methods for Deep Hierarchical Networks\n\n- The **Relaxed Recursive Transformers** paper also touches on the stability of training deep hierarchical networks by employing a hierarchical framework with low-dimensional projectors and globally-shared high-dimensional projectors. This setup enhances the model's representational capabilities and stability by facilitating the capture of intricate information and dependencies across different layers.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Strategies for Transformers\n\n- The **Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention** paper introduces a hardware accelerator leveraging memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach significantly accelerates transformer self-attention operations compared to digital counterparts, highlighting the importance of hardware-specific optimizations for efficient transformer implementation.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-Offs in Hierarchical Models\n\n- **PETAH** emphasizes the importance of balancing parameter efficiency and computational efficiency. By adapting both attention and convolutional layers, PETAH models achieve better performance with fewer parameters and reduced computational overhead during inference, demonstrating effective memory-computation trade-offs.\n\n- **Relaxed Recursive Transformers** also address memory efficiency by sharing parameters across layers and only learning a few extra parameters per layer. This approach reduces the overall model size and memory footprint while maintaining good performance, which is crucial for hierarchical models.\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Benchmarks\n\n- **Relaxed Recursive Transformers** provide implementation details on how layer-wise LoRA is integrated into the transformer architecture. The paper includes thorough evaluations on various benchmarks, showing the effectiveness of this approach compared to prior efficient transformer models.\n\n- **PETAH** includes experiments comparing the performance of PETAH-adapted hybrid models against standard vision transformers and other adaptation methods. The results show that PETAH models outperform other methods in terms of parameter efficiency and computational efficiency.\n\n## Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n- The integration of **IBT (Information-Based Transformers) with Partial Differential Equations (PDEs)** in the context of understanding token embeddings as continuous fields can provide insights into information flow and compression trends within transformers. This can help in designing more memory-efficient models by optimizing the information retention and compression across layers.\n\nIn summary, the papers on **Relaxed Recursive Transformers** and **PETAH** provide valuable insights into adaptive compression, training stability, and memory-computation trade-offs, while the **Efficient memristor accelerator** highlights hardware-specific optimization strategies. These findings can significantly aid in improving the design of autoregressive language models.\n",

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers.

The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

Hiera: A Hierarchical Vision Transformer without the Bells-and-Whistles\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Chaitanya K. Ryali, Yuan-Ting Hu, Daniel Bolya, Chen Wei, Haoqi Fan, Po-Yao (Bernie) Huang, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Arkabandhu Chowdhury, Omid Poursaeed, Judy Hoffman, J. Malik, Yanghao Li, Christoph Feichtenhofer*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hiera is an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training.\n\n**Abstract:** Modern hierarchical vision transformers have added several vision-specific components in the pursuit of supervised classification performance. While these components lead to effective accuracies and attractive FLOP counts, the added complexity actually makes these transformers slower than their vanilla ViT counterparts. In this paper, we argue that this additional bulk is unnecessary. By pretraining with a strong visual pretext task (MAE), we can strip out all the bells-and-whistles from a state-of-the-art multi-stage vision transformer without losing accuracy. In the process, we create Hiera, an extremely simple hierarchical vision transformer that is more accurate than previous models while being significantly faster both at inference and during training. We evaluate Hiera on a variety of tasks for image and video recognition.

Landman*\n\n**TL;DR:** 3D UX-Net is proposed, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation and competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR), and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice.\n\n**Abstract:** The recent 3D medical ViTs (e.g., SwinUNETR) achieve the state-of-the-art performances on several 3D volumetric data benchmarks, including 3D medical image segmentation. Hierarchical transformers (e.g., Swin Transformers) reintroduced several ConvNet priors and further enhanced the practical viability of adapting volumetric segmentation in 3D medical datasets. The effectiveness of hybrid approaches is largely credited to the large receptive field for non-local self-attention and the large number of model parameters. In this work, we propose a lightweight volumetric ConvNet, termed 3D UX-Net, which adapts the hierarchical transformer using ConvNet modules for robust volumetric segmentation. Specifically, we revisit volumetric depth-wise convolutions with large kernel size (e.g. starting from $7\\times7\\times7$) to enable the larger global receptive fields, inspired by Swin Transformer. We further substitute the multi-layer perceptron (MLP) in Swin Transformer blocks with pointwise depth convolutions and enhance model performances with fewer normalization and activation layers, thus reducing the number of model parameters. 3D UX-Net competes favorably with current SOTA transformers (e.g. SwinUNETR) using three challenging public datasets on volumetric brain and abdominal imaging: 1) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FLARE, 2) MICCAI Challenge 2021 FeTA, and 3) MICCAI Challenge 2022 AMOS. 3D UX-Net consistently outperforms SwinUNETR with improvement from 0.929 to 0.938 Dice (FLARE2021) and 0.867 to 0.874 Dice (Feta2021). We further evaluate the transfer learning capability of 3D UX-Net with AMOS2022 and demonstrates another improvement of $2.27\\%$ Dice (from 0.880 to 0.900).

HiNeRV: Video Compression with Hierarchical Encoding based Neural Representation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Ho Man Kwan, Ge Gao, Fan Zhang, Andrew Gower, David R. Bull*\n\n**TL;DR:** HiNeRV is an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings and employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Learning-based video compression is currently a popular research topic, offering the potential to compete with conventional standard video codecs. In this context, Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have previously been used to represent and compress image and video content, demonstrating relatively high decoding speed compared to other methods. However, existing INR-based methods have failed to deliver rate quality performance comparable with the state of the art in video compression. This is mainly due to the simplicity of the employed network architectures, which limit their representation capability. In this paper, we propose HiNeRV, an INR that combines light weight layers with novel hierarchical positional encodings. We employs depth-wise convolutional, MLP and interpolation layers to build the deep and wide network architecture with high capacity. HiNeRV is also a unified representation encoding videos in both frames and patches at the same time, which offers higher performance and flexibility than existing methods. We further build a video codec based on HiNeRV and a refined pipeline for training, pruning and quantization that can better preserve HiNeRV's performance during lossy model compression. The proposed method has been evaluated on both UVG and MCL-JCV datasets for video compression, demonstrating significant improvement over all existing INRs baselines and competitive performance when compared to learning-based codecs (72.3% overall bit rate saving over HNeRV and 43.4% over DCVC on the UVG dataset, measured in PSNR).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 23  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. Entroformer: A Transformer-based Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Yichen Qian, Ming Lin, Xiuyu Sun, Zhiyu Tan, Rong Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** One critical component in lossy deep image compression is the entropy model, which predicts the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation in the encoding and decoding modules. Previous works build entropy models upon convolutional neural networks which are inefficient in capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently. Different from vision transformers in image classification, the Entroformer is highly optimized for image compression, including a top-k self-attention and a diamond relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we further expand this architecture with a parallel bidirectional context model to speed up the decoding process. The experiments show that the Entroformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 108  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n#### 5. Hierarchical Vector Quantized Transformer for Multi-class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Ruiying Lu, Yujie Wu, Long Tian, Dongsheng Wang, Bo Chen, Xiyang Liu, Ruimin Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework, and investigates an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Unsupervised image Anomaly Detection (UAD) aims to learn robust and discriminative representations of normal samples. While separate solutions per class endow expensive computation and limited generalizability, this paper focuses on building a unified framework for multiple classes. Under such a challenging setting, popular reconstruction-based networks with continuous latent representation assumption always suffer from the\"identical shortcut\"issue, where both normal and abnormal samples can be well recovered and difficult to distinguish. To address this pivotal issue, we propose a hierarchical vector quantized prototype-oriented Transformer under a probabilistic framework. First, instead of learning the continuous representations, we preserve the typical normal patterns as discrete iconic prototypes, and confirm the importance of Vector Quantization in preventing the model from falling into the shortcut. The vector quantized iconic prototype is integrated into the Transformer for reconstruction, such that the abnormal data point is flipped to a normal data point.Second, we investigate an exquisite hierarchical framework to relieve the codebook collapse issue and replenish frail normal patterns. Third, a prototype-oriented optimal transport method is proposed to better regulate the prototypes and hierarchically evaluate the abnormal score. By evaluating on MVTec-AD and VisA datasets, our model surpasses the state-of-the-art alternatives and possesses good interpretability.

ConvLLaVA: Hierarchical Backbones as Visual Encoder for Large Multimodal Models\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Bo Zheng, Gao Huang, Shiji Song, Jun Song, Yuan Gao, Jiale Yuan, ZiMing Wang, Sijie Cheng, Chunjiang Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** High-resolution Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) encounter the challenges of excessive visual tokens and quadratic visual complexity. Current high-resolution LMMs address the quadratic complexity while still generating excessive visual tokens. However, the redundancy in visual tokens is the key problem as it leads to more substantial compute. To mitigate this issue, we propose ConvLLaVA, which employs ConvNeXt, a hierarchical backbone, as the visual encoder of LMM to replace Vision Transformer (ViT). ConvLLaVA compresses high-resolution images into information-rich visual features, effectively preventing the generation of excessive visual tokens. To enhance the capabilities of ConvLLaVA, we propose two critical optimizations. Since the low-resolution pretrained ConvNeXt underperforms when directly applied on high resolution, we update it to bridge the gap. Moreover, since ConvNeXt's original compression ratio is inadequate for much higher resolution inputs, we train a successive stage to further compress the visual tokens, thereby reducing redundancy. These optimizations enable ConvLLaVA to support inputs of 1536x1536 resolution generating only 576 visual tokens, capable of handling images of arbitrary aspect ratios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art models on mainstream benchmarks.

Weisfeiler and Lehman Go Cellular: CW Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Michael Bronstein, Guido Mont\u00fafar, Pietro Li\u00f2, Yu Guang Wang, Nina Otter, Fabrizio Frasca, Cristian Bodnar*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are limited in their expressive power, struggle with long-range interactions and lack a principled way to model higher-order structures. These problems can be attributed to the strong coupling between the computational graph and the input graph structure. The recently proposed Message Passing Simplicial Networks naturally decouple these elements by performing message passing on the clique complex of the graph. Nevertheless, these models can be severely constrained by the rigid combinatorial structure of Simplicial Complexes (SCs). In this work, we extend recent theoretical results on SCs to regular Cell Complexes, topological objects that flexibly subsume SCs and graphs. We show that this generalisation provides a powerful set of graph \"lifting\" transformations, each leading to a unique hierarchical message passing procedure. The resulting methods, which we collectively call CW Networks (CWNs), are strictly more powerful than the WL test and not less powerful than the 3-WL test. In particular, we demonstrate the effectiveness of one such scheme, based on rings, when applied to molecular graph problems. The proposed architecture benefits from provably larger expressivity than commonly used GNNs, principled modelling of higher-order signals and from compressing the distances between nodes. We demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art results on a variety of molecular datasets.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-23\n\n\n\n#### 3. Hierarchical Autoregressive Modeling for Neural Video Compression\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical transformer state compression*\n\n*Stephan Mandt, Joseph Marino, Yibo Yang, Ruihan Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work by Marino et al. (2020) showed improved performance in sequential density estimation by combining masked autoregressive flows with hierarchical latent variable models. We draw a connection between such autoregressive generative models and the task of lossy video compression. Specifically, we view recent neural video compression methods (Lu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020b; Agustssonet al., 2020) as instances of a generalized stochastic temporal autoregressive transform, and propose avenues for enhancement based on this insight. Comprehensive evaluations on large-scale video data show improved rate-distortion performance over both state-of-the-art neural and conventional video compression methods.\n\n**Conference:** hierarchical-autoregressive-modeling-for\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-19\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical state management, adaptive compression, gradient optimization, and hardware efficiency, here are some key points and references that can guide the research:\n\n## Hierarchical State Management in Transformers\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing in transformers is explored in the context of managing multi-scale temporal information. For instance, the \"Relaxed Recursive Transformers\" paper discusses a novel transformer architecture that enables effective parameter sharing across layers, which can be seen as a form of hierarchical state management. This approach allows the model to learn recursive patterns and reduce the number of parameters, making it more efficient.\n\n## Adaptive Compression Techniques\n\n- Adaptive compression techniques are crucial for reducing the memory and computational footprint of transformer models. The \"Compression via Pre-trained Transformers\" paper investigates the use of pre-trained transformers for adaptive compression. It shows that small pre-trained transformers can achieve competitive compression ratios across different modalities, and the adaptive online compressors are quasi-parameterless, which can be beneficial for dynamic compression rate determination.\n\n- The \"Relaxed Recursive Transformers\" also touches on model compression by sharing most of the parameters across layers and using a layer-wise low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique. This method improves the model's efficiency while maintaining performance.\n\n## Gradient Optimization Strategies\n\n- Gradient flow optimization is essential for the stability and efficiency of deep architectures. The \"Understanding Transformer Model Parameters\" article discusses the importance of layer normalization in maximizing performance as the model size increases. It also hints at the careful management of gradient paths, which is critical for training large models efficiently.\n\n- The \"Understanding Nonlinear Transformers\" article provides insights into the gradient flow dynamics using Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) to analyze the information flow within transformers. This approach can help in understanding and optimizing the gradient paths for more stable and efficient training.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n- Hardware-efficient implementations are vital for scaling transformer models. The \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" paper introduces a hardware accelerator leveraging memristor-based in-memory computing, which achieves a 10\u00d7 acceleration of transformer self-attention compared to digital counterparts. This approach highlights the potential for significant performance gains through specialized hardware.\n\n## Memory-Computation Tradeoffs\n\n- The tradeoffs between memory and computation are critical in transformer architectures. The \"Relaxed Recursive Transformers\" paper discusses how parameter sharing and layer-wise LoRA can reduce the memory footprint while maintaining performance. This approach balances the need for computational efficiency with the constraints of memory.\n\n- The \"Understanding Transformer Model Parameters\" article also addresses the impact of embedding dimensions and the number of layers on computational costs and memory requirements. It notes that while increasing certain parameters can enhance performance, there are thresholds beyond which additional dimensions or layers do not yield significant benefits.\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Metrics\n\n- For implementation details, the \"Relaxed Recursive Transformers\" paper provides a thorough evaluation of their method on various benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness compared to prior efficient transformer models. This includes insights into the layer-wise adaptation and parameter sharing mechanisms.\n\n- The \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" paper details the training and inference procedures using memristor-based hardware, including the mapping algorithm and the hybrid circuit model. This provides a clear understanding of the hardware-efficient implementation and its performance metrics.\n\nBy integrating these concepts, researchers can develop a hierarchical autoregressive language model that is efficient, scalable, and optimized for both memory and computation. Here are some key takeaways:\n\n- **Hierarchical State Management**: Use recursive patterns and layer-wise parameter sharing to manage multi-scale temporal information efficiently.\n- **Adaptive Compression**: Employ pre-trained transformers and adaptive online compressors to dynamically adjust compression rates and reduce the memory footprint.\n- **Gradient Optimization**: Utilize PDE-inspired formulations to analyze and optimize gradient paths, ensuring stable and efficient training.\n- **Hardware Efficiency**: Leverage memristor-based in-memory computing or other specialized hardware to accelerate transformer operations.\n- **Memory-Computation Tradeoffs**: Balance parameter sharing, layer numbers, and embedding dimensions to optimize performance while managing memory and computational costs.\n\nThese strategies can help in designing an autoregressive language model that is not only highly performant but also efficient and scalable.\n",

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods.

Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.40)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Hierarchical Transformers Are More Efficient Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.32)\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Szymon Tworkowski, Micha\u0142 Tyrolski, Lukasz Kaiser, Yuhuai Wu, Christian Szegedy, H. Michalewski*\n\n**Published in:** NAACL-HLT (2021)\t**Cited by** 40  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Hourglass is created - a hierarchical Transformer language model that improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark and sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer models yield impressive results on many NLP and sequence modeling tasks. Remarkably, Transformers can handle long sequences which allows them to produce long coherent outputs: full paragraphs produced by GPT-3 or well-structured images produced by DALL-E. These large language models are impressive but also very inefficient and costly, which limits their applications and accessibility. We postulate that having an explicit hierarchical architecture is the key to Transformers that efficiently handle long sequences. To verify this claim, we first study different ways to downsample and upsample activations in Transformers so as to make them hierarchical. We use the best performing upsampling and downsampling layers to create Hourglass - a hierarchical Transformer language model. Hourglass improves upon the Transformer baseline given the same amount of computation and can yield the same results as Transformers more efficiently. In particular, Hourglass sets new state-of-the-art for Transformer models on the ImageNet32 generation task and improves language modeling efficiency on the widely studied enwik8 benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 15/25 (Score: 0.32)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

Though several specific transformer architectures have been designed to tackle issues of long-range dependencies, existing methods like Transformer-XL are plagued by a high percentage of ineffective memories. In this study, we present a plug-and-play strategy, known as TRAining-free Memory Selection (TRAMS), that selects tokens participating in attention calculation based on one simple metric. This strategy allows us to keep tokens that are likely to have a high attention score with the current queries and ignore the other ones. We have tested our approach on the word-level benchmark (WikiText-103) and the character-level benchmark (enwik8), and the results indicate an improvement without having additional training or adding additional parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/16 (Score: 0.29)*\n\n```\nMatt Mahoney. 2011.

Agustsson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression by independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past.\n\n**Abstract:** We show how transformers can be used to vastly simplify neural video compression. Previous methods have been relying on an increasing number of architectural biases and priors, including motion prediction and warping operations, resulting in complex models. Instead, we independently map input frames to representations and use a transformer to model their dependencies, letting it predict the distribution of future representations given the past. The resulting video compression transformer outperforms previous methods on standard video compression data sets. Experiments on synthetic data show that our model learns to handle complex motion patterns such as panning, blurring and fading purely from data. Our approach is easy to implement, and we release code to facilitate future research.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 77  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 2. Frequency-Aware Transformer for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Han Li, Shaohui Li, Wenrui Dai, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, H. Xiong*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block is proposed that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC and a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** Learned image compression (LIC) has gained traction as an effective solution for image storage and transmission in recent years. However, existing LIC methods are redundant in latent representation due to limitations in capturing anisotropic frequency components and preserving directional details. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel frequency-aware transformer (FAT) block that for the first time achieves multiscale directional ananlysis for LIC. The FAT block comprises frequency-decomposition window attention (FDWA) modules to capture multiscale and directional frequency components of natural images. Additionally, we introduce frequency-modulation feed-forward network (FMFFN) to adaptively modulate different frequency components, improving rate-distortion performance. Furthermore, we present a transformer-based channel-wise autoregressive (T-CA) model that effectively exploits channel dependencies. Experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance compared to existing LIC methods, and evidently outperforms latest standardized codec VTM-12.1 by 14.5%, 15.1%, 13.0% in BD-rate on the Kodak, Tecnick, and CLIC datasets.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. GOAT: A Global Transformer on Large-scale Graphs\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Kezhi Kong, Jiuhai Chen, John Kirchenbauer, Renkun Ni, C. B. Bruss, T. Goldstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** GOAT, a scalable global graph transformer where each node conceptually attends to all the nodes in the graph and homophily/heterophily relationships can be learnt adaptively from the data, is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph transformers have been competitive on graph classification tasks, but they fail to outperform Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on node classification, which is a common task performed on large-scale graphs for industrial applications. Meanwhile, existing GNN architectures are limited in their ability to perform equally well on both homophilious and heterophilious graphs as their inductive biases are generally tailored to only one setting. To address these issues, we propose GOAT, a scalable global graph transformer. In GOAT, each node conceptually attends to all the nodes in the graph and homophily/heterophily relationships can be learnt adaptively from the data. We provide theoretical justification for our approximate global self-attention scheme, and show it to be scalable to large-scale graphs. We demonstrate the competitiveness of GOAT on both heterophil-ious and homophilious graphs with millions of nodes.

Communication-Efficient Adaptive Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Yujia Wang, Lu Lin, Jinghui Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a novel communication-efficient adaptive federated learning method (FedCAMS) with theoretical convergence guarantees and shows that in the nonconvex stochastic optimization setting, the proposed FedCAMS achieves the same convergence rate of O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TKm}})$ as its non-compressed counterparts.\n\n**Abstract:** Federated learning is a machine learning training paradigm that enables clients to jointly train models without sharing their own localized data. However, the implementation of federated learning in practice still faces numerous challenges, such as the large communication overhead due to the repetitive server-client synchronization and the lack of adaptivity by SGD-based model updates. Despite that various methods have been proposed for reducing the communication cost by gradient compression or quantization, and the federated versions of adaptive optimizers such as FedAdam are proposed to add more adaptivity, the current federated learning framework still cannot solve the aforementioned challenges all at once. In this paper, we propose a novel communication-efficient adaptive federated learning method (FedCAMS) with theoretical convergence guarantees. We show that in the nonconvex stochastic optimization setting, our proposed FedCAMS achieves the same convergence rate of $O(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{TKm}})$ as its non-compressed counterparts.

Recovering Realistic Texture in Image Super-resolution by Deep Spatial Feature Transform\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Xintao Wang, Chen Change Loy, Chao Dong, Ke Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** Despite that convolutional neural networks (CNN) have recently demonstrated\nhigh-quality reconstruction for single-image super-resolution (SR), recovering\nnatural and realistic texture remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we\nshow that it is possible to recover textures faithful to semantic classes. In\nparticular, we only need to modulate features of a few intermediate layers in a\nsingle network conditioned on semantic segmentation probability maps. This is\nmade possible through a novel Spatial Feature Transform (SFT) layer that\ngenerates affine transformation parameters for spatial-wise feature modulation.\nSFT layers can be trained end-to-end together with the SR network using the\nsame loss function. During testing, it accepts an input image of arbitrary size\nand generates a high-resolution image with just a single forward pass\nconditioned on the categorical priors. Our final results show that an SR\nnetwork equipped with SFT can generate more realistic and visually pleasing\ntextures in comparison to state-of-the-art SRGAN and EnhanceNet.\n\n**Conference:** recovering-realistic-texture-in-image-super-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-04-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Variable-Rate Deep Image Compression through Spatially-Adaptive Feature Transform\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Bohyung Han, Jinyoung Choi, Myungseo Song*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a versatile deep image compression network based on Spatial Feature Transform (SFT arXiv:1804.02815), which takes a source image and a corresponding quality map as inputs and produce a compressed image with variable rates. Our model covers a wide range of compression rates using a single model, which is controlled by arbitrary pixel-wise quality maps. In addition, the proposed framework allows us to perform task-aware image compressions for various tasks, e.g., classification, by efficiently estimating optimized quality maps specific to target tasks for our encoding network. This is even possible with a pretrained network without learning separate models for individual tasks. Our algorithm achieves outstanding rate-distortion trade-off compared to the approaches based on multiple models that are optimized separately for several different target rates. At the same level of compression, the proposed approach successfully improves performance on image classification and text region quality preservation via task-aware quality map estimation without additional model training.

Extreme Compression of Large Language Models via Additive Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive compression transformer implementation*\n\n*Dan Alistarh, Artem Babenko, Elias Frantar, Denis Kuznedelev, Andrei Panferov, Vage Egiazarian*\n\n**Abstract:** The emergence of accurate open large language models (LLMs) has led to a race towards performant quantization techniques which can enable their execution on end-user devices. In this paper, we revisit the problem of \"extreme\" LLM compression-defined as targeting extremely low bit counts, such as 2 to 3 bits per parameter-from the point of view of classic methods in Multi-Codebook Quantization (MCQ). Our algorithm, called AQLM, generalizes the classic Additive Quantization (AQ) approach for information retrieval to advance the state-of-the-art in LLM compression, via two innovations: 1) learned additive quantization of weight matrices in input-adaptive fashion, and 2) joint optimization of codebook parameters across each transformer blocks. Broadly, AQLM is the first scheme that is Pareto optimal in terms of accuracy-vs-model-size when compressing to less than 3 bits per parameter, and significantly improves upon all known schemes in the extreme compression (2bit) regime. In addition, AQLM is practical: we provide fast GPU and CPU implementations of AQLM for token generation, which enable us to match or outperform optimized FP16 implementations for speed, while executing in a much smaller memory footprint.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on adaptive compression, memory-efficient variants, hardware optimization, gradient optimization, and state compression, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Implementation Details of Adaptive Compression in Transformer Architectures\n\n- The paper on \"KV cache compression\" discusses an adaptive compression method using low-rank projection matrices to reduce the dimensionality of cache features. This approach involves tuning orthogonal projection matrices with a distillation objective and adaptively searching for optimal compression rates for various layers and heads. This method maintains high performance even with significant compression, sustaining over 90% of the original model's performance.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Variants\n\n- The concept of spatiotemporal adaptive compression, as seen in the LongVU paper, can be applied to reduce the number of tokens in long sequences, which is relevant for memory-efficient processing. This method leverages cross-modal query and inter-frame dependencies to adaptively reduce temporal and spatial redundancy, effectively processing long videos with minimal visual information loss.\n\n## Hardware-Optimized Transformer Implementations\n\n- The paper on \"Efficient memristor accelerator for transformer self-attention\" introduces a hardware accelerator using memristor-based in-memory computing. This approach accelerates transformer self-attention by 10 times compared to digital counterparts and maintains high accuracy even under device variability. The implementation details include mapping weight matrices to memristor conductance matrices and executing inference on a hybrid circuit model.\n\n## Gradient Optimization Techniques for Deep Hierarchical Networks\n\n- Model parallelism and adaptive optimization algorithms are crucial for training large transformer models efficiently. Techniques like AdamW, which adjust the learning rate based on parameter updates, can lead to faster convergence and improved training efficiency. Additionally, mixed-precision training and model parallelism across multiple GPUs can significantly enhance training speed and reduce memory usage.\n\n## State Compression Methods in Language Models\n\n- The KV cache compression paper also discusses state compression methods, focusing on the feature dimension axis of the cache tensors. By using PCA projection and a Matryoshka training strategy, the method achieves a smooth tradeoff between performance and compression rate, allowing for the compression of pre-trained LLMs while maintaining high performance.\n\n### Specific Compression Techniques and Effectiveness\n\n- Adaptive compression using low-rank projection matrices and PCA projection shows high effectiveness in maintaining model performance while reducing memory usage. These methods are particularly useful for reducing the KV cache size, which is a significant bottleneck in transformer models.\n\n### Hardware Optimization Strategies\n\n- Memristor-based in-memory computing and IO-aware designs like FlashAttention are critical for hardware optimization. These approaches reduce memory reads/writes and accelerate computations, making them essential for efficient transformer implementations.\n\n### Training Stability Methods\n\n- Adaptive optimization algorithms and mixed-precision training help in stabilizing the training process. These methods reduce the risk of overfitting and accelerate convergence, ensuring stable and efficient training of deep hierarchical networks.\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\n\n- The memristor-based accelerator achieves a 10 times acceleration in transformer self-attention and maintains an average accuracy of 95.47% over multiple runs. The LongVU method consistently surpasses existing methods in video understanding benchmarks, especially for hour-long video tasks.\n\n### Implementation Challenges and Solutions\n\n- Challenges include balancing memory and computational costs, as well as ensuring that compression methods do not significantly degrade performance. Solutions involve careful design of information flow, IO-aware architectures, and adaptive compression techniques that maintain performance while reducing memory usage.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models that leverage adaptive compression, hardware optimization, and advanced training techniques.\n",

PanGu-\u03c0: Enhancing Language Model Architectures via Nonlinearity Compensation (Avg.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 25/62 (Score: 0.71)*\n\n```\n[47] N. Du et al.

Smith*\n\n**Published in:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2021)\t**Cited by** 21  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and it outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer architectures have achieved state- of-the-art results on a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one. Our experiments on language modeling, machine translation, and masked language model finetuning show that our approach outperforms previous efficient attention models; compared to the strong transformer baselines, it significantly improves the inference time and space efficiency with no or negligible accuracy loss.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/39 (Score: 0.64)*\n\n```\nIn Proc. of EMNLP.

Weston*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 10  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, and to provide improved modeling power compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanisms have become a standard tool for sequence modeling tasks, in particular by stacking self-attention layers over the entire input sequence as in the Transformer architecture. In this work we introduce a novel attention procedure called staircase attention that, unlike self-attention, operates across the sequence (in time) recurrently processing the input by adding another step of processing. A step in the staircase comprises of backward tokens (encoding the sequence so far seen) and forward tokens (ingesting a new part of the sequence), or an extreme Ladder version with a forward step of zero that simply repeats the Transformer on each step of the ladder, sharing the weights. We thus describe a family of such models that can trade off performance and compute, by either increasing the amount of recurrence through time, the amount of sequential processing via recurrence in depth, or both. Staircase attention is shown to be able to solve tasks that involve tracking that conventional Transformers cannot, due to this recurrence. Further, it is shown to provide improved modeling power for the same size model (number of parameters) compared to self-attentive Transformers on large language modeling and dialogue tasks, yielding significant perplexity gains.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/21 (Score: 0.62)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1804.09849, 2018.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.59)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

History Aware Multimodal Transformer for Vision-and-Language Navigation\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state management transformer memory*\n\n*Shizhe Chen, Pierre-Louis Guhur, C. Schmid, I. Laptev*\n\n**TL;DR:** A History Aware Multimodal Transformer (HAMT) is introduced to incorporate a long-horizon history into multimodal decision making for vision-and-language navigation and achieves new state of the art on a broad range of VLN tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision-and-language navigation (VLN) aims to build autonomous visual agents that follow instructions and navigate in real scenes. To remember previously visited locations and actions taken, most approaches to VLN implement memory using recurrent states. Instead, we introduce a History Aware Multimodal Transformer (HAMT) to incorporate a long-horizon history into multimodal decision making. HAMT efficiently encodes all the past panoramic observations via a hierarchical vision transformer (ViT), which first encodes individual images with ViT, then models spatial relation between images in a panoramic observation and finally takes into account temporal relation between panoramas in the history. It, then, jointly combines text, history and current observation to predict the next action. We first train HAMT end-to-end using several proxy tasks including single step action prediction and spatial relation prediction, and then use reinforcement learning to further improve the navigation policy. HAMT achieves new state of the art on a broad range of VLN tasks, including VLN with fine-grained instructions (R2R, RxR), high-level instructions (R2R-Last, REVERIE), dialogs (CVDN) as well as long-horizon VLN (R4R, R2R-Back). We demonstrate HAMT to be particularly effective for navigation tasks with longer trajectories.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 179  (*Influential: 46*)\n\n#### 2. Shifted Chunk Transformer for Spatio-Temporal Representational Learning\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state management transformer memory*\n\n*Xuefan Zha, Wentao Zhu, Tingxun Lv, Sen Yang, Ji Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** A shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks that can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip and outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches onKinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Abstract:** Spatio-temporal representational learning has been widely adopted in various fields such as action recognition, video object segmentation, and action anticipation. Previous spatio-temporal representational learning approaches primarily employ ConvNets or sequential models,e.g., LSTM, to learn the intra-frame and inter-frame features. Recently, Transformer models have successfully dominated the study of natural language processing (NLP), image classification, etc. However, the pure-Transformer based spatio-temporal learning can be prohibitively costly on memory and computation to extract fine-grained features from a tiny patch. To tackle the training difficulty and enhance the spatio-temporal learning, we construct a shifted chunk Transformer with pure self-attention blocks. Leveraging the recent efficient Transformer design in NLP, this shifted chunk Transformer can learn hierarchical spatio-temporal features from a local tiny patch to a global video clip. Our shifted self-attention can also effectively model complicated inter-frame variances. Furthermore, we build a clip encoder based on Transformer to model long-term temporal dependencies. We conduct thorough ablation studies to validate each component and hyper-parameters in our shifted chunk Transformer, and it outperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches on Kinetics-400, Kinetics-600, UCF101, and HMDB51.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 27  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning with Hierarchical Coordination for Emergency Responder Stationing\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state management transformer memory*\n\n*Amutheezan Sivagnanam, Ava Pettet, Hunter Lee, Ayan Mukhopadhyay, Abhishek Dubey, Aron Laszka*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work addresses the issue of long decision times by introducing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach, based on the same hierarchical decomposition, but replacing online search with learning, which reduces computation time per decision by three orders of magnitude.\n\n**Abstract:** An emergency responder management (ERM) system dispatches responders, such as ambulances, when it receives requests for medical aid. ERM systems can also proactively reposition responders between predesignated waiting locations to cover any gaps that arise due to the prior dispatch of responders or significant changes in the distribution of anticipated requests. Optimal repositioning is computationally challenging due to the exponential number of ways to allocate responders between locations and the uncertainty in future requests. The state-of-the-art approach in proactive repositioning is a hierarchical approach based on spatial decomposition and online Monte Carlo tree search, which may require minutes of computation for each decision in a domain where seconds can save lives. We address the issue of long decision times by introducing a novel reinforcement learning (RL) approach, based on the same hierarchical decomposition, but replacing online search with learning. To address the computational challenges posed by large, variable-dimensional, and discrete state and action spaces, we propose: (1) actor-critic based agents that incorporate transformers to handle variable-dimensional states and actions, (2) projections to fixed-dimensional observations to handle complex states, and (3) combinatorial techniques to map continuous actions to discrete allocations. We evaluate our approach using real-world data from two U.S. cities, Nashville, TN and Seattle, WA. Our experiments show that compared to the state of the art, our approach reduces computation time per decision by three orders of magnitude, while also slightly reducing average ambulance response time by 5 seconds.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. IA-RED2: Interpretability-Aware Redundancy Reduction for Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state management transformer memory*\n\n*Bowen Pan, Yifan Jiang, Rameswar Panda, Zhangyang Wang, R. Feris, A. Oliva*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the interpretability that naturally emerged in the I-RED framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention-based model, transformer, is recently becoming the leading backbone in the field of computer vision. In spite of the impressive success made by transformers in a variety of vision tasks, it still suffers from heavy computation and intensive memory costs. To address this limitation, this paper presents an Interpretability-Aware REDundancy REDuction framework (IA-RED$^2$). We start by observing a large amount of redundant computation, mainly spent on uncorrelated input patches, and then introduce an interpretable module to dynamically and gracefully drop these redundant patches. This novel framework is then extended to a hierarchical structure, where uncorrelated tokens at different stages are gradually removed, resulting in a considerable shrinkage of computational cost. We include extensive experiments on both image and video tasks, where our method could deliver up to 1.4x speed-up for state-of-the-art models like DeiT and TimeSformer, by only sacrificing less than 0.7% accuracy. More importantly, contrary to other acceleration approaches, our method is inherently interpretable with substantial visual evidence, making vision transformer closer to a more human-understandable architecture while being lighter. We demonstrate that the interpretability that naturally emerged in our framework can outperform the raw attention learned by the original visual transformer, as well as those generated by off-the-shelf interpretation methods, with both qualitative and quantitative results.

Transformers Learn Shortcuts to Automata\n\n*From Search Query: hierarchical state management transformer memory*\n\n*Bingbin Liu, J. Ash, Surbhi Goel, A. Krishnamurthy, Cyril Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that a low-depth Transformer can represent the computations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory algorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics.\n\n**Abstract:** Algorithmic reasoning requires capabilities which are most naturally understood through recurrent models of computation, like the Turing machine. However, Transformer models, while lacking recurrence, are able to perform such reasoning using far fewer layers than the number of reasoning steps. This raises the question: what solutions are learned by these shallow and non-recurrent models? We find that a low-depth Transformer can represent the computations of any finite-state automaton (thus, any bounded-memory algorithm), by hierarchically reparameterizing its recurrent dynamics. Our theoretical results characterize shortcut solutions, whereby a Transformer with $o(T)$ layers can exactly replicate the computation of an automaton on an input sequence of length $T$. We find that polynomial-sized $O(\\log T)$-depth solutions always exist; furthermore, $O(1)$-depth simulators are surprisingly common, and can be understood using tools from Krohn-Rhodes theory and circuit complexity. Empirically, we perform synthetic experiments by training Transformers to simulate a wide variety of automata, and show that shortcut solutions can be learned via standard training. We further investigate the brittleness of these solutions and propose potential mitigations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 120  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hierarchical state management, memory-efficient implementations, hardware-specific optimization techniques, and training stability in hierarchical models, here are some key insights and references from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Hierarchical State Management\n\n- The concept of hierarchical processing is well-demonstrated in the \"Block Transformer\" approach, which adopts hierarchical global-to-local modeling. This method mitigates the KV cache IO bottleneck in batch inference by processing data in a block-wise manner, enhancing inference efficiency in large language models.\n\n- The \"Hierarchical Robot Transformer\" (HiRT) framework also employs hierarchical state management by using a dual-process approach inspired by human cognition. HiRT combines a high-level, slow analytical planning module (System 2) with a low-level, fast reactive module (System 1), allowing for efficient and flexible processing.\n\n- The \"QKFormer\" model, a hierarchical spiking transformer, uses a multi-scale spiking representation achieved through a hierarchical structure. This structure involves different numbers of tokens across blocks, which helps in balancing local and global dependencies efficiently.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Implementations\n\n- The \"Block Transformer\" approach is designed to mitigate memory bottlenecks by using hierarchical global-to-local modeling. This reduces the memory access requirements and improves inference efficiency.\n\n- The \"FlashAttention\" algorithm, mentioned in the analysis note, uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, making it an IO-aware and memory-efficient solution[Analysis Note].\n\n- The \"QKFormer\" model utilizes a novel spike-form Q-K attention module that enables linear complexity and high energy efficiency, which is crucial for memory-efficient transformer implementations.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimization Techniques\n\n- The \"Block Transformer\" emphasizes the importance of IO-aware designs to mitigate the KV cache IO bottleneck, which is a critical hardware-specific optimization.\n\n- The \"HiRT\" framework optimizes performance by keeping the Vision-Language Models (VLMs) running at low frequencies to capture temporarily invariant features, while enabling real-time interaction through a high-frequency vision-based policy. This approach is tailored to balance computational costs and inference latency, making it hardware-aware.\n\n- The \"QKFormer\" model's use of spiking neural networks (SNNs) and spiking patch embedding with deformed shortcut (SPEDS) enhances spiking information transmission and integration, which is optimized for hardware efficiency.\n\n## Training Stability in Hierarchical Models\n\n- The \"HiRT\" framework ensures training stability by decomposing tasks into simpler, more manageable components. It uses hierarchical action planning, where high-level models guide low-level policies, maintaining performance while achieving speed gains.\n\n- For hierarchical transformers, ensuring that the information flow between different levels is carefully designed is crucial for stability. Models like \"Hourglass\" and \"Hierarchical Transformers\" have shown that balancing computation and efficiency can yield stable and efficient results[Analysis Note].\n\n## Implementation Details and Performance Benchmarks\n\n- The \"Block Transformer\" shows significant efficiency improvements in inference by reducing memory access and computational overhead. This is achieved through block-wise processing, which can be benchmarked against traditional transformer models.\n\n- The \"HiRT\" framework demonstrates empirical improvements in both simulation and real-world settings, doubling the control frequency and achieving comparable success rates in static tasks. This highlights the effectiveness of hierarchical processing in real-world applications.\n\n- The \"QKFormer\" model achieves a top-1 accuracy of 85.65% on ImageNet-1k, outperforming other state-of-the-art SNN models. This showcases the performance benefits of hierarchical and spiking transformer architectures.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and robust, with improved hierarchical state management, memory efficiency, hardware optimization, and training stability.\n",
