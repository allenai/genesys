Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAtt attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/38 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nSee App. B for details and to see how to adapt the backward pass in a similar fashion. Overhead. As for the previous method, sorting and re-ordering $\\boldsymbol{Q}, \\boldsymbol{K}$ and $\\boldsymbol{V}$ is inducing some overhead increasing linearly with the sequence length. As shown in our experiments in $\\S 4.2$, this overhead is by large compensated for as the sequence length increases. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_7f5662ba13a7e3d1a640g-06.jpg?height=559&width=1050&top_left_y=474&top_left_x=532)\n\nFigure 3: Comparing several hash-based sparse attention implementations with FlashAttention. Similarly to QK-dropping-based sparsity in Fig. 7, due to the non-triangular causal mask resulting from re-ordering the tensors based on the hash buckets (see Fig. 1), a naive implementation would force the computation of the entire attention matrix before applying a custom mask. This results in very large runtimes independent of the number of buckets. On the other hand, our implementation modifies the basic FlashAttention method to compute only what is required. While there is a cost to reordering the tensors based on the hash buckets, this cost is largely compensated for as the number of buckets $n b$ increases, and as the sequence length increases. ## 4 Experiments \\& Results\n\nIn this section we present our experimental setup and results. We show that (i) unlike naive implementations using existing libraries, our dynamic sparsity attention schemes can significantly improve over the FlashAttention runtime, (ii) this still holds in real-world sequence modeling tasks after factoring in all the non-attention operations, and (iii) it is possible to match-and sometimes outperform-the baselines in terms of perplexity while significantly gaining in speed. ### 4.1 Experimental Setup\n\nDatasets. We test our hash-based sparsity scheme on MNIST (LeCun et al., 1998) for autoregressive image generation, enwik8 (Hutter, 2012), and OpenWebText2 (Gao et al., 2020). We experiment with QK-dropping based sparsity on OpenWebText2. Models \\& Baselines. For our language modeling experiments on OpenWebText2, we use a base autoregressive transformer architecture with 12 layers, a hidden size of 768,12 heads of 64 dimensions each. For experiments on sequence length $T=8192$, we use a batch size of $96=4 \\times 8 \\times 2$ (batch size 4 with 8 accumulation steps and data parallelism over 2 node). When $T=16384$ we use a batch size of $30=2 \\times 5 \\times 3$. The resulting models are of around 122 M parameters. The goal not being to outperform the state-of-the-art perplexity, we train for $15 k$ iterations. The attention modules used are either using FlashAttention for the baselines or one of our sparse kernels for our methods. To ensure a fair comparison, and similarly to Kitaev et al. (2020), we set the keys equal to normalized queries for all of our models.\n```\n\n#### 3. Large Memory Layers with Product Keys (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparse Modular Activation for Efficient Sequence Modeling (Avg. Score: 0.93)\n\n*Liliang Ren, Yang Liu, Shuo Wang, Yichong Xu, Chenguang Zhu, Chengxiang Zhai*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, is designed, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM, and can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear State Space Models (SSMs) have demonstrated strong performance in a variety of sequence modeling tasks due to their efficient encoding of the recurrent structure. However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: sparse parameter access language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

We evaluate the effectiveness of the adapters on fourteen datasets from two different reasoning tasks, Arithmetic Reasoning and Commonsense Reasoning. The results demonstrate that using adapter-based PEFT in smaller-scale LLMs (7B) with few extra trainable parameters yields comparable, and in some cases superior, performance to powerful LLMs (175B) in zero-shot inference on both reasoning tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 143  (*Influential: 15*)\n\n#### 2. Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. A Watermark for Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*John Kirchenbauer, Jonas Geiping, Yuxin Wen, Jonathan Katz, Ian Miers, T. Goldstein*\n\n**TL;DR:** A statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values is proposed, and an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermarks is derived.\n\n**Abstract:** Potential harms of large language models can be mitigated by watermarking model output, i.e., embedding signals into generated text that are invisible to humans but algorithmically detectable from a short span of tokens. We propose a watermarking framework for proprietary language models. The watermark can be embedded with negligible impact on text quality, and can be detected using an efficient open-source algorithm without access to the language model API or parameters. The watermark works by selecting a randomized set of\"green\"tokens before a word is generated, and then softly promoting use of green tokens during sampling. We propose a statistical test for detecting the watermark with interpretable p-values, and derive an information-theoretic framework for analyzing the sensitivity of the watermark. We test the watermark using a multi-billion parameter model from the Open Pretrained Transformer (OPT) family, and discuss robustness and security.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 342  (*Influential: 78*)\n\n#### 4. LongLoRA: Efficient Fine-tuning of Long-Context Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*Yukang Chen, Shengju Qian, Haotian Tang, Xin Lai, Zhijian Liu, Song Han, Jiaya Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA is presented, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2.\n\n**Abstract:** We present LongLoRA, an efficient fine-tuning approach that extends the context sizes of pre-trained large language models (LLMs), with limited computation cost. Typically, training LLMs with long context sizes is computationally expensive, requiring extensive training hours and GPU resources. For example, training on the context length of 8192 needs 16x computational costs in self-attention layers as that of 2048. In this paper, we speed up the context extension of LLMs in two aspects. On the one hand, although dense global attention is needed during inference, fine-tuning the model can be effectively and efficiently done by sparse local attention. The proposed shifted sparse attention effectively enables context extension, leading to non-trivial computation saving with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. Particularly, it can be implemented with only two lines of code in training, while being optional in inference. On the other hand, we revisit the parameter-efficient fine-tuning regime for context expansion. Notably, we find that LoRA for context extension works well under the premise of trainable embedding and normalization. LongLoRA combines this improved LoRA with S^2-Attn. LongLoRA demonstrates strong empirical results on various tasks on Llama2 models from 7B/13B to 70B. LongLoRA extends Llama2 7B from 4k context to 100k, or Llama2 70B to 32k on a single 8x A100 machine. LongLoRA extends models' context while retaining their original architectures, and is compatible with most existing techniques, like Flash-Attention2. In addition, we further conduct supervised fine-tuning with LongLoRA and our long instruction-following LongAlpaca dataset.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 105  (*Influential: 11*)\n\n#### 5. BitFit: Simple Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning for Transformer-based Masked Language-models\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*Elad Ben-Zaken, Shauli Ravfogel, Yoav Goldberg*\n\n**TL;DR:** BitFit is introduced, a sparse-finetuning method where only the bias-terms of the model (or a subset of them) are being modified, which shows that with small-to-medium training data, applying BitFit on pre-trained BERT models is competitive with (and sometimes better than) fine-tuning the entire model.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce BitFit, a sparse-finetuning method where only the bias-terms of the model (or a subset of them) are being modified. We show that with small-to-medium training data, applying BitFit on pre-trained BERT models is competitive with (and sometimes better than) fine-tuning the entire model. For larger data, the method is competitive with other sparse fine-tuning methods.Besides their practical utility, these findings are relevant for the question of understanding the commonly-used process of finetuning: they support the hypothesis that finetuning is mainly about exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training, rather than learning new task-specific linguistic knowledge.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 937  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. JetMoE: Reaching Llama2 Performance with 0.1M Dollars\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*Zengyi Qin, Tianle Cai, Zhen Guo, Yikang Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results, but their increasing resource demand has become a major obstacle to the development of powerful and accessible super-human intelligence. This report introduces JetMoE-8B, a new LLM trained with less than $0.1 million, using 1.25T tokens from carefully mixed open-source corpora and 30,000 H100 GPU hours. Despite its low cost, the JetMoE-8B demonstrates impressive performance, with JetMoE-8B outperforming the Llama2-7B model and JetMoE-8B-Chat surpassing the Llama2-13B-Chat model. These results suggest that LLM training can be much more cost-effective than generally thought. JetMoE-8B is based on an efficient Sparsely-gated Mixture-of-Experts (SMoE) architecture, composed of attention and feedforward experts. Both layers are sparsely activated, allowing JetMoE-8B to have 8B parameters while only activating 2B for each input token, reducing inference computation by about 70% compared to Llama2-7B. Moreover, JetMoE-8B is highly open and academia-friendly, using only public datasets and training code. All training parameters and data mixtures have been detailed in this report to facilitate future efforts in the development of open foundation models. This transparency aims to encourage collaboration and further advancements in the field of accessible and efficient LLMs. The model weights are publicly available at https://github.com/myshell-ai/JetMoE.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-11\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Mixtral 8x7B, a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) language model. Mixtral has the same architecture as Mistral 7B, with the difference that each layer is composed of 8 feedforward blocks (i.e. experts). For every token, at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their outputs. Even though each token only sees two experts, the selected experts can be different at each timestep. As a result, each token has access to 47B parameters, but only uses 13B active parameters during inference. Mixtral was trained with a context size of 32k tokens and it outperforms or matches Llama 2 70B and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. In particular, Mixtral vastly outperforms Llama 2 70B on mathematics, code generation, and multilingual benchmarks. We also provide a model fine-tuned to follow instructions, Mixtral 8x7B - Instruct, that surpasses GPT-3.5 Turbo, Claude-2.1, Gemini Pro, and Llama 2 70B - chat model on human benchmarks.

Scaling Expert Language Models with Unsupervised Domain Discovery\n\n*From Search Query: sparse parameter access language models*\n\n*Luke Zettlemoyer, Noah A. Smith, Tim Althoff, Weijia Shi, Mike Lewis, Margaret Li, Suchin Gururangan*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models are typically trained densely: all parameters are updated with respect to all inputs. This requires synchronization of billions of parameters across thousands of GPUs. We introduce a simple but effective method to asynchronously train large, sparse language models on arbitrary text corpora. Our method clusters a corpus into sets of related documents, trains a separate expert language model on each cluster, and combines them in a sparse ensemble for inference. This approach generalizes embarrassingly parallel training by automatically discovering the domains for each expert, and eliminates nearly all the communication overhead of existing sparse language models. Our technique outperforms dense baselines on multiple corpora and few-shot tasks, and our analysis shows that specializing experts to meaningful clusters is key to these gains. Performance also improves with the number of experts and size of training data, suggesting this is a highly efficient and accessible approach to training large language models.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-24\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on sparse parameter access, memory efficiency, and computational overhead, here are some key implementations and techniques that can be considered:\n\n## Mixture of Experts (MoE) and Sparse Parameter Access\n\n### Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)\nModels like Mixtral 8x7B utilize a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) architecture. In this setup, each layer consists of multiple experts, but only a subset of these experts is activated for each token. This approach significantly reduces the computational overhead and memory usage during inference.\n\n- **Router Network**: A router network selects the most relevant experts for each token, ensuring that only a fraction of the total parameters are used at any given time. This technique allows for a large number of parameters to be available without activating all of them simultaneously, thus reducing the active parameters needed during inference.\n\n### Memory Efficiency\n- **Sparse Parameters vs. Active Parameters**: In MoE models, while the entire model with all experts needs to be loaded into memory, only a subset of experts (active parameters) is used during inference. For example, Mixtral 8x7B has 47B parameters but only uses 13B active parameters during inference, making it computationally cheaper and faster.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Retrieval and Generation\n\n### Hypernetworks\nHypernetworks, as seen in models like HyperMixer, can dynamically generate weights for the model. This approach allows for efficient computation paths and can reduce the need for storing large static weight matrices.\n\n- **Dynamic Weight Generation**: Hypernetworks can form token mixing MLPs dynamically, achieving results comparable to Transformers but at lower computational costs. This dynamic generation can help in adapting to varying input patterns and reducing the memory footprint (though the specific reference is not provided here, the concept aligns with the analysis note).\n\n## Memory-Efficient Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Activation Sparsity\nTechniques like TEAL (Training-Free Activation Sparsity in LLMs) can be applied to reduce computational overhead by introducing activation sparsity.\n\n- **Magnitude-Based Sparsification**: TEAL applies magnitude-based activation sparsity to hidden states throughout the model, achieving 40-50% model-wide sparsity. This reduces the compute and memory movement required for matrix multiplications, leading to significant speed-ups during inference.\n\n## Product Key Techniques and Sparse Retrieval\n\n### Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval\nThe concept of product key techniques, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be applied to efficiently retrieve parameters from a vast pool of experts.\n\n- **PEER (Parameter Efficient Expert Retrieval)**: This technique uses product keys for sparse retrieval from a large pool of tiny experts, enabling efficient handling of large parameter spaces. This can be integrated into MoE architectures to further optimize parameter access[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hybrid Approaches\n\n### Combining Sparse Retrieval with Dynamic Memory\nA hybrid approach that combines sparse retrieval mechanisms with dynamic memory management can offer significant improvements.\n\n- **Sparse MoE with Dynamic Memory**: Combining the sparse MoE architecture with dynamic memory mechanisms, such as those using learnable memories (as in SMR: State Memory Replay), can enhance model stability, generalization, and efficiency. This hybrid approach can optimize memory update mechanisms and maintain compatibility with existing LM architectures[Analysis Note].\n\nBy integrating these techniques\u2014sparse MoE, dynamic parameter generation via hypernetworks, activation sparsity, and product key-based sparse retrieval\u2014the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is highly efficient in terms of memory usage and computational overhead, while maintaining or improving the model's expressiveness and performance.\n",

Large Memory Layers with Product Keys (Avg. Score: 0.98)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/21 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nAll these operations can be implemented using auto-differentiation mechanisms, making our layer pluggable at any location in a neural network. Operations (2), (3) only depend on the top-k indices and are therefore computationally efficient. In contrast, the exhaustive comparison of Equation (1) is not efficient for large memories since it involves computing $|\\mathcal{K}|$ inner products. To circumvent this issue, we resort to a structured set of keys, that we refer to as product keys. The product key set is defined as the outer product, with respect to the vector concatenation operator, of two vector codebooks $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ :\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{K}=\\left\\{\\left(c, c^{\\prime}\\right) \\mid c \\in \\mathcal{C}, c^{\\prime} \\in \\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nThe total number of keys induced by this Cartesian product construction is $|\\mathcal{K}|=|\\mathcal{C}| \\times\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$. The sets $\\mathcal{C}$ and $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ both comprise a set of sub-keys of dimension $d_{\\mathrm{q}} / 2$. We exploit this structure to compute the closest keys $\\mathcal{I} \\in(1, \\ldots, K)$ efficiently. First, we split the query $q(x)$ into two sub-queries $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$. We then compute the $k$ sub-keys in $\\mathcal{C}$ (resp. $\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}$ ) closest to the sub-query $q_{1}$ (resp. $q_{2}$ ):\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}}=\\mathcal{T}_{k}\\left(\\left(q_{1}(x)^{T} c_{i}\\right)_{i \\in\\{1 \\ldots|\\mathcal{C}|\\}}\\right), \\quad \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}}=\\mathcal{T}_{k}\\left(\\left(q_{2}(x)^{T} c_{j}^{\\prime}\\right)_{j \\in\\left\\{1 \\ldots\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|\\right\\}}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe are guaranteed that the $k$ most similar keys in $\\mathcal{K}$ are of the form $\\left\\{\\left(c_{i}, c_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\mid i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}}, j \\in \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}}\\right\\}$. An example of product keys with the key selection process is shown in Figure 2. ### 3.2 Complexity\n\nSearching for the top-k most similar keys when the keys have a flat representation requires $|\\mathcal{K}|$ comparisons of vectors of size $d_{\\mathrm{q}}$, i.e. $\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\mathcal{K}| \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right)$ operations. For product keys, we consider the setup where $|\\mathcal{C}|=\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$, i.e. the configuration that maximizes $|\\mathcal{C}| \\times\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$ for a fixed number of sub-keys $|\\mathcal{C}|+\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$. Since $|\\mathcal{K}|=|\\mathcal{C}| \\times\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$, we have $|\\mathcal{C}|=\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|}$. We only need to compare the two sub-queries with $|\\mathcal{C}|$ and $\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right|$ sub-keys of size $d_{\\mathrm{q}} / 2$, which amounts to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\mathcal{C}| \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}} / 2+\\left|\\mathcal{C}^{\\prime}\\right| \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}} / 2\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(|\\mathcal{C}| \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right)=\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|} \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right)$ operations. Then, we need to search for the top-k keys in $\\left\\{\\left(c_{i}, c_{j}^{\\prime}\\right) \\mid i \\in \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}}, j \\in \\mathcal{I}_{\\mathcal{C}}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$, which is a set composed of $k^{2}$ keys of dimension $d_{\\mathrm{q}}$. This can be done in $\\mathcal{O}\\left(k^{2} \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right)$ operations (in practice, this could be\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_cfa6caed5f8792f4a32fg-05.jpg?height=167&width=1394&top_left_y=231&top_left_x=363)\n\nFigure 3: Left: A typical transformer block is composed by a self-attention layer followed by an FFN layer (a two layer network). Right: In our system, we replace the FFN layer with a product key memory layer, which is analogous to a sparse FFN layer with a very large hidden state. In practice, we only replace the FFN layer in $N$ layers, where typically $N \\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. done in $\\mathcal{O}(k \\log k)$ scalar operations with a priority list [1], but this choice is less compliant with GPU architectures). As a result, the overall complexity is:\n\n$$\n\\mathcal{O}\\left(\\left(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|}+k^{2}\\right) \\times d_{\\mathrm{q}}\\right)\n$$\n\nFor small values of $k$, and a memory of size $|\\mathcal{K}|=1024^{2}$, retrieving the nearest product keys requires about $10^{3}$ less operations than an exhaustive search. As shown later in our ablation study, product keys also lead to a better performance compared to a set composed of flat keys. ### 3.3 Multi-head memory attention\n\nWe make the model more expressive with a multi-head mechanism, where each head independently computes a query used to select $k$ keys from the memory. The memory simply sums the output $m_{i}(x)$ of each head $i: m(x)=\\sum_{i=1}^{H} m_{i}(x)$ where $H$ is the number of heads. Each head has its own query network and its own set of sub-keys, but all heads share the same values. This is similar to the multi-head attention used in transformers, except that we do not split the query into $H$ heads, but instead create $H$ queries. As the query networks are independent from each other and randomly initialized, they often map the same input to very different values of the memory. In practice, for the same input we observe very little overlap between the keys selected by two different heads. This method let us increase key usage and generally improves performance. The impact of the multi-head attention mechanism is discussed in Section 4.5. ## 4 Experiments\n\nWe report results on large-scale experiments for transformer models equipped with a memory, followed by an ablation study that shows the impact of different memory components on the model performance and memory usage. We propose to replace the FFN block of some transformer layers by a memory, as presented in Figure 3 In that setting, the memory is integrated with a residual connection in the network, and the input $x$ to the memory layer becomes $x \\leftarrow x+\\operatorname{PKM}(x)$ instead of $x \\leftarrow x+\\operatorname{FFN}(x)$. In practice, we could also keep the FFN layer and simply interleave the memory between some transformer layers. ### 4.1 Dataset\n\nWe evaluate the impact of our memory in a large scale language modeling task, where traditional models are known to underfit. The largest publicly available language modeling dataset is the One Billion Word corpus [4]. As noted in prior work [2, 9, 36], obtaining a good performance on this dataset requires tedious regularization as it is now too small for standard architectures. In our experiments, we encountered the same issues, and observed that even a small model was enough to overfit: on this dataset, for a 16 layers model with a dimensionality of 1024 , we obtain a test perplexity of 25.3 when the validation perplexity starts to increase. The train perplexity is then equal to 14.8 and keeps improving while the validation perplexity deteriorates. We therefore evaluate the benefit of our approach on a corpus that is 30 times larger and extracted from the public Common Crawl. The training set is composed of 28 billion words ( 140 GB of data) extracted from about 40 million English news articles indexed by Common Crawl corpora. The validation and test sets are both composed of 5000 news articles removed from the training set. Unlike in the One Billion Word corpus, we did not shuffle sentences, allowing the model to learn long range dependencies. On this dataset, we did not observe any overfitting, and increasing the\nmodel capacity systematically led to a better performance on the validation set. We tokenized the data using the tokenizer provided by the Moses toolkit [26]. To reduce the vocabulary size, we use fastBPE ${ }^{5}$ to apply Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) [39], with 60k BPE splits. ### 4.2 Evaluation metrics\n\nWe measure the performance of our models by reporting the perplexity on the test set. For models with memories, we report two different metrics to evaluate the usage:\n\n- The memory usage that represents the fraction of accessed values: $\\#\\left\\{z_{i} \\neq 0\\right\\}$\n- The KL divergence between $z$ and the uniform distribution: $\\log (|\\mathcal{K}|)+\\sum z_{i} \\log \\left(z_{i}\\right)$\nwhere $z=z^{\\prime} /\\left\\|z^{\\prime}\\right\\|_{1}$, and $z^{\\prime} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{|\\mathcal{K}|}$ is defined as $z_{i}^{\\prime}=\\sum_{x} w(x)_{i}$ where $w(x)$ represents the weights of the keys accessed in the memory when the network is fed with an input $x$ from the test set (i.e., the $w(x)$ are sparse with at most $H \\times k$ non-zero elements). At test time, we expect the model to access as many keys as possible, i.e. to have a usage near $100 \\%$; a lower usage means that part of the capacity is not exploited at all. The KL divergence reflects imbalance in the access patterns to the memory: if the model attends the same key for every query (while giving a tiny weight to the remaining keys), it would give a perfect usage but a very high KL, showing that the same performance could be achieved with just one value. ### 4.3 Training details\n\nWe use a transformer architecture with 16 attention heads and learned positional embeddings. We consider models with 12,16 or 24 layers, with either 1024 or 1600 dimensions. We train our models with the Adam optimizer [25], with a learning rate of $2.5 \\times 10^{-4}$, with $\\beta_{1}=0.9, \\beta_{2}=0.98$, following the learning rate schedule of Vaswani et al. [44]. In the memory, the keys and the query network are learned with the same optimizer and learning rate as the rest of the network. Since the memory values are learned with sparse updates, we found it beneficial to learn them with a higher Adam learning rate of $10^{-3}$. We implement our models with PyTorch [35], and train them on 32 Volta GPUs. We use float 16 operations to speed up training and to reduce the GPU memory usage of our models. To retrieve key indices efficiently, we perform the search over sub-keys with a fast nearest neighbors implementation by Johnson et al. [22]. For a transformer model with $L$ layers and $N$ memories, we interspersed the memories at regular intervals. For instance, for $L=16$ and $N=2$, we replace the FFN of layers 6 and 12.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/21 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nUnfortunately, the fast access to memories rely on an approximate external indexing structure [32] that has to be re-learned periodically. Our work solves this issue by fully incorporating the key selection mechanism as a network component. The transformer network [44] is the current workhorse of Natural Language Processing (NLP): it is employed ubiquitously across a large variety of tasks. Transformers are built by stacking blocks composed of self-attention layers followed by fully connected layers (dubbed FFN), as shown in Figure 3 The components of the memory layer bear similarities to the query, key and value networks used in self-attention layers with two notable differences: the keys and values do not correspond to input tokens but are free embedding vectors, and the number of values (memory size) is very large. ## 3 Learnable product key memories\n\nWe consider the design of a function $m: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that will act as a layer in a neural network. The purpose of $m$ is to offer a large capacity within a neural network. ### 3.1 Memory design\n\nHigh-level structure. The overall structure of our memory is illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 . The memory is composed of three components: a query network, a key selection module containing two sets of sub-keys, and a value lookup table. It first computes a query that is compared to the set of product keys. For each product key, it computes a score and selects the $k$ product keys with the highest scores. The scores are then used to produce an output $m(x)$ via a weighted sum over the values associated with the selected keys. All the parameters of the memory are trainable, yet only $k$ memory slots are updated for each input. The sparse selection and parameter update make both training and inference very efficient. Query generation: pre-processing network. The function $q: x \\mapsto q(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{q}}$, referred to as the query network, maps the $d$-dimensional input to a latent space of dimensionality $d_{\\mathrm{q}}$. Typically, $q$ is a linear mapping or a multi-layer perceptron that reduces the dimensionality from $d$ to $d_{\\mathrm{q}}=$ 512. As keys are randomly initialized, they occupy the space relatively uniformly. Adding a batch normalization layer on the top of the query network helps increasing key coverage during training. This insight is confirmed by our ablation experiments in Section 4.5\n\nStandard key assignment and weighting. Let $q(x)$ be a query and $\\mathcal{T}_{k}$ denote the top-k operator ${ }^{4}$ Given a set of keys $\\mathcal{K}=\\left\\{k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{|\\mathcal{K}|}\\right\\}$ composed of $|\\mathcal{K}| d_{d_{q}}$-dimensional vectors, and an input $x$,\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_cfa6caed5f8792f4a32fg-04.jpg?height=419&width=1271&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=425)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the product keys. We define two discrete subsets of keys (sub-key set 1 and sub-key set 2). They induce a much larger set of keys, which are never made explicit (product keys). Given a query, we split it into two sub-queries ( $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ ). Selecting the $k$ closest keys ( $k=2$ in the figure) in each subset implicitly selects $k \\times k$ keys. The $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query are guaranteed to belong to this subset, on which the search can be done efficiently. we select the top $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query $q(x)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I} & =\\mathcal{T}_{k}\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Get k nearest neighbors } \\\\\nw & =\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right)_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Normalize top-k scores } \\\\\nm(x) & =\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} w_{i} v_{i} & & \\text { \\# Aggregate selected values }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathcal{I}$ denotes the indices of the $k$ most similar keys (where the similarity measure is the inner product), and $w$ is the vector that represents the normalized scores associated with the selected keys.\n```\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training (Avg.

However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 47/51 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nZhang, Y. and Cai, D.

Linear attention mechanisms (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) replace $\\exp \\left(\\boldsymbol{q}_{t} \\boldsymbol{k}_{i}^{\\top}\\right)$ with a kernel $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})$ having an associated feature map $\\phi$ (i.e., $k(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{y})=\\langle\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}), \\phi(\\boldsymbol{y})\\rangle$ ) where $\\phi \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{key}}} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{d_{\\mathrm{dot}}}$. $\\phi$ often consists of two parts: $\\phi=\\phi_{0} \\circ \\phi_{1}$. $\\phi_{1}$ could be a linear map made up by random samples (Peng et al., 2021; Choromanski et al., 2021), learnable MLPs (Kasai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) or simply an identity map (Mao, 2022). $\\phi_{2}$ is often an element-wise (activation) function that makes the resulting $\\phi$ a positive feature map, such as $1+\\mathrm{elu}$ (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), ReLU (Kasai et al., 2021), $\\exp (\\cdot)$ (Zhang et al., 2024; Choromanski et al., 2021). Some work (Qin et al., 2023b; Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022) suggests that a positive feature map might not be necessary. Our work follows Sun et al. (2023a) and Mao (2022) by using an identity map $\\phi=\\mathbf{I}$. Recent work suggests that non-identity feature maps such as scaled element-wise exponential map (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) and higher-order polynomial map (Arora et al., 2024; Kacham et al., 2023) work well empirically. We leave the exploration of integrating other types of feature map into GLA to future work. Attention spikiness. Linear attention suffers from the \"attention dilution\" issue (Qin et al., 2022), where the attention distribution is too uniform (i.e., high entropy) to concentrate on relevant tokens. Qin et al. (2022) propose adding local attention layers to focus more on adjacent tokens, a method adopted in (Lingle, 2023; Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) and proven crucial for performance. Recent work finds that a scaled element-wise exponential map-i.e., $\\phi(\\mathbf{x})=\\exp (t \\cdot \\mathbf{x})$ with $t \\geq 2$-helps to concentrate attention (Nahshan et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024). Zhang et al. (2024) also find that higher-order polynomial kernels induce low-entropy and spiky attention distribution, partially explaining the empirical success of Based Linear Attention (Arora et al., 2024) and PolySketchFormer (Kacham et al., 2023). Memory capacity. Linear attention has bounded memory size (Peng et al., 2022) while softmax attention enjoys unbounded memory(Oren et al., 2024). We believe that increasing the memory size efficiently and utilizing memory effectively are the keys to bridging the performance gap between linear attention and softmax attention. To increase memory size, it is shown that directly increasing $d_{\\text {key }}$ is effective (Sun et al., 2023a; Mao, 2022; Zhang \\& Cai, 2022); however, the total parameters are hard to control with the increase of $d_{\\text {key }}$. Parameter-efficient methods often keep $d_{\\text {key }}$ intact and increase $d_{\\text {dot }}$ instead. Higher order polynomial kernels with order $p \\geq 2$ map $d_{\\text {key }}$ to a much higher $d_{\\text {dot }}=O\\left(d_{\\text {key }}^{p}\\right)$ (Arora et al., 2023a; Kacham et al., 2023). Schlag et al. (2021) propose the Deterministic Parameter-Free Projection (DPFP), while Pramanik et al. (2023) use parameterized outer product to expand $d_{\\text {dot }}$ in a parameter-efficient/free manner.\n```\n\n#### 3. Recurrent Memory Transformer (Avg.

The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures.

Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded.

However, transformer performance on many of these tasks is limited by the context length of attention, which is typically short. The ability to attend to far-away tokens is important in many situations. In novels, characters and events are referenced across multiple chapters. In source code, references to classes and functions may occur quite far from the places in which they are defined. In theorem proving, proofs make use of previously defined lemmas. Attention over long sequences is also useful as a form of rapid learning. Facts and information which are stored in the form of weight matrices must be slowly trained over hundreds of thousands of training steps. By using attention, however, a model can simply memorize facts (e.g. function definitions) by storing them as (key, value) pairs in long-term memory, and then retrieve those facts later by creating a query that attends to them. In this case, attention acts as a form of information retrieval, allowing the model to look up facts that it has seen previously. We demonstrate that a simple and effective way to increase the size of the attention context is to use approximate $k$-nearest-neighbor ( $k \\mathrm{NN})$ lookup, which is widely used in information retrieval. A number of extremely scalable implementations of $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup are available, such as ScaNN Guo et al., 2020) and Faiss (Johnson et al. 2021). There are two things which distinguish our approach from previous work on long-range attention (c.f. Section 22. First, unlike some other approaches, $k$ NN lookup does not do averaging or summarization of tokens at long distances, but retrieves exact values even from the distant context. Second, gradients are not backpropagated into the external memory, which is critical to the scalability of our technique. The keys and values are a function of model parameters, so attempting to backpropagate gradients into external memory would necessarily involve computing all of the keys and values with the current model parameters on every training step. However, if the external memory is not differentiable, then we can instead instead reuse keys and values that were previously computed on prior training steps, which drastically reduces the amount of computation for large memories.

We show that model perplexity steadily improves with the size of external memory on a variety of language modelling tasks, including C 4 (long documents only), Github code repositories, PG-19 books, formal proofs in Isabelle, and arXiv math papers. We further show that models can generalize to larger memory sizes than they were trained on: models trained with a small memory show gains from using a much larger memory at inference time. Finally, we show that our models are actually using memory in the way that we had hoped, e.g. by looking up the definitions of lemmas in a theorem proving corpus. The simplicity of the changes to the Transformer architecture allows us to easily integrate this approach into existing code bases, including extremely large language models. We further show that the improvements to quality are maintained across models of increasing size, and that the model improvements gained from adding memory are even larger than increasing the size of the model by 5 X or more as shown in Figure 1\n\n## 2 RELATED WORK\n\nA great deal of work has been done on efficient long-range attention mechanisms; see Tay et al. (2020, 2021) recent surveys. Sliding windows (Beltagy et al. 2020) use a long sequence, but attend within a smaller window, thus reducing complexity to the window size, rather than total sequence length. Approximate mechanisms such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2020b), and Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) refactor the attention matrix by using a different kernel than softmax to obtain $O(N)$ complexity. Pooling strategies such as Hierarchical 1D attention (Zhu \\& Soricut 2021), and Combiner (Ren et al. 2021) apply pooling or averaging over tokens at longer distances. Sparse strategies such as Big Bird (Zaheer et al. 2020) select only a subset of tokens to attend to; Routing Transformers (Roy et al., 2021) use clustering to select the subset, while Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020) relies on hashing. Hierarchical mechanisms (Ainslie et al., 2020) combine multiple tokens into phrases or sentences to reduce sequence length. Expire-span (Sukhbaatar et al., 2021) prunes far-away tokens that it learns are \"unimportant\". Zemlyanskiy et al., 2021) process long sequences in two passes with different encoders. The second pass is given a lot of context by accessing summaries of the first pass. Feedback transformers (Fan et al. 2020) use a recurrent architecture in which each token attends to the output of the final layer instead of the previous layer. Recurrence does not increase the size of the attention context itself, but it expands the receptive field at the cost of parallelism and training speed. Truncated backpropagation through time (Williams \\& Peng, 1990) was originally introduced as a way of training recurrent neural networks (RNN) over very long sequences, when the entire sequence does not fit in memory. The sequence is chopped into segments, and after each training step, the final RNN state for the segment is saved in a non-differentiable cache, and used as the initial state on the next training step. Neural caches Grave et al. 2017) extend the cache to contain a record of many prior hidden states, and attend over them. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) applies this technique to transformers; it caches the (key,value) pairs computed from the previous training step, and uses them as a prefix for the tokens on the next training step, which yields significant gains on long documents. Rae et al. (2020) improve over Transformer-XL by compressing the tokens before adding them to the\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1ef7ca414da07969fba6g-03.jpg?height=665&width=1052&top_left_y=253&top_left_x=512)\n\nFigure 2: We extend Transformers with access to (key, value) pairs of previously seen subsequences. cache. In contrast, we use a very large cache without compression, combined with an approximate $k \\mathrm{NN}$ attention mechanism over it. Sukhbaatar et al. (2019) make the observation that the feed-forward portion of a transformer layer functions very much like attention if one replaces the ReLU activation with softmax. They implement a combined attention over both tokens from the input sequence and a learned (and differentiable) \"memory\". Lample et al. (2019) exploit this observation to replace the feed-forward layers (FFNs) with a fast $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup over a much larger \"memory\", and achieve large gains in model accuracy without significant computation overhead. (We use $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to approximate attention to previous tokens, not to replace the FFN.)\n\nNon-differentiable external memory has been used in different ways by Khandelwal et al. (2020), who run a pre-trained model over an entire corpus, and construct a large table of (key, token) pairs. They then use that table to replace the final softmax layer for token selection in the model, which results in significant improvements in language modeling. Yogatama et al. (2021) extend this approach by a gating mechanism and a process to compress the context into keys for retrieval. There are several works that combine retrieval with transformers. REALM (Guu et al., 2020), MARGE (Lewis et al., 2020a), RAG (Lewis et al. 2020b), and composite memory for dialog (Fan et al. 2021) retrieve documents from a knowledge base to improve question answering or dialogue. The knowledge base consists of text snippets and is static and typically separate from the inputs and outputs of the models. Instead, we focus on language modeling using a decoder-only model, and propose a simple model that unifies attention and retrieval. $k$-nearest-neighbor lookup is a general-purpose technique that is used for a wide variety of machine learning and retrieval tasks, and high-performance implementations are available for various architectures (Johnson et al., 2021, Guo et al., 2020). Memory-efficient Transformers (Gupta et al, 2021) replace dense attention with a $k \\mathrm{NN}$ lookup to increase speed and reduce memory usage. ## 3 METHOD\n\nThe architecture of our $k \\mathrm{NN}$-augmented transformer is shown in Figure 2 The bulk of the model is a vanilla, decoder-only transformer (Vaswani et al.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: product key memory transformer implementation\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 \u2192 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*SHIYANG LI, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** First, convolutional self-attention is proposed by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism, and LogSparse Transformer is proposed, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$ memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1182  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n#### 3. Segmented Recurrent Transformer: An Efficient Sequence-to-Sequence Model\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Yinghan Long, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Kaushik Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** A segmented recurrent transformer that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention that achieves higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown dominant performance across a range of domains including language and vision. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with the sequence length, making their usage prohibitive for resource-constrained applications. To counter this, our approach is to divide the whole sequence into segments and apply attention to the individual segments. We propose a segmented recurrent transformer (SRformer) that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention. The loss caused by reducing the attention window length is compensated by aggregating information across segments with recurrent attention. SRformer leverages Recurrent Accumulate-and-Fire (RAF) neurons' inherent memory to update the cumulative product of keys and values. The segmented attention and lightweight RAF neurons ensure the efficiency of the proposed transformer. Such an approach leads to models with sequential processing capability at a lower computation/memory cost. We apply the proposed method to T5 and BART transformers. The modified models are tested on summarization datasets including CNN-dailymail, XSUM, ArXiv, and MediaSUM. Notably, using segmented inputs of varied sizes, the proposed model achieves $6-22\\%$ higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches.

J\u00e9gou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 5. Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. TeraPool-SDR: An 1.89TOPS 1024 RV-Cores 4MiB Shared-L1 Cluster for Next-Generation Open-Source Software-Defined Radios\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Radio Access Networks (RAN) workloads are rapidly scaling up in data processing intensity and throughput as the 5G (and beyond) standards grow in number of antennas and sub-carriers. Offering flexible Processing Elements (PEs), efficient memory access, and a productive parallel programming model, many-core clusters are a well-matched architecture for next-generation software-defined RANs, but staggering performance requirements demand a high number of PEs coupled with extreme Power, Performance and Area (PPA) efficiency. We present the architecture, design, and full physical implementation of Terapool-SDR, a cluster for Software Defined Radio (SDR) with 1024 latency-tolerant, compact RV32 PEs, sharing a global view of a 4MiB, 4096-banked, L1 memory. We report various feasible configurations of TeraPool-SDR featuring an ultra-high bandwidth PE-to-L1-memory interconnect, clocked at 730MHz, 880MHz, and 924MHz (TT/0.80 V/25 {\\deg}C) in 12nm FinFET technology. The TeraPool-SDR cluster achieves high energy efficiency on all SDR key kernels for 5G RANs: Fast Fourier Transform (93GOPS/W), Matrix-Multiplication (125GOPS/W), Channel Estimation (96GOPS/W), and Linear System Inversion (61GOPS/W). For all the kernels, it consumes less than 10W, in compliance with industry standards.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-08\n\n\n\n#### 2. Theory, Analysis, and Best Practices for Sigmoid Self-Attention\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Russ Webb, Amitis Shidani, Zijin Gu, Jagrit Digani, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Pierre Ablin, Dan Busbridge, Floris Weers, Eeshan Dhekane, Federico Danieli, Jason Ramapuram*\n\n**Abstract:** Attention is a key part of the transformer architecture. It is a sequence-to-sequence mapping that transforms each sequence element into a weighted sum of values. The weights are typically obtained as the softmax of dot products between keys and queries. Recent work has explored alternatives to softmax attention in transformers, such as ReLU and sigmoid activations. In this work, we revisit sigmoid attention and conduct an in-depth theoretical and empirical analysis. Theoretically, we prove that transformers with sigmoid attention are universal function approximators and benefit from improved regularity compared to softmax attention. Through detailed empirical analysis, we identify stabilization of large initial attention norms during the early stages of training as a crucial factor for the successful training of models with sigmoid attention, outperforming prior attempts. We also introduce FLASHSIGMOID, a hardware-aware and memory-efficient implementation of sigmoid attention yielding a 17% inference kernel speed-up over FLASHATTENTION2 on H100 GPUs. Experiments across language, vision, and speech show that properly normalized sigmoid attention matches the strong performance of softmax attention on a wide range of domains and scales, which previous attempts at sigmoid attention were unable to fully achieve. Our work unifies prior art and establishes best practices for sigmoid attention as a drop-in softmax replacement in transformers.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-06\n\n\n\n#### 3. QJL: 1-Bit Quantized JL Transform for KV Cache Quantization with Zero Overhead\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer implementation*\n\n*Insu Han, Majid Daliri, Amir Zandieh*\n\n**Abstract:** Serving LLMs requires substantial memory due to the storage requirements of Key-Value (KV) embeddings in the KV cache, which grows with sequence length. An effective approach to compress KV cache is quantization. However, traditional quantization methods face significant memory overhead due to the need to store quantization constants (at least a zero point and a scale) in full precision per data block. Depending on the block size, this overhead can add 1 or 2 bits per quantized number. We introduce QJL, a new quantization approach that consists of a Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) transform followed by sign-bit quantization. In contrast to existing methods, QJL eliminates memory overheads by removing the need for storing quantization constants. We propose an asymmetric estimator for the inner product of two vectors and demonstrate that applying QJL to one vector and a standard JL transform without quantization to the other provides an unbiased estimator with minimal distortion. We have developed an efficient implementation of the QJL sketch and its corresponding inner product estimator, incorporating a lightweight CUDA kernel for optimized computation. When applied across various LLMs and NLP tasks to quantize the KV cache to only 3 bits, QJL demonstrates a more than fivefold reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising accuracy, all while achieving faster runtime. Codes are available at \\url{https://github.com/amirzandieh/QJL}.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-05\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the implementation of product key memory in transformer architectures, here are some key insights and details from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Memory Organization and Key-Value Storage\n\n### Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)\nIn the context of transformer models, the work on NAMMs introduces a novel memory evolution framework that optimizes the latent memory KV cache. This approach involves managing the memory of transformers directly, allowing for distinct contexts to be provided to each latent level independently. NAMMs are conditioned on features constructed from the attention matrix, making them universally applicable to any transformer-based architecture. This method reduces the number of retained tokens in the KV cache, leading to efficiency benefits without compromising performance.\n\n### Product Key Memory Structures\nProduct key memory structures, as discussed in the analysis note, enable fast exact nearest neighbor search. These structures are efficient for finding the closest keys to the input, typically requiring \\(O(\\sqrt{|K|})\\) vector comparisons. This approach ensures that all memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input during training. This method is particularly useful for large memory layers, allowing for efficient parameter retrieval from large memory spaces with negligible computational overhead [Analysis Note].\n\n## Integration with Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Attention Matrix and KV Cache Management\nThe NAMMs framework acts on the KV cache to improve both performance and practicality of transformer models. By extracting features from the attention matrix, NAMMs can optimize the attention mechanism, allowing individual layers and attention heads to focus on the most relevant information. This approach is compared to other KV cache management methods like H2O and L2, showing superior performance and efficiency across various long-context language modeling benchmarks.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nSparse attention mechanisms, such as SPARSEK Attention, integrate a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator to select a constant number of KV pairs for each query. This approach offers linear time complexity and a constant memory footprint, which is crucial for efficient memory access patterns and computational optimizations. Integrating such sparse attention mechanisms with product key memory structures can further enhance the efficiency of the model[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Update Strategies\n\n### Efficient Chunking and Memory Access\nEfficient chunking and memory access patterns are essential for handling long sequences. Techniques like PagedAttention optimize memory allocation by utilizing non-contiguous memory blocks, alleviating constraints associated with memory management during inference. This approach ensures that memory access is efficient and does not become a bottleneck.\n\n### Dynamic Memory Updates\nIn the context of NAMMs, the memory is updated dynamically based on the attention matrix. This dynamic update strategy ensures that the most relevant information is retained and updated at each step, optimizing the memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\n## Computational Optimizations\n\n### Hardware-Aware Implementations\nHardware-aware implementations, such as the use of memristor-based in-memory computing, can significantly accelerate transformer self-attention operations. This approach leverages analog computation integrated into memory, reducing computational latency and energy consumption. For example, memristor-based designs can achieve a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts.\n\n### Quantization and Layer Fusion\nTechniques like quantization and layer fusion, as supported by frameworks like CTranslate2, can reduce the model size and speed up inference. Quantization lowers the precision of weights, while layer fusion combines multiple layers into a single operation, minimizing overhead and maximizing GPU utilization.\n\nBy integrating these strategies\u2014product key memory structures, sparse attention mechanisms, efficient memory access patterns, dynamic memory updates, and hardware-aware computational optimizations\u2014researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n#### 2. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/38 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nFor these applications, the causal self-attention-which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern.

Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0 \\times$ and $3.3 \\times$ for sequences of respectively $8 k$ and $16 k$ tokens. ## 1 Introduction\n\nMany methods have been developed to mitigate the quadratic cost of self-attention in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 3. Reformer: The Efficient Transformer (Avg. Score: 0.79)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.79)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 4. Efficient Long Sequence Modeling via State Space Augmented Transformer (Avg.

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Burtsev*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 68  (*Influential: 10*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Recurrent Memory Transformer is a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based models show their effectiveness across multiple domains and tasks. The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.76)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Linearizing Transformer with Key-Value Memory\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Yizhe Zhang, Deng Cai*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient transformer variants with linear time complexity have been developed to mitigate the quadratic computational overhead of the vanilla transformer. Among them are low-rank projection methods such as Linformer and kernel-based Transformers. Despite their unique merits, they usually suffer from a performance drop comparing with the vanilla transformer on many sequence generation tasks, and often fail to obtain computation gain when the generation is short. We propose Memsizer, an approach towards closing the performance gap while improving the efficiency even with short generation. It projects the source sequences into lower dimension representations like Linformer, while enjoying efficient recurrent-style incremental computation similar to kernel-based transformers. This yields linear computation time and constant memory complexity at inference time. Memsizer also employs a lightweight multi-head mechanism which renders the computation as light as a single-head model. We demonstrate that Memsizer provides an improved balance between efficiency and accuracy over the vanilla transformer and other efficient transformer variants in three typical sequence generation tasks, including machine translation, abstractive text summarization, and language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) is proposed \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Abstract:** Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 \u2192 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. MECTA: Memory-Economic Continual Test-Time Model Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Junyuan Hong, Lingjuan Lyu, Jiayu Zhou, Michael Spranger*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-time Adaptation (CTA) is a promising art to secure accuracy gains in continually-changing environments. The state-of-the-art adaptations improve out-of-distribution model accuracy via computation-efficient online test-time gradient descents but meanwhile cost about times of memory versus the inference, even if only a small portion of parameters are updated. Such high memory consumption of CTA substantially impedes wide applications of advanced CTA on memory-constrained devices. In this paper, we provide a novel solution, dubbed MECTA, to drastically improve the memory efficiency of gradient-based CTA. Our profiling shows that the major memory overhead comes from the intermediate cache for back-propagation, which scales by the batch size, channel, and layer number. Therefore, we propose to reduce batch sizes, adopt an adaptive normalization layer to maintain stable and accurate predictions, and stop the back-propagation caching heuristically. On the other hand, we prune the networks to reduce the computation and memory overheads in optimization and recover the parameters afterward to avoid forgetting. The proposed MECTA is efficient and can be seamlessly plugged into state-of-the-art CTA algorithms at negligible overhead on computation and memory. On three datasets, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet, MECTA improves the accuracy by at least 6% with constrained memory and significantly reduces the memory costs of ResNet50 on ImageNet by at least 70% with comparable accuracy.

Sparse Universal Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Shawn Tan, Yikang Shen, Zhenfang Chen, Aaron Courville, Chuang Gan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes the Sparse Universal Transformer (SUT), which leverages Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) and a new stick-breaking-based dynamic halting mechanism to reduce UT's computation complexity while retaining its parameter efficiency and generalization ability.\n\n**Abstract:** The Universal Transformer (UT) is a variant of the Transformer that shares parameters across its layers. Empirical evidence shows that UTs have better compositional generalization than Vanilla Transformers (VTs) in formal language tasks. The parameter-sharing also affords it better parameter efficiency than VTs. Despite its many advantages, scaling UT parameters is much more compute and memory intensive than scaling up a VT. This paper proposes the Sparse Universal Transformer (SUT), which leverages Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) and a new stick-breaking-based dynamic halting mechanism to reduce UT's computation complexity while retaining its parameter efficiency and generalization ability. Experiments show that SUT achieves the same performance as strong baseline models while only using half computation and parameters on WMT'14 and strong generalization results on formal language tasks (Logical inference and CFQ). The new halting mechanism also enables around 50\\% reduction in computation during inference with very little performance decrease on formal language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. Segmented Recurrent Transformer: An Efficient Sequence-to-Sequence Model\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Yinghan Long, Sayeed Shafayet Chowdhury, Kaushik Roy*\n\n**TL;DR:** A segmented recurrent transformer that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention that achieves higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have shown dominant performance across a range of domains including language and vision. However, their computational cost grows quadratically with the sequence length, making their usage prohibitive for resource-constrained applications. To counter this, our approach is to divide the whole sequence into segments and apply attention to the individual segments. We propose a segmented recurrent transformer (SRformer) that combines segmented (local) attention with recurrent attention. The loss caused by reducing the attention window length is compensated by aggregating information across segments with recurrent attention. SRformer leverages Recurrent Accumulate-and-Fire (RAF) neurons' inherent memory to update the cumulative product of keys and values. The segmented attention and lightweight RAF neurons ensure the efficiency of the proposed transformer. Such an approach leads to models with sequential processing capability at a lower computation/memory cost. We apply the proposed method to T5 and BART transformers. The modified models are tested on summarization datasets including CNN-dailymail, XSUM, ArXiv, and MediaSUM. Notably, using segmented inputs of varied sizes, the proposed model achieves $6-22\\%$ higher ROUGE1 scores than a segmented transformer and outperforms other recurrent transformer approaches. Furthermore, compared to full attention, the proposed model reduces the computational complexity of cross attention by around $40\\%$.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Training Ultra Long Context Language Model with Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Dhabaleswar K. Panda, Hari Subramoni, Aamir Shafi, Olatunji Ruwase, Masahiro Tanaka, Sam Ade Jacobs, Jinghan Yao*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) with long context capabilities are integral to complex tasks in natural language processing and computational biology, such as text generation and protein sequence analysis. However, training LLMs directly on extremely long contexts demands considerable GPU resources and increased memory, leading to higher costs and greater complexity. Alternative approaches that introduce long context capabilities via downstream finetuning or adaptations impose significant design limitations. In this paper, we propose Fully Pipelined Distributed Transformer (FPDT) for efficiently training long-context LLMs with extreme hardware efficiency. For GPT and Llama models, we achieve a 16x increase in sequence length that can be trained on the same hardware compared to current state-of-the-art solutions. With our dedicated sequence chunk pipeline design, we can now train 8B LLM with 2 million sequence length on only 4 GPUs, while also maintaining over 55% of MFU. Our proposed FPDT is agnostic to existing training techniques and is proven to work efficiently across different LLM models.\n\n**Published:** 2024-08-30\n\n\n\n#### 2. EdgeFormer: A Parameter-Efficient Transformer for On-Device Seq2seq Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Furu Wei, Si-Qing Chen, Tao Ge*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce EdgeFormer -- a parameter-efficient Transformer for on-device seq2seq generation under the strict computation and memory constraints. Compared with the previous parameter-efficient Transformers, EdgeFormer applies two novel principles for cost-effective parameterization, allowing it to perform better given the same parameter budget; moreover, EdgeFormer is further enhanced by layer adaptation innovation that is proposed for improving the network with shared layers. Extensive experiments show EdgeFormer can effectively outperform previous parameter-efficient Transformer baselines and achieve competitive results under both the computation and memory constraints. Given the promising results, we release EdgeLM -- the pretrained version of EdgeFormer, which is the first publicly available pretrained on-device seq2seq model that can be easily fine-tuned for seq2seq tasks with strong results, facilitating on-device seq2seq generation in practice.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-16\n\n\n\n#### 3. Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive computation transformer memory efficiency*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set. Transfer performance is measured across six smaller datasets.\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-18\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on adaptive computation, memory efficiency, and reduced computational overhead, here are some key implementations and strategies derived from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Adaptive Computation Mechanisms\n\n### Adaptive Attention Patterns\n- The **Adaptive Large Chunk Context Attention (ALCCA)** model introduces a tree-based structure to approximate attention computations. This approach combines the benefits of sparse attention with adaptive computation, resulting in more efficient processing of long sequences. It uses spatial partitioning of key vectors and adaptive computation based on query-key distances, which can significantly reduce computational overhead.\n\n### Dynamic Parameter Selection\n- **Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs)** involve learning a network for memory management that focuses on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. This approach allows for dynamic selection of tokens to preserve or discard, optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency. NAMMs can be trained on a small set of problems and transferred to other transformer models, including those with different architectures and input modalities.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\n- **Sparse attention mechanisms** can reduce memory bandwidth requirements and computational overhead. For example, the \"Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\" uses sparse computation to achieve full attention capabilities with lower computational costs. This involves segmenting the input sequence and computing attention only for relevant segments, thus reducing the overall computational load [Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Efficiency Strategies\n\n### Efficient Memory Access\n- **Product Key Memory Integration** enables efficient parameter access with \\(O(\\sqrt{|K|})\\) complexity. This design can significantly increase the memory capacity of the architecture with minimal computational overhead. It can be integrated at different levels of the architecture to optimize memory access patterns[Analysis Note].\n\n### Hierarchical Memory Organization\n- **Memory-Augmented Transformer** architectures encode external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploit fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. This hierarchical organization of memory can maintain the relevance of stored information through dynamic updates, ensuring efficient memory usage[Analysis Note].\n\n### Chunking and Sparse Access Patterns\n- **ALCCA** and similar models use efficient chunking and sparse access patterns to reduce memory usage. By partitioning the input sequence into chunks and computing attention only for relevant chunks, these models can achieve linear memory usage in sequence length.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques\n\n### Memristor-Based Implementations\n- Using **memristor-based in-memory computing** can significantly improve the efficiency of transformer models. This approach leverages memristor devices to perform matrix-matrix multiplication and softmax calculations, resulting in a 10\u00d7 acceleration of transformer self-attention compared to digital counterparts. It also reduces power consumption and latency, making it a viable option for efficient memory access and computation.\n\n### GPU Optimization\n- **Mixed Precision Training** and **GPU-accelerated operations** can reduce memory usage and speed up training. Techniques like using lower precision (e.g., float16) for calculations while maintaining model accuracy, and distributing the training workload across multiple GPUs, can enhance throughput and reduce memory footprint.\n\n## Recursive and Efficient Architectures\n\n### Recursive Transformers\n- **Recursive Transformers** reuse the same set of parameters across multiple layers, significantly reducing the memory footprint and computational requirements. This approach allows for greater depth of analysis with fewer parameters, making it more efficient and scalable. Recursive Transformers can achieve up to 98.5% of the original model\u2019s accuracy using only half the parameters and running more than twice as fast.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more memory-efficient, computationally efficient, and scalable:\n\n- **Adaptive attention mechanisms** like ALCCA and NAMMs can optimize attention patterns and memory usage.\n- **Efficient memory access** techniques such as product key memory integration and hierarchical memory organization can reduce computational overhead.\n- **Hardware optimization** using memristor-based computing and GPU-accelerated operations can further enhance efficiency.\n- **Recursive architectures** can reduce the memory footprint and improve throughput.\n\nThese approaches collectively address the key challenges in improving autoregressive language model design, ensuring better performance, efficiency, and scalability.\n",

In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/39 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nCorrespondence to: Samy Jelassi $<$ sjelassi@fas.harvard.edu $>$.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality. Future research involving vision or speech could further substantiate the robustness of our method. ## E Impact Statement\n\nThis paper presents SPARSEK Attention, whose goal is to address both computational and memory efficiency challenges in long-range Transformer computing.

Specifically, we highlight the potential impacts of SPARSEK as follows:\n\n- Efficient Long-Range Modeling. First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. By prioritizing a subset of key-value pairs, SPARSEK attention effectively reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model performance.\n```\n\n#### 4. An Attention Free Transformer (Avg.

We identify input length thresholds (tipping points) at which efficient Transformer variants become more efficient than vanilla models, using a variety of efficiency metrics (latency, throughput, and memory). To conduct this analysis for speech, we introduce L-HuBERT, a novel local-attention variant of a self-supervised speech model. We observe that these thresholds are (a) much higher than typical dataset sequence lengths and (b) dependent on the metric and modality, showing that choosing the right model depends on modality, task type (long-form vs. typical context) and resource constraints (time vs. memory).

However, their attention mechanism comes with a quadratic complexity in sequence lengths, making the computational overhead prohibitive, especially for long sequences. Attention context can be seen as a random-access memory with each token taking a slot. Under this perspective, the memory size grows linearly with the sequence length, and so does the overhead of reading from it. One way to improve the efficiency is to bound the memory size. We show that disparate approaches can be subsumed into one abstraction, attention with bounded-memory control (ABC), and they vary in their organization of the memory. ABC reveals new, unexplored possibilities. First, it connects several efficient attention variants that would otherwise seem apart. Second, this abstraction gives new insights\u2014an established approach (Wang et al., 2020b) previously thought to not be applicable in causal attention, actually is. Last, we present a new instance of ABC, which draws inspiration from existing ABC approaches, but replaces their heuristic memory-organizing functions with a learned, contextualized one.

Kersting*\n\n**TL;DR:** AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction, and outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Generative transformer models have become increasingly complex, with large numbers of parameters and the ability to process multiple input modalities. Current methods for explaining their predictions are resource-intensive. Most crucially, they require prohibitively large amounts of extra memory, since they rely on backpropagation which allocates almost twice as much GPU memory as the forward pass. This makes it difficult, if not impossible, to use them in production. We present AtMan that provides explanations of generative transformer models at almost no extra cost. Specifically, AtMan is a modality-agnostic perturbation method that manipulates the attention mechanisms of transformers to produce relevance maps for the input with respect to the output prediction. Instead of using backpropagation, AtMan applies a parallelizable token-based search method based on cosine similarity neighborhood in the embedding space. Our exhaustive experiments on text and image-text benchmarks demonstrate that AtMan outperforms current state-of-the-art gradient-based methods on several metrics while being computationally efficient. As such, AtMan is suitable for use in large model inference deployments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5. FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention variants transformer*\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 1361  (*Influential: 136*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Three things everyone should know about Vision Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention variants transformer*\n\n*Herv\u00e9 J\u00e9gou, Jakob Verbeek, Alaaeldin El-Nouby, Matthieu Cord, Hugo Touvron*\n\n**Abstract:** After their initial success in natural language processing, transformer architectures have rapidly gained traction in computer vision, providing state-of-the-art results for tasks such as image classification, detection, segmentation, and video analysis. We offer three insights based on simple and easy to implement variants of vision transformers. (1) The residual layers of vision transformers, which are usually processed sequentially, can to some extent be processed efficiently in parallel without noticeably affecting the accuracy. (2) Fine-tuning the weights of the attention layers is sufficient to adapt vision transformers to a higher resolution and to other classification tasks. This saves compute, reduces the peak memory consumption at fine-tuning time, and allows sharing the majority of weights across tasks. (3) Adding MLP-based patch pre-processing layers improves Bert-like self-supervised training based on patch masking. We evaluate the impact of these design choices using the ImageNet-1k dataset, and confirm our findings on the ImageNet-v2 test set.

Gated Slot Attention for Efficient Linear-Time Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient attention variants transformer*\n\n*Guohong Fu, Peng Zhou, Wei Bi, Bailin Wang, Freda Shi, Bolun Wang, Yiqiao Wang, Leyang Cui, Yue Zhang, Ruijie Zhu, Songlin Yang, Yu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention Transformers and their gated variants, celebrated for enabling parallel training and efficient recurrent inference, still fall short in recall-intensive tasks compared to traditional Transformers and demand significant resources for training from scratch. This paper introduces Gated Slot Attention (GSA), which enhances Attention with Bounded-memory-Control (ABC) by incorporating a gating mechanism inspired by Gated Linear Attention (GLA). Essentially, GSA comprises a two-layer GLA linked via softmax, utilizing context-aware memory reading and adaptive forgetting to improve memory capacity while maintaining compact recurrent state size. This design greatly enhances both training and inference efficiency through GLA's hardware-efficient training algorithm and reduced state size. Additionally, retaining the softmax operation is particularly beneficial in \"finetuning pretrained Transformers to RNNs\" (T2R) settings, reducing the need for extensive training from scratch. Extensive experiments confirm GSA's superior performance in scenarios requiring in-context recall and in T2R settings.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design with a focus on memory-efficient attention variants, here are some specific implementations and strategies that can be considered:\n\n## Sparse Attention Patterns\n\n- **Faster Causal Attention**: This approach extends the FlashAttention mechanism to accommodate various attention sparsity patterns, including key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This method results in no computational complexity overhead and a significant runtime speedup. It is particularly useful for long sequences, as it reduces the memory bandwidth requirements and computational overhead.\n\n## Efficient Memory Access Strategies\n\n- **Product Key Memory**: This strategy involves using product keys to enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search in large memory layers. This design significantly increases the capacity of the architecture with negligible computational overhead. It is beneficial for efficient parameter access and can be integrated with existing models like FastTTTLinear to enhance their memory efficiency.\n\n- **Hierarchical Memory Organization**: Implementing a hierarchical memory organization with dynamic updates can improve information flow and maintain the relevance of stored information. This approach is seen in models like the Recurrent Memory Transformer, which stores and processes both local and global information efficiently.\n\n## Adaptive Computation\n\n- **Dynamic Parameter Selection**: Using learned networks to dynamically select parameters can optimize the computational resources. For example, Neural Attention Memory Models (NAMMs) learn to manage memory efficiently by focusing on the most relevant information for individual layers and attention heads. This approach improves performance and efficiency by reducing the input contexts while maintaining or improving the model's capabilities.\n\n- **Adaptive Attention Patterns**: Adaptive attention patterns based on input characteristics can be highly effective. For instance, the backward attention memory architecture (BAM) uses an initial self-attention layer with a counter-causal mask to introduce an asymmetric relationship between older and newer tokens. This helps in preventing redundancies in the KV cache and improves the model's ability to handle repeated words or sentences.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques\n\n- **Memory-Efficient Implementations**: Techniques such as model pruning, knowledge distillation, and efficient attention mechanisms can be used to optimize memory usage. For example, models like DistilBERT are 40% lighter in memory while retaining 97% of the original model's performance. Efficient attention mechanisms like linear attention or multi-query attention also help in scaling better with sequence length.\n\n- **Optimization for Different Hardware**: Implementing models with hardware-aware optimizations is crucial. For instance, memory-efficient bidirectional transformers use parallel layer execution and omission of biases in QKV projections and LayerNorms, which optimize resource utilization and training stability. These models are designed to reduce training time and memory usage, making them more efficient on various hardware configurations.\n\n## Performance Characteristics and Trade-Offs\n\n- **Complexity Analysis**: Memory-efficient transformers like the ones using sparse attention patterns or hierarchical memory organization generally have lower complexity compared to traditional transformers. For example, models like Informer, Autoformer, and FEDformer have complexities of O(L log L) or O(L), which is more efficient than the O(L^2) complexity of traditional transformers.\n\n- **Trade-Offs**: While these models offer significant improvements in efficiency, they may require careful tuning of hyperparameters to maintain performance. For instance, the maximum number of periods in memory-efficient transformers can impact performance, but setting it to a reasonable value (e.g., 16) can help in maintaining efficiency across different scenarios.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only more memory-efficient but also computationally efficient, scalable, and robust to various input characteristics.\n",

Furthermore, our method can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) with minimal fine-tuning, offering a practical solution for effectively managing long-range dependencies in diverse applications. Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/38 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nThis is illustrated on Fig. 2, bottom left. ## 3 Method\n\nWe develop an efficient CUDA kernel written in Triton (Tillet et al., 2019) that maintains the careful memory management of FlashAttention but can handle a causal structure defined through an arbitrary indexing of the keys and the queries. In the case where this indexing consists of a binary decision to drop or not the head of a query/key, this corresponds to our QK-sparse kernels as described in $\\S$ 3.1. In the case where the indexing corresponds to bucket indices e.g. obtained from hashing, this corresponds to our Hash-sparse kernel described in \u00a7 3.2. Notations. Input tensors for attention as in Vaswani et al. (2017) are of shape $B \\times H \\times T \\times D$, with $B$ being the batch size, $H$ the number of heads, $T$ the sequence length, and $D$ the dimension per head. In the following we take the view of a single head and instead consider a query tensor $\\boldsymbol{Q}$ of shape $T_{Q} \\times D$, and a key $\\boldsymbol{K}$ and value $\\boldsymbol{V}$ tensors of shapes $T_{K V} \\times D$. The algorithms described below will be run in parallel for all elements of the Cartesian product $B \\times H$. We split tensors into blocks: $\\boldsymbol{Q} \\triangleq\\left[\\boldsymbol{Q}_{0}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{Q}_{m}\\right], \\boldsymbol{K} \\triangleq\\left[\\boldsymbol{K}_{0}, \\ldots, \\boldsymbol{K}_{n}\\right]$. We define a tile $\\mathcal{T}_{i, j} \\triangleq \\boldsymbol{Q}_{i} \\boldsymbol{K}_{j}^{\\top}$, which corresponds to the dot products of a subpart of the attention matrix (see Fig. 2). ### 3.1 QK-Sparse Attention\n\nShrinking the attention matrix.

We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification).

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/40 (Score: 0.54)*\n\n```\non pp. 1-4, 12, 16, 19, 29, 30).

Self-Attention through Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes\n\n*From Search Query: hardware kernel optimization sparse attention*\n\n*Yingyi Chen, Qinghua Tao, F. Tonin, J. Suykens*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired.\n\n**Abstract:** While the great capability of Transformers significantly boosts prediction accuracy, it could also yield overconfident predictions and require calibrated uncertainty estimation, which can be commonly tackled by Gaussian processes (GPs). Existing works apply GPs with symmetric kernels under variational inference to the attention kernel; however, omitting the fact that attention kernels are in essence asymmetric. Moreover, the complexity of deriving the GP posteriors remains high for large-scale data. In this work, we propose Kernel-Eigen Pair Sparse Variational Gaussian Processes (KEP-SVGP) for building uncertainty-aware self-attention where the asymmetry of attention kernels is tackled by Kernel SVD (KSVD) and a reduced complexity is acquired. Through KEP-SVGP, i) the SVGP pair induced by the two sets of singular vectors from KSVD w.r.t. the attention kernel fully characterizes the asymmetry; ii) using only a small set of adjoint eigenfunctions from KSVD, the derivation of SVGP posteriors can be based on the inversion of a diagonal matrix containing singular values, contributing to a reduction in time complexity; iii) an evidence lower bound is derived so that variational parameters and network weights can be optimized with it.

R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers and empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs.\n\n**Abstract:** Overparameterized neural networks generalize well but are expensive to train. Ideally, one would like to reduce their computational cost while retaining their generalization benefits. Sparse model training is a simple and promising approach to achieve this, but there remain challenges as existing methods struggle with accuracy loss, slow training runtime, or difficulty in sparsifying all model components. The core problem is that searching for a sparsity mask over a discrete set of sparse matrices is difficult and expensive. To address this, our main insight is to optimize over a continuous superset of sparse matrices with a fixed structure known as products of butterfly matrices. As butterfly matrices are not hardware efficient, we propose simple variants of butterfly (block and flat) to take advantage of modern hardware. Our method (Pixelated Butterfly) uses a simple fixed sparsity pattern based on flat block butterfly and low-rank matrices to sparsify most network layers (e.g., attention, MLP). We empirically validate that Pixelated Butterfly is 3x faster than butterfly and speeds up training to achieve favorable accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On the ImageNet classification and WikiText-103 language modeling tasks, our sparse models train up to 2.5x faster than the dense MLP-Mixer, Vision Transformer, and GPT-2 medium with no drop in accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 3.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores\n\n*From Search Query: hardware kernel optimization sparse attention*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 5.

This is prohibitively large for a variety of applications especially in web-page translation, query-answering etc. Consequently, several approaches have been developed recently to speedup attention computation by enforcing different attention structures such as sparsity, low-rank, approximating attention using kernels. In this work, we view attention computation as that of nearest neighbor retrieval, and use decision tree based hierarchical navigation to reduce the retrieval cost per query token from linear in sequence length to nearly logarithmic. Based on such hierarchical navigation, we design Treeformer which can use one of two efficient attention layers -- TF-Attention and TC-Attention. TF-Attention computes the attention in a fine-grained style, while TC-Attention is a coarse attention layer which also ensures that the gradients are\"dense\". To optimize such challenging discrete layers, we propose a two-level bootstrapped training method. Using extensive experiments on standard NLP benchmarks, especially for long-sequences, we demonstrate that our Treeformer architecture can be almost as accurate as baseline Transformer while using 30x lesser FLOPs in the attention layer. Compared to Linformer, the accuracy can be as much as 12% higher while using similar FLOPs in the attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Spyx: A Library for Just-In-Time Compiled Optimization of Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: hardware kernel optimization sparse attention*\n\n*Thomas Nowotny, Kade M. Heckel*\n\n**Abstract:** As the role of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pivotal in modern society, the efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks have emerged as critical areas of focus. Recent advancements in attention-based large neural architectures have spurred the development of AI accelerators, facilitating the training of extensive, multi-billion parameter models. Despite their effectiveness, these powerful networks often incur high execution costs in production environments. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural processes, offers a promising alternative. By utilizing temporally-sparse computations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer to enhance energy efficiency through a reduced and low-power hardware footprint. However, the training of SNNs can be challenging due to their recurrent nature which cannot as easily leverage the massive parallelism of modern AI accelerators. To facilitate the investigation of SNN architectures and dynamics researchers have sought to bridge Python-based deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow with custom-implemented compute kernels. This paper introduces Spyx, a new and lightweight SNN simulation and optimization library designed in JAX. By pre-staging data in the expansive vRAM of contemporary accelerators and employing extensive JIT compilation, Spyx allows for SNN optimization to be executed as a unified, low-level program on NVIDIA GPUs or Google TPUs. This approach achieves optimal hardware utilization, surpassing the performance of many existing SNN training frameworks while maintaining considerable flexibility.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hardware-specific kernel optimizations for sparse attention, memory access pattern optimization techniques, integration strategies with existing efficient attention implementations, and performance analysis of different kernel implementations, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Hardware-Specific Kernel Optimizations for Sparse Attention\n\n- **SeerAttention** introduces a learnable gate to adaptively identify attention sparsity, which is integrated with a customized FlashAttention kernel.

This approach achieves significant speedup (up to 25.3X) compared to dense FlashAttention-2, with strong downstream performance and optimized memory I/O.\n\n## Memory Access Pattern Optimization Techniques\n\n- **SeerAttention** employs a block-sparse FlashAttention kernel that splits the computation across different warps, each reading sparse block indices generated by the learnable gate. This approach efficiently reduces both I/O and computation overhead by skipping non-activated blocks, optimizing memory access patterns.\n\n- **SparseRefine** and **Block Sparse Attention** also emphasize the importance of sparse high-resolution refinements and various sparse patterns, respectively. These methods optimize memory access by focusing on sparse feature extraction and attention mechanisms that reduce the need for full attention maps, thus improving memory efficiency.\n\n## Integration Strategies with Existing Efficient Attention Implementations\n\n- **SeerAttention** integrates with FlashAttention, a state-of-the-art attention kernel, by customizing it to extract block-wise attention map information without maintaining the full-size attention map. This integration enhances the scalability and efficiency of the training process.\n\n- **Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention** combines sparse and dense attention in hybrid architectures, which is particularly beneficial in practice. This integration allows for high parallelization and optimized memory I/O, making it compatible with existing efficient attention implementations like FlashAttention-2.\n\n## Performance Analysis of Different Kernel Implementations\n\n- **SeerAttention** demonstrates a speedup of up to 2x over the FlashAttention-2 dense baseline at a 32k context size with 90% sparsity. It also shows near-lossless accuracy with 50% sparsity and minimal loss even with 90% sparsity during long-context fine-tuning.\n\n- **Sparsely-Sharded (S2) Attention** achieves a wall-clock speedup of 8.79X, 15.87X, and 25.3X compared to the FlashAttention-2 baseline, with strong downstream performance on-par with full attention and perfect retrieval performance at a 128k context length.\n\n- **Block Sparse Attention** from the MIT HAN Lab also highlights performance improvements through various sparse attention kernels, which can be integrated into existing models to enhance efficiency without significant accuracy loss.\n\nThese findings and references provide detailed insights into how sparse attention mechanisms can be optimized for hardware, how memory access patterns can be improved, and how these optimizations can be integrated with existing efficient attention implementations to enhance the performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

We introduce Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), a novel approach that enables lossless compression of the KV cache, thereby reducing the memory and computational demands during autoregressive generation. LoMA incorporates a specialized training or fine-tuning precedure alongside an autoregressive generation algorithm optimized for the compressed context. Our method compresses the KV cache after every $tc$ generated tokens with a compression ratio of $c$ and a target compressed length $t$, and this process occurs within a single inference pass without dependency on auxiliary models. We engineered an efficient training scheme involving specific inputs, attention masks, and position identifiers to instill this compression capability.

Sparse Attention\n\nIn recent times, the computational burden of long contexts has been effectively alleviated with the introduction of various sparsified attention mechanisms. (Zaheer et al., 2021) integrating random attention, windowed attention, and global attention achieved commendable results. (Zhao et al., 2019), (Gupta et al., 2021) posits that the plethora of irrelevant information within the attention mechanism can be distracting for the model, and thus zeroes out the less significant positions within the attention matrix to focus the model's attention. Subsequently, (Zhang et al., 2023) proposed a method to filter tokens of importance by summing up attention scores. Going a step further, (Ribar et al., 2023) estimated attention scores in the embedding dimension using the top-r values to then select the top- k largest KV pairs. The recently prominent Mistral architecture(Jiang et al., 2023a), employs windowed attention akin to the receptive fields of CNNs(O'Shea \\& Nash, 2015), theoretically enabling the effortless handling of text sequences up to the length of $32 \\times 4096$.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 40/41 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nHowever, our method is not dependent on the input modality.

First and foremost, the SPARSEK attention mechanism significantly reduces computational requirements compared to traditional self-attention mechanisms. By prioritizing a subset of key-value pairs, SPARSEK attention effectively reduces the memory footprint without sacrificing model performance.\n```\n\n#### 4. Sparse Sinkhorn Attention (Avg.

Via extensive experiments on algorithmic seq2seq sorting, language modeling, pixel-wise image generation, document classification and natural language inference, we demonstrate that our memory efficient Sinkhorn Attention method is competitive with vanilla attention and consistently outperforms recently proposed efficient Transformer models such as Sparse Transformers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/23 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pp. 2048-2057, 2015.

Combiner: Full Attention Transformer with Sparse Computation Cost\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention product key memory*\n\n*Hongyu Ren, H. Dai, Zihang Dai, Mengjiao Yang, J. Leskovec, D. Schuurmans, Bo Dai*\n\n**TL;DR:** Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers provide a class of expressive architectures that are extremely effective for sequence modeling. However, the key limitation of transformers is their quadratic memory and time complexity $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ with respect to the sequence length in attention layers, which restricts application in extremely long sequences. Most existing approaches leverage sparsity or low-rank assumptions in the attention matrix to reduce cost, but sacrifice expressiveness. Instead, we propose Combiner, which provides full attention capability in each attention head while maintaining low computation and memory complexity. The key idea is to treat the self-attention mechanism as a conditional expectation over embeddings at each location, and approximate the conditional distribution with a structured factorization. Each location can attend to all other locations, either via direct attention, or through indirect attention to abstractions, which are again conditional expectations of embeddings from corresponding local regions. We show that most sparse attention patterns used in existing sparse transformers are able to inspire the design of such factorization for full attention, resulting in the same sub-quadratic cost ($\\mathcal{O}(L\\log(L))$ or $\\mathcal{O}(L\\sqrt{L})$). Combiner is a drop-in replacement for attention layers in existing transformers and can be easily implemented in common frameworks. An experimental evaluation on both autoregressive and bidirectional sequence tasks demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach, yielding state-of-the-art results on several image and text modeling tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 2.

Like its dense counterpart, the sparse modern Hopfield model equips a memory-retrieval dynamics whose one-step approximation corresponds to the sparse attention mechanism. Theoretically, our key contribution is a principled derivation of a closed-form sparse Hopfield energy using the convex conjugate of the sparse entropic regularizer. Building upon this, we derive the sparse memory retrieval dynamics from the sparse energy function and show its one-step approximation is equivalent to the sparse-structured attention. Importantly, we provide a sparsity-dependent memory retrieval error bound which is provably tighter than its dense analog. The conditions for the benefits of sparsity to arise are therefore identified and discussed. In addition, we show that the sparse modern Hopfield model maintains the robust theoretical properties of its dense counterpart, including rapid fixed point convergence and exponential memory capacity. Empirically, we use both synthetic and real-world datasets to demonstrate that the sparse Hopfield model outperforms its dense counterpart in many situations.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 3.

BiSHop handles the two major challenges of deep tabular learning: non-rotationally invariant data structure and feature sparsity in tabular data. Our key motivation comes from the recent established connection between associative memory and attention mechanisms. Consequently, BiSHop uses a dual-component approach, sequentially processing data both column-wise and row-wise through two interconnected directional learning modules. Computationally, these modules house layers of generalized sparse modern Hopfield layers, a sparse extension of the modern Hopfield model with adaptable sparsity. Methodologically, BiSHop facilitates multi-scale representation learning, capturing both intra-feature and inter-feature interactions, with adaptive sparsity at each scale. Empirically, through experiments on diverse real-world datasets, we demonstrate that BiSHop surpasses current SOTA methods with significantly less HPO runs, marking it a robust solution for deep tabular learning.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

These include the classical Hopfield networks (HNs), sparse distributed memories (SDMs), and more recently the modern continuous Hopfield networks (MCHNs), which possess close links with self-attention in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a general framework for understanding the operation of such memory networks as a sequence of three operations: similarity, separation, and projection. We derive all these memory models as instances of our general framework with differing similarity and separation functions. We extend the mathematical framework of Krotov & Hopfield (2020) to express general associative memory models using neural network dynamics with local computation, and derive a general energy function that is a Lyapunov function of the dynamics. Finally, using our framework, we empirically investigate the capacity of using different similarity functions for these associative memory models, beyond the dot product similarity measure, and demonstrate empirically that Euclidean or Manhattan distance similarity metrics perform substantially better in practice on many tasks, enabling a more robust retrieval and higher memory capacity than existing models.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention product key memory*\n\n*SHIYANG LI, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** First, convolutional self-attention is proposed by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism, and LogSparse Transformer is proposed, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$ memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1182  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n### 1 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Tackling fluffy clouds: field boundaries detection using time series of S2 and/or S1 imagery\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention product key memory*\n\n*John Taylor, Andrew Toovey, Chris Herrmann, Kathryn Batchelor, Jonathan Richetti, Ondrej Hlinka, Rodrigo Ibata, Peter Caccetta, Amy Parker, Roger Lawes, Dave Henry, Gonzalo Mata, Jeff Wang, Zheng-Shu Zhou, Foivos I. Diakogiannis*\n\n**Abstract:** Accurate field boundary delineation is a critical challenge in digital agriculture, impacting everything from crop monitoring to resource management. Existing methods often struggle with noise and fail to generalize across varied landscapes, particularly when dealing with cloud cover in optical remote sensing. In response, this study presents a new approach that leverages time series data from Sentinel-2 (S2) and Sentinel-1 (S1) imagery to improve performance under diverse cloud conditions, without the need for manual cloud filtering. We introduce a 3D Vision Transformer architecture specifically designed for satellite image time series, incorporating a memory-efficient attention mechanism. Two models are proposed: PTAViT3D, which handles either S2 or S1 data independently, and PTAViT3D-CA, which fuses both datasets to enhance accuracy. Both models are evaluated under sparse and dense cloud coverage by exploiting spatio-temporal correlations. Our results demonstrate that the models can effectively delineate field boundaries, even with partial (S2 or S2 and S1 data fusion) or dense cloud cover (S1), with the S1-based model providing performance comparable to S2 imagery in terms of spatial resolution. A key strength of this approach lies in its capacity to directly process cloud-contaminated imagery by leveraging spatio-temporal correlations in a memory-efficient manner. This methodology, used in the ePaddocks product to map Australia's national field boundaries, offers a robust, scalable solution adaptable to varying agricultural environments, delivering precision and reliability where existing methods falter.

This approach, defined as the top-r nearest neighbors Softmax attention, focuses on computing attention only based on the top-r entries, significantly reducing computational time without introducing significant approximation errors.\n\n## Product Key Memory Implementations in Language Models\n\n- While the provided sources do not directly discuss \"product key memory\" implementations, the concept of using sparse retrieval and memory-augmented architectures is relevant. For example, the idea of using a scoring network and a differentiable top-k mask operator, as mentioned in the context of sparse attention, can be extended to product key memory. The \"Attention-Gate (AG)\" mechanism in \"In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate\" dynamically manages the KV-Cache, which could be seen as a form of memory-efficient attention variant, although it does not specifically use product keys.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Attention Architectures\n\n- The blog post \"Accelerate Inference of Sparse Transformer Models with OpenVINO\" highlights the importance of hardware-aware optimizations for sparse transformer models. It discusses how fine-grained pruning and quantization can be used to reduce the model footprint and improve inference performance on specific hardware, such as 4th Gen Intel\u00ae Xeon\u00ae Scalable Processors. This approach shows significant performance improvements, especially for tasks like Question Answering and Sequence Classification, where sequence lengths are not excessively long.\n\n## Memory-Computation Trade-offs in Attention Mechanisms\n\n- The \"HSR-Enhanced Sparse Attention Acceleration\" paper provides a detailed analysis of the trade-offs between computational complexity and memory usage. By focusing only on the top-r entries in the attention matrix, the method reduces the computational time from \\(O(mn)\\) to \\(O(mn^{4/5})\\), which is a significant improvement, especially for large \\(n\\). This approach demonstrates that omitting less significant entries is a justifiable compromise, leading to negligible approximation errors under mild assumptions about the attention score distribution.\n\n- The \"In-context KV-Cache Eviction for LLMs via Attention-Gate\" paper discusses the memory-computation trade-offs in the context of KV-Cache management. It introduces a dynamic eviction mechanism that balances the need to retain important tokens with the need to reduce computational complexity, highlighting the trade-offs between memory efficiency and model capacity.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- For hardware-aware implementations, the use of specialized frameworks and libraries like OpenVINO, as discussed in the blog post, is crucial. These frameworks provide tools for optimizing and deploying sparse models, which can significantly improve real-world performance.\n\n- The integration of sparse attention mechanisms with product key memory and other memory-efficient architectures requires careful consideration of the model's expressiveness and computational complexity. The novel combination of these techniques, as proposed, offers potential innovations but must be evaluated against existing efficient attention methods and memory-augmented architectures.\n\nBy focusing on these aspects, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and hardware-aware autoregressive language models that leverage sparse attention and product key memory effectively.\n",

The self-attention allows to combine information from all sequence elements into context-aware representations. However, global and local information has to be stored mostly in the same element-wise representations. Moreover, the length of an input sequence is limited by quadratic computational complexity of self-attention. In this work, we propose and study a memory-augmented segment-level recurrent Transformer (RMT). Memory allows to store and process local and global information as well as to pass information between segments of the long sequence with the help of recurrence. We implement a memory mechanism with no changes to Transformer model by adding special memory tokens to the input or output sequence. Then the model is trained to control both memory operations and sequence representations processing. Results of experiments show that RMT performs on par with the Transformer-XL on language modeling for smaller memory sizes and outperforms it for tasks that require longer sequence processing. We show that adding memory tokens to Tr-XL is able to improve its performance. This makes Recurrent Memory Transformer a promising architecture for applications that require learning of long-term dependencies and general purpose in memory processing, such as algorithmic tasks and reasoning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/29 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[^0]The recent rise of Transformer models also resulted in introduction of a number of new memory architectures. Transformer-XL (Dai et al. 2019) introduces a segment-level recurrence at the level of hidden representations. These representations of a sequence are computed and stored in the cache to be reused as an extended context for the next segment. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al. 2019) adds the second layer of memory to Transformer-XL. This memory compresses and stores information from the cache. $\\infty$-former (Martins et al., 2021) utilizes continuous-space attention and represents input sequence as a continuous signal to make long-term memory unbounded. Memory Layers (Lample et al, 2019) model has a product key memory layer instead of a feed-forward layer within Transformer block to increase model capacity.\n```\n\n#### 2.

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 7/26 (Score: 0.90)*\n\n```\nIn $A C L, 2019$.

Score: 0.82)\n\n*Nikita Kitaev, Lukasz Kaiser, Anselm Levskaya*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2020)\t**Cited by** 1881  (*Influential: 222*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work replaces dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing and uses reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of several times, making the model much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Transformer models routinely achieve state-of-the-art results on a number of tasks but training these models can be prohibitively costly, especially on long sequences. We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/19 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\n2017) has been used widely in natural language tasks and further extended to model diverse data such as music scores (Huang et al., 2018), and images (Parmar et al., 2018; Ramachandran et al., 2019). Most notably, this model class has been applied successfully in the self-supervised training of extremely large language models (Devlin et al., 2018, Radford et al. 2019). Given the enormous computational requirements of state of the art sequence models, there has been increasing interest in finding methods to reduce the memory footprint and computational requirements of Transformer models. In addition to standard methods such as precision reduction and gradient checkpointing (Sohoni et al., 2019), more efficient versions of the Transformer model's self-attention mechanism (Sukhbaatar et al. 2019a b) have also recently been explored. In particular, leveraging sparsity in the attention layers has proved fruitful. OpenAI introduced the sparse Transformer (Child et al. 2019) which exploits a factorized sparse representation of attention. Using product-key attention to increase the key space has also been used to reduce memory requirements in the feed-forward layers with no loss in performance (Lample et al, 2019). Locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) has, to our knowledge, not been directly applied to Transformer attention layers before. But previous work using external memory with neural networks has dealt with memories of large sizes. The original implementation of memory networks (Weston et al., 2014) and later work on scaling it (Bordes et al., 2015, Chandar et al., 2016) used memory with size in the millions. The cost of doing so is that the memory must be fixed prior to training. Moreover, since during the beginning of training the model is unlikely to query the memory correctly, strong supervision is used to encourage the model to query memory locations that are useful. These hints are either given as additional supervising information by the task or determined heuristically as in Hill et al. (2015). The requirement that the memory be fixed before has been removed in Santoro et al. (2016) at the cost of memory size and later alleviated by Rae et al. (2016). The last paper considered memory lookups with approximate nearest neighbors including both LSH and random kd-trees, but only for lookups in external memory.\n```\n\n#### 4. Large Memory Layers with Product Keys (Avg. Score: 0.74)\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2019)\t**Cited by** 113  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/21 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nUnfortunately, the fast access to memories rely on an approximate external indexing structure [32] that has to be re-learned periodically. Our work solves this issue by fully incorporating the key selection mechanism as a network component. The transformer network [44] is the current workhorse of Natural Language Processing (NLP): it is employed ubiquitously across a large variety of tasks. Transformers are built by stacking blocks composed of self-attention layers followed by fully connected layers (dubbed FFN), as shown in Figure 3 The components of the memory layer bear similarities to the query, key and value networks used in self-attention layers with two notable differences: the keys and values do not correspond to input tokens but are free embedding vectors, and the number of values (memory size) is very large. ## 3 Learnable product key memories\n\nWe consider the design of a function $m: \\mathbb{R}^{d} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{n}$, that will act as a layer in a neural network. The purpose of $m$ is to offer a large capacity within a neural network. ### 3.1 Memory design\n\nHigh-level structure. The overall structure of our memory is illustrated by Figures 1 and 2 . The memory is composed of three components: a query network, a key selection module containing two sets of sub-keys, and a value lookup table. It first computes a query that is compared to the set of product keys. For each product key, it computes a score and selects the $k$ product keys with the highest scores. The scores are then used to produce an output $m(x)$ via a weighted sum over the values associated with the selected keys. All the parameters of the memory are trainable, yet only $k$ memory slots are updated for each input. The sparse selection and parameter update make both training and inference very efficient. Query generation: pre-processing network. The function $q: x \\mapsto q(x) \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{q}}$, referred to as the query network, maps the $d$-dimensional input to a latent space of dimensionality $d_{\\mathrm{q}}$. Typically, $q$ is a linear mapping or a multi-layer perceptron that reduces the dimensionality from $d$ to $d_{\\mathrm{q}}=$ 512. As keys are randomly initialized, they occupy the space relatively uniformly. Adding a batch normalization layer on the top of the query network helps increasing key coverage during training. This insight is confirmed by our ablation experiments in Section 4.5\n\nStandard key assignment and weighting. Let $q(x)$ be a query and $\\mathcal{T}_{k}$ denote the top-k operator ${ }^{4}$ Given a set of keys $\\mathcal{K}=\\left\\{k_{1}, \\ldots, k_{|\\mathcal{K}|}\\right\\}$ composed of $|\\mathcal{K}| d_{d_{q}}$-dimensional vectors, and an input $x$,\n\n[^1]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_cfa6caed5f8792f4a32fg-04.jpg?height=419&width=1271&top_left_y=235&top_left_x=425)\n\nFigure 2: Illustration of the product keys. We define two discrete subsets of keys (sub-key set 1 and sub-key set 2). They induce a much larger set of keys, which are never made explicit (product keys). Given a query, we split it into two sub-queries ( $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ ). Selecting the $k$ closest keys ( $k=2$ in the figure) in each subset implicitly selects $k \\times k$ keys. The $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query are guaranteed to belong to this subset, on which the search can be done efficiently. we select the top $k$ keys maximizing the inner product with the query $q(x)$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\mathcal{I} & =\\mathcal{T}_{k}\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Get k nearest neighbors } \\\\\nw & =\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\left(q(x)^{T} k_{i}\\right)_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}}\\right) & & \\text { \\# Normalize top-k scores } \\\\\nm(x) & =\\sum_{i \\in \\mathcal{I}} w_{i} v_{i} & & \\text { \\# Aggregate selected values }\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHere $\\mathcal{I}$ denotes the indices of the $k$ most similar keys (where the similarity measure is the inner product), and $w$ is the vector that represents the normalized scores associated with the selected keys.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 4/21 (Score: 0.67)*\n\n```\nThe output is the sparse weighted sum over the memories associated with the selected keys. For a large number of keys $|\\mathcal{K}|$, the key selection procedure becomes too expensive in practice. Our product key method is exact and makes this search process very fast. Figure 11, we define keys as the concatenation of two sub-keys, in the spirit of product quantization [21]. As shown in more details in Figure 2, this structure implicitly defines a very large set of keys, each being associated with a value memory slot. The set of value vectors introduces the bulk of the parameters, as it scales quadratically with the number of sub-keys. Despite the large number of memory slots, finding the exact closest keys to the input is very efficient, typically requiring $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{|\\mathcal{K}|})$ vector comparisons, where $|\\mathcal{K}|$ is the total number of memory slots. All the memory parameters are trainable, yet only a handful of memory slots are updated for each input at training time. Sparsity of key selection and parameter updates make both training and inference very efficient. Our layer allows us to tackle problems where current architectures underfit given the vast amount of available data, or when they are too slow to work in practice. We thus focus on the language modeling task, integrating our memory within the popular transformer architecture [44]. This choice is motivated by the success of BERT [11] and GPT-2 [36], which demonstrated that increasing the capacity of large models directly translates to large improvements in language modeling, which in turn translates to better performance in both language understanding tasks [11, 46] and text generation [36]. Overall, our paper makes the following contributions:\n\n- We introduce a new layer that provides a large capacity to a neural network for only a slight computational overhead both at train and test time. - Our fast indexing strategy offers exact nearest neighbor search by construction, and avoids the pitfall of relying on an indexing structure that needs to be re-learned during training. - We demonstrate our method within a large state-of-the-art transformer, composed of 24 layers of dimension 1600. Our method with 1 memory and 12 layers outperforms a 24 layer transformer while being twice faster at inference time. We show that adding more memory layers to transformers of various complexities provides systematic and significant improvements on our target task. ## 2 Related work\n\nDifferent approaches have been proposed to increase the capacity of neural networks without increasing too much the computational complexity. For instance, conditional computation models aim at routing inputs into very large neural networks such that only a subset of connections and/or layers are used to process each input. Different methods have been developed like large mixture of experts [40], gating techniques [3, 12, 6] or even reinforcement learning-based approaches [10]. Another line of research is the development of memory augmented neural networks. For instance, memory-based neural layers [47, 42] are an efficient way to represent variable length inputs for complex problems such as question answering [48]. Such memories can also operate in feature space and have various reading and writing mechanisms [23, 17]. Unfortunately, these approaches scale linearly with the size of the memory which is prohibitive for very large memories. Neural cache models [15] suffer from the same scaling issues, which are circumvented by adopting approximate lookup techniques at test time [14]. Discretization techniques have been intensively studied for compressing network weights [8, 38] and/or activations [7, 38] or to accelerate inference. For instance, Gerald et al. [13] propose to map an input to a low-dimensional binary code, each code being associated with one category, thus reducing the complexity of inference by avoiding the use of a final large linear layer. Another model is proposed in [45], where the authors develop a fast locality-sensitive hashing technique to approximate the dot product between large matrices and vectors in neural networks. However, exploiting binary codes or approximate techniques at training time raises several challenges in terms of optimization, because approximate indexes are not accurate in high-dimensional spaces. In our paper, we borrow some ideas from product quantization (PQ) [21]. This is an approximate search technique that maps database vectors into compact codes. However, our goal is different: we do not build an approximate index, but rather we exploit the idea to represent a large set of key vectors by a drastically smaller number of vectors, that we update by regular back-propagation. As discussed later, the selection of the closest keys is exact and inherits from the fast neighbor search of PQ. Our model is also related to sparsity models which have been mainly studied in the unsupervised learning setting [34, 24]. For instance, the k-sparse autoencoder [30] only keeps the k largest values in the latent representation of an auto-encoder, similar to our memory layer but without the product keys component. In winner take all autoencoders [31], sparsity is induced by using mini-batch statistics, while in the sparse access memory [37] reports some speed-up by both thresholding the memory to a sparse subset, and by using efficient data structures for content-based read operations.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: product key memory transformer hardware optimization\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. An Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer for Knowledge-Intensive NLP Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer hardware optimization*\n\n*Yuxiang Wu, Yu Zhao, Baotian Hu, Pasquale Minervini, Pontus Stenetorp, Sebastian Riedel*\n\n**TL;DR:** The Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) is proposed \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Abstract:** Access to external knowledge is essential for many natural language processing tasks, such as question answering and dialogue. Existing methods often rely on a parametric model that stores knowledge in its parameters, or use a retrieval-augmented model that has access to an external knowledge source. Parametric and retrieval-augmented models have complementary strengths in terms of computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. To combine the strength of both approaches, we propose the Efficient Memory-Augmented Transformer (EMAT) \u2013 it encodes external knowledge into a key-value memory and exploits the fast maximum inner product search for memory querying. We also introduce pre-training tasks that allow EMAT to encode informative key-value representations, and to learn an implicit strategy to integrate multiple memory slots into the transformer. Experiments on various knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering and dialogue datasets show that, simply augmenting parametric models (T5-base) using our method produces more accurate results (e.g., 25.8 \u2192 44.3 EM on NQ) while retaining a high throughput (e.g., 1000 queries/s on NQ). Compared to retrieval-augmented models, EMAT runs substantially faster across the board and produces more accurate results on WoW and ELI5.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 2. Enhancing the Locality and Breaking the Memory Bottleneck of Transformer on Time Series Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer hardware optimization*\n\n*SHIYANG LI, Xiaoyong Jin, Yao Xuan, Xiyou Zhou, Wenhu Chen, Yu-Xiang Wang, Xifeng Yan*\n\n**TL;DR:** First, convolutional self-attention is proposed by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism, and LogSparse Transformer is proposed, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Time series forecasting is an important problem across many domains, including predictions of solar plant energy output, electricity consumption, and traffic jam situation. In this paper, we propose to tackle such forecasting problem with Transformer [1]. Although impressed by its performance in our preliminary study, we found its two major weaknesses: (1) locality-agnostics: the point-wise dot-product self-attention in canonical Transformer architecture is insensitive to local context, which can make the model prone to anomalies in time series; (2) memory bottleneck: space complexity of canonical Transformer grows quadratically with sequence length $L$, making directly modeling long time series infeasible. In order to solve these two issues, we first propose convolutional self-attention by producing queries and keys with causal convolution so that local context can be better incorporated into attention mechanism. Then, we propose LogSparse Transformer with only $O(L(\\log L)^{2})$ memory cost, improving forecasting accuracy for time series with fine granularity and strong long-term dependencies under constrained memory budget. Our experiments on both synthetic data and real-world datasets show that it compares favorably to the state-of-the-art.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 1182  (*Influential: 132*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer hardware optimization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4.

Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 46  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 5. Large Memory Layers with Product Keys\n\n*From Search Query: product key memory transformer hardware optimization*\n\n*Guillaume Lample, Alexandre Sablayrolles, Marc'Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, H. J\u00e9gou*\n\n**TL;DR:** A structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper introduces a structured memory which can be easily integrated into a neural network. The memory is very large by design and significantly increases the capacity of the architecture, by up to a billion parameters with a negligible computational overhead. Its design and access pattern is based on product keys, which enable fast and exact nearest neighbor search. The ability to increase the number of parameters while keeping the same computational budget lets the overall system strike a better trade-off between prediction accuracy and computation efficiency both at training and test time. This memory layer allows us to tackle very large scale language modeling tasks. In our experiments we consider a dataset with up to 30 billion words, and we plug our memory layer in a state-of-the-art transformer-based architecture. In particular, we found that a memory augmented model with only 12 layers outperforms a baseline transformer model with 24 layers, while being twice faster at inference time. We release our code for reproducibility purposes.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 118  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researchers improve the autoregressive language model design, focusing on the specified areas, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Product Key Memory Architectures and Implementations in Transformers\n\n- The concept of product key memory is closely related to efficient attention mechanisms. Papers like \"Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention\" suggest that key vectors can be represented in a lower-dimensional space, which can be exploited to reduce memory usage. However, specific implementations of product key memory in the context of sparse attention are still underexplored.\n- The use of memory registers in Memory-Augmented Transformers (Memformers) is another relevant area. Memformers store intermediate attention values across layers, enabling more complex computations and potentially more efficient memory usage. This architecture could be adapted to optimize product key memory.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Optimizations for Attention Mechanisms\n\n- Hardware-aware optimization is crucial for improving the performance of transformer models. This involves tailoring the models to run efficiently on specific hardware platforms, considering factors like precision, memory usage, and computation requirements. For example, using memristor-based in-memory computing can significantly accelerate transformer self-attention mechanisms, reducing latency and power consumption.\n- Techniques such as sparsity and cache eviction are also hardware-specific optimizations. Methods like FastGen and Sparse Sharding Attention strategically skip certain calculations and retrieval sequencing to reduce memory usage during inference, which is often memory-bound.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Transformer Designs\n\n- Memory-efficient bidirectional transformers are a significant advancement. These models use parallel layer execution, omission of biases, and sharding techniques to manage large memory requirements. For instance, models like the one described in \"Memory-Efficient Bidirectional Transformers\" reduce training time and memory usage by employing parallel layers and sharding of activations.\n- Other designs, such as those using sparse attention mechanisms, also aim to reduce memory footprint. For example, \"Sparser is Faster and Less is More\" and \"Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention\" propose methods to select a constant number of KV pairs, reducing memory usage during generation.\n\n## Empirical Performance Comparisons of Different Memory Architectures in Transformers\n\n- Empirical comparisons are essential to evaluate the effectiveness of different memory architectures. For instance, the comparison between traditional transformers and memory-efficient bidirectional transformers shows that the latter can reduce time and memory costs, especially with increased input sizes.\n- The \"Sparse Sharding Attention\" method, when compared to Flash Attention 2, demonstrates reduced compute and memory usage while maintaining accuracy, particularly as the context window size increases.\n- The memristor-based hardware accelerator for transformer self-attention also provides empirical results, showing a 10\u00d7 acceleration compared to digital counterparts, along with improvements in latency and power consumption.\n\nIn summary, the key areas to focus on include:\n\n- **Memory-Augmented Transformers**: Utilizing memory registers to store intermediate attention values, which can be adapted for product key memory optimizations.\n- **Hardware-Aware Optimizations**: Tailoring models for specific hardware, using techniques like memristor-based computing, sparsity, and cache eviction.\n- **Memory-Efficient Architectures**: Employing parallel layer execution, omission of biases, and sharding techniques to reduce memory usage.\n- **Empirical Comparisons**: Evaluating the performance of different memory architectures to identify the most efficient approaches.\n",

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2.

Unfortunately, one of their core limitations is the quadratic dependency (mainly in terms of memory) on the sequence length due to their full attention mechanism. To remedy this, we propose, BigBird, a sparse attention mechanism that reduces this quadratic dependency to linear. We show that BigBird is a universal approximator of sequence functions and is Turing complete, thereby preserving these properties of the quadratic, full attention model. Along the way, our theoretical analysis reveals some of the benefits of having $O(1)$ global tokens (such as CLS), that attend to the entire sequence as part of the sparse attention mechanism. The proposed sparse attention can handle sequences of length up to 8x of what was previously possible using similar hardware. As a consequence of the capability to handle longer context, BigBird drastically improves performance on various NLP tasks such as question answering and summarization. We also propose novel applications to genomics data.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/94 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWe provide implementation details in App. D. ## 3 Theoretical Results about Sparse Attention Mechanism\n\nIn this section, we will show that that sparse attention mechanisms are as powerful and expressive as full-attention mechanisms in two respects.

Existing methods typically employ a uniform sparse attention mask, applying the same sparse pattern across different attention heads and input lengths. However, this uniform approach fails to capture the diverse attention patterns inherent in LLMs, ignoring their distinct accuracy-latency trade-offs. To address this challenge, we propose the Mixture of Attention (MoA), which automatically tailors distinct sparse attention configurations to different heads and layers. MoA constructs and navigates a search space of various attention patterns and their scaling rules relative to input sequence lengths. It profiles the model, evaluates potential configurations, and pinpoints the optimal sparse attention compression plan. MoA adapts to varying input sizes, revealing that some attention heads expand their focus to accommodate longer sequences, while other heads consistently concentrate on fixed-length local contexts. Experiments show that MoA increases the effective context length by $3.9\\times$ with the same average attention span, boosting retrieval accuracy by $1.5-7.1\\times$ over the uniform-attention baseline across Vicuna-7B, Vicuna-13B, and Llama3-8B models. Moreover, MoA narrows the capability gaps between sparse and dense models, reducing the maximum relative performance drop from $9\\%-36\\%$ to within $5\\%$ across two long-context understanding benchmarks. MoA achieves a $1.2-1.4\\times$ GPU memory reduction and boosts decode throughput by $5.5-6.7 \\times$ for 7B and 13B dense models on a single GPU, with minimal impact on performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/38 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nAssociation for Computing Machinery.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 24/32 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\n[RSVG20b] Aurko Roy, M.

Fast Attention Over Long Sequences With Dynamic Sparse Flash Attention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Matteo Pagliardini, Daniele Paliotta, Martin Jaggi, F. Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention, leading to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based language models have found many diverse applications requiring them to process sequences of increasing length. For these applications, the causal self-attention\u2014which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementation concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attention often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by 2 . 0 \u00d7 and 3 . 3 \u00d7 for sequences of respectively 8 k and 16 k tokens.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

We present VARS, Visual Attention from Recurrent Sparse reconstruction, a new attention formulation built on two prominent features of the human visual attention mechanism: recurrency and sparsity. Related features are grouped together via recurrent connections between neurons, with salient objects emerging via sparse regularization. VARS adopts an attractor network with recurrent connections that converges toward a stable pattern over time. Network layers are represented as ordinary differential equations (ODEs), formulating attention as a recurrent attractor network that equivalently optimizes the sparse reconstruction of input using a dictionary of\"templates\"encoding underlying patterns of data. We show that self-attention is a special case of VARS with a single-step optimization and no sparsity constraint. VARS can be readily used as a replacement for self-attention in popular vision transformers, consistently improving their robustness across various benchmarks.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4.

The quality of the final representation can be measured by a unified objective function called sparse rate reduction. From this perspective, popular deep networks such as transformers can be naturally viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this objective incrementally. Particularly, we show that the standard transformer block can be derived from alternating optimization on complementary parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator can be viewed as a gradient descent step to compress the token sets by minimizing their lossy coding rate, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron can be viewed as attempting to sparsify the representation of the tokens. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures which are mathematically fully interpretable. Despite their simplicity, experiments show that these networks indeed learn to optimize the designed objective: they compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world vision datasets such as ImageNet, and achieve performance very close to thoroughly engineered transformers such as ViT.

Where to Pay Attention in Sparse Training for Feature Selection?\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Ghada Sokar, Zahra Atashgahi, Mykola Pechenizkiy, D. Mocanu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new sparse training algorithm that optimizes a model's sparse topology during training to pay attention to informative features quickly and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of selecting informative features while reducing training iterations and computational costs substantially.\n\n**Abstract:** A new line of research for feature selection based on neural networks has recently emerged. Despite its superiority to classical methods, it requires many training iterations to converge and detect informative features. The computational time becomes prohibitively long for datasets with a large number of samples or a very high dimensional feature space. In this paper, we present a new efficient unsupervised method for feature selection based on sparse autoencoders. In particular, we propose a new sparse training algorithm that optimizes a model's sparse topology during training to pay attention to informative features quickly. The attention-based adaptation of the sparse topology enables fast detection of informative features after a few training iterations. We performed extensive experiments on 10 datasets of different types, including image, speech, text, artificial, and biological. They cover a wide range of characteristics, such as low and high-dimensional feature spaces, and few and large training samples. Our proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of selecting informative features while reducing training iterations and computational costs substantially. Moreover, the experiments show the robustness of our method in extremely noisy environments.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. FlashMask: Efficient and Rich Mask Extension of FlashAttention\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Haifeng Wang, dianhai yu, Jiang Bian, Zeyu Chen, Lujing Zheng, Jiabin Yang, Siming Wu, Xiyuan Xiao, Jinle Zeng, Guoxia Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** The computational and memory demands of vanilla attention scale quadratically with the sequence length $N$, posing significant challenges for processing long sequences in Transformer models. FlashAttention alleviates these challenges by eliminating the $O(N^2)$ memory dependency and reducing attention latency through IO-aware memory optimizations. However, its native support for certain attention mask types is limited, and it does not inherently accommodate more complex masking requirements. Previous approaches resort to using dense masks with $O(N^2)$ memory complexity, leading to inefficiencies. In this paper, we propose FlashMask, an extension of FlashAttention that introduces a column-wise sparse representation of attention masks. This approach efficiently represents a wide range of mask types and facilitates the development of optimized kernel implementations. By adopting this novel representation, FlashMask achieves linear memory complexity $O(N)$, suitable for modeling long-context sequences. Moreover, this representation enables kernel optimizations that eliminate unnecessary computations by leveraging sparsity in the attention mask, without sacrificing computational accuracy, resulting in higher computational efficiency. We evaluate FlashMask's performance in fine-tuning and alignment training of LLMs such as SFT, LoRA, DPO, and RM. FlashMask achieves significant throughput improvements, with end-to-end speedups ranging from 1.65x to 3.22x compared to existing FlashAttention dense method. Additionally, our kernel-level comparisons demonstrate that FlashMask surpasses the latest counterpart, FlexAttention, by 12.1% to 60.7% in terms of kernel TFLOPs/s, achieving 37.8% to 62.3% of the theoretical maximum FLOPs/s on the A100 GPU. The code is open-sourced on PaddlePaddle and integrated into PaddleNLP, supporting models with over 100 billion parameters for contexts up to 128K tokens.\n\n**Published:** 2024-10-02\n\n\n\n#### 2. White-Box Transformers via Sparse Rate Reduction: Compression Is All There Is?\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Yi Ma, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Yuexiang Zhai, Hao Bai, Shengbang Tong, Ziyang Wu, Tianzhe Chu, Druv Pai, Sam Buchanan, Yaodong Yu*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we contend that a natural objective of representation learning is to compress and transform the distribution of the data, say sets of tokens, towards a low-dimensional Gaussian mixture supported on incoherent subspaces. The goodness of such a representation can be evaluated by a principled measure, called sparse rate reduction, that simultaneously maximizes the intrinsic information gain and extrinsic sparsity of the learned representation. From this perspective, popular deep network architectures, including transformers, can be viewed as realizing iterative schemes to optimize this measure. Particularly, we derive a transformer block from alternating optimization on parts of this objective: the multi-head self-attention operator compresses the representation by implementing an approximate gradient descent step on the coding rate of the features, and the subsequent multi-layer perceptron sparsifies the features. This leads to a family of white-box transformer-like deep network architectures, named CRATE, which are mathematically fully interpretable. We show, by way of a novel connection between denoising and compression, that the inverse to the aforementioned compressive encoding can be realized by the same class of CRATE architectures. Thus, the so-derived white-box architectures are universal to both encoders and decoders. Experiments show that these networks, despite their simplicity, indeed learn to compress and sparsify representations of large-scale real-world image and text datasets, and achieve performance very close to highly engineered transformer-based models: ViT, MAE, DINO, BERT, and GPT2. We believe the proposed computational framework demonstrates great potential in bridging the gap between theory and practice of deep learning, from a unified perspective of data compression.

Spyx: A Library for Just-In-Time Compiled Optimization of Spiking Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: sparse attention implementation optimization*\n\n*Thomas Nowotny, Kade M. Heckel*\n\n**Abstract:** As the role of artificial intelligence becomes increasingly pivotal in modern society, the efficient training and deployment of deep neural networks have emerged as critical areas of focus. Recent advancements in attention-based large neural architectures have spurred the development of AI accelerators, facilitating the training of extensive, multi-billion parameter models. Despite their effectiveness, these powerful networks often incur high execution costs in production environments. Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological neural processes, offers a promising alternative. By utilizing temporally-sparse computations, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer to enhance energy efficiency through a reduced and low-power hardware footprint. However, the training of SNNs can be challenging due to their recurrent nature which cannot as easily leverage the massive parallelism of modern AI accelerators. To facilitate the investigation of SNN architectures and dynamics researchers have sought to bridge Python-based deep learning frameworks such as PyTorch or TensorFlow with custom-implemented compute kernels. This paper introduces Spyx, a new and lightweight SNN simulation and optimization library designed in JAX. By pre-staging data in the expansive vRAM of contemporary accelerators and employing extensive JIT compilation, Spyx allows for SNN optimization to be executed as a unified, low-level program on NVIDIA GPUs or Google TPUs. This approach achieves optimal hardware utilization, surpassing the performance of many existing SNN training frameworks while maintaining considerable flexibility.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-29\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on sparse attention implementations, memory access pattern optimizations, hardware-specific attention implementations, and performance comparisons, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Sparse Attention Implementations and Optimizations\n\n- **SeerAttention**: This mechanism learns intrinsic sparsity in attention maps rather than relying on predefined patterns. It uses a learnable gate to identify significant blocks in the attention map, allowing for block-sparse attention computation. This approach balances accuracy and speed, achieving near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels and significant speedup over dense baselines.\n\n- **S2-Attention**: This approach involves sharding the context heterogeneously among attention heads, where each head attends to a different subset of tokens. It uses a hardware-friendly sparse attention pattern and combines sparse and dense attention for efficiency and performance. S2-Attention achieves substantial speedups compared to dense counterparts and maintains strong downstream performance.\n\n## Memory Access Pattern Optimizations for Attention\n\n- **FlashAttention**: This algorithm optimizes memory access by using tiling and recomputation techniques. Tiling divides large matrices into smaller blocks, reducing memory usage and computation time. Recomputation avoids storing large intermediate matrices, enhancing memory efficiency and FLOP utilization. FlashAttention-2 further optimizes memory access by splitting the Q matrix instead of the K and V matrices, reducing memory accesses.\n\n- **SeerAttention with FlashAttention**: SeerAttention integrates with FlashAttention to leverage block-level sparsity, which aligns with the tiling computation scheme of FlashAttention. This integration ensures efficient learning of the gating network and reduces I/O and computation overhead.\n\n## Hardware-Specific Attention Implementations\n\n- **S2-Attention with Triton Library**: This approach uses the Triton library to provide kernel optimization for sparse attention. It efficiently tracks KV usage patterns and dynamically merges sparse query blocks, ensuring each tile is fully utilized regardless of sparsity granularity. This method is applicable in both training and inference, lowering the barrier to exploring novel sparse attention architectures.\n\n- **OpenVINO Runtime Optimization**: For sparse and 8-bit quantized models, OpenVINO runtime provides acceleration features. By enabling sparsity optimization, models can achieve significant performance improvements, especially in tasks like Question Answering and Sequence Classification. The optimization involves setting the \"CPU_SPARSE_WEIGHTS_DECOMPRESSION_RATE\" property to control the minimum sparsity rate for MatMul operations.\n\n## Performance Comparisons of Different Sparse Attention Approaches\n\n- **SeerAttention vs. Minference and MoA**: SeerAttention outperforms state-of-the-art sparse attention methods like Minference and MoA, offering strong adaptability to various context lengths and sparsity ratios. It maintains near-lossless accuracy even at high sparsity levels during long-context fine-tuning.\n\n- **S2-Attention vs. FlashAttention-2**: S2-Attention achieves wall-clock speedups of 8.79X, 15.87X, and 25.3X compared to the FlashAttention-2 baseline while maintaining strong downstream performance on-par with full attention. For 7B models, S2-Attention achieves a 4.5x speed-up in inference compared to dense counterparts.\n\nThese findings highlight the importance of learning-based sparse attention mechanisms, optimized memory access patterns, and hardware-specific implementations to improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

The design integrates a scoring network and differentiable top-k mask operator to dynamically select relevant key-value pairs, achieving linear time complexity and constant memory footprint while maintaining model expressiveness. Hardware-aware optimizations and efficient memory access patterns further improve performance.",
