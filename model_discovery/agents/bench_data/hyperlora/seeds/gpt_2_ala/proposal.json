Comprehensive Analysis of Strengths and Concerns\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- **Innovative Integration of Linear Attention and Meta-Learning:**\n  - The AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA) proposal adeptly combines linear attention mechanisms with meta-learning strategies. This synergy aims to reduce the computational complexity inherent in traditional Multi-Head Attention (MHA) while enhancing the model's adaptability and robustness. Drawing inspiration from **Fast Weight Layers (FWLs)** and **momentum-based attention**, ALA's **MetaLearner** component facilitates dynamic adjustment of attention weights, potentially leading to improved perplexity and generalization across diverse contexts.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability Improvements:**\n  - By leveraging linear attention, ALA seeks to transform the computational complexity from quadratic to linear with respect to sequence length. This mirrors advancements seen in internal sources like **Infini-attention** and external works such as **\"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry\"**, which have demonstrated significant efficiency gains. ALA's focus on maintaining or enhancing expressiveness while achieving linear complexity positions it well for scalability, enabling the handling of longer sequences without proportional increases in computational resources.\n\n- **Context-Adaptive Encoding Enhancements:**\n  - Incorporating context-adaptive encoding techniques, akin to **Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE)**, ALA enhances the model's ability to generalize across varied input contexts. This dynamic adjustment ensures that the attention mechanism remains relevant and effective regardless of input variations, thereby improving robustness and performance on downstream tasks.\n\n- **Alignment with Current Research Trends:**\n  - The proposal aligns seamlessly with contemporary research trajectories that emphasize the integration of meta-learning with attention mechanisms and the adoption of context-adaptive encoding. Studies such as **\"Why Can GPT Learn In-Context?\"** and **\"Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners\"** support the feasibility and potential benefits of ALA's approach, underscoring its relevance and timeliness in advancing autoregressive language models.\n\n**Concerns:**\n\n- **Potential Overlaps with Existing Designs:**\n  - While ALA introduces a novel integration of linear attention and meta-learning, there are notable overlaps with existing models like **Infini-attention**, **Attention Free Transformer (AFT)**, and **Fast Weight Layers (FWLs)**. These models also explore linear attention enhancements and dynamic parameter adjustments, raising questions about ALA's distinctiveness. To solidify its novelty, ALA must clearly articulate the unique aspects of its integration strategy and demonstrate how it offers advantages beyond these existing approaches.\n\n- **Novelty Challenges:**\n  - Establishing the novelty of ALA is paramount, given the prevalence of similar integrations in recent research. The proposal should emphasize unique contributions, such as specific meta-learning algorithms employed, novel augmentation techniques for linear attention, or distinctive context-adaptive encoding strategies that set it apart from models like **Hedgehog** and **Infini-attention**.\n\n- **Computational Overhead from Meta-Learning:**\n  - Integrating meta-learning strategies, while beneficial for adaptability, may introduce additional computational overhead. This concern is highlighted by internal sources like **\"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding\"**, where efficiency gains are achieved without significantly increasing computational demands. ALA must ensure that the meta-learning component does not negate the efficiency benefits provided by linear attention.\n\n- **Implementation Complexity:**\n  - The combined integration of linear attention, context-adaptive encoding, and meta-learning introduces layers of complexity to the model's architecture. Ensuring seamless cooperation among these components without destabilizing training processes is a challenge. Detailed implementation guidelines and modular design approaches are essential to mitigate potential integration issues.\n\n- **Empirical Validation Needs:**\n  - While theoretical benefits are promising, empirical validation is crucial to substantiate the claims of improved perplexity, speed, and robustness. Comparative benchmarks against both traditional MHA and similar linear attention models like **AFT** and **Infini-attention** are necessary to demonstrate ALA's efficacy and performance improvements in real-world scenarios.\n\n#### 2. Constructive Suggestions for Improvements or Areas Needing Clarification\n\n- **Distinctive Contribution Elaboration:**\n  - Clearly delineate how ALA's integration of linear attention and meta-learning differs from existing models. Highlighting specific innovations, such as unique meta-learning frameworks or novel context-adaptive encoding techniques, will reinforce the proposal's originality and value.\n\n- **Detailed Empirical Benchmarking:**\n  - Incorporate comprehensive empirical evaluations comparing ALA against traditional MHA, **AFT**, **Infini-attention**, and other relevant models. Metrics should include perplexity reduction, generation speed improvements, and performance across diverse downstream tasks to showcase ALA's advantages effectively.\n\n- **Optimization Strategies for Meta-Learning:**\n  - Provide detailed strategies to optimize the meta-learning component's computational efficiency. This could involve leveraging lightweight meta-learning algorithms or incorporating gradient optimization techniques that minimize overhead while maintaining adaptability.\n\n- **Robustness and Stability Measures:**\n  - Address potential training stability issues by incorporating gradient flow analysis similar to **\"Training Dynamics of Transformers to Recognize Word Co-occurrence via Gradient Flow Analysis.\"** Implement techniques like gradient clipping or adaptive learning rates to ensure stable training dynamics despite the added complexity of meta-learning components.\n\n- **Implementation Guidelines and Modular Design:**\n  - Offer detailed implementation guidelines that outline how the linear attention, context-adaptive encoding, and meta-learning modules interact within the ALA framework. Emphasizing a modular design can facilitate easier integration, testing, and optimization, reducing the risk of integration-related bugs or inefficiencies.\n\n- **Scalability Provisions:**\n  - Discuss scalability in greater depth, outlining how ALA can be adapted for larger models or more extensive datasets. This could involve exploring distributed training mechanisms or memory optimization techniques to handle increased model sizes without compromising performance.\n\n- **Exploration of Additional Applications:**\n  - Highlight potential applications beyond language modeling where ALA's enhanced attention mechanisms and adaptability could provide significant benefits. This could include areas like multimodal learning, real-time processing, or specialized domains requiring high robustness and efficiency.\n\n#### 3.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/41 (Score: 0.93)*\n\n```\n# When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models \n\nHaoran You ${ }^{1}$ Yichao Fu ${ }^{1}$ Zheng Wang ${ }^{1}$ Amir Yazdanbakhsh ${ }^{2}$ Yingyan (Celine) Lin ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAutoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/41 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\n3. Downstream Tasks on LLaMA-2-7B. We analysis six downstream tasks: BBH, PIQA, MMLU, COPA, ARCC, and AGNews. Using standard evaluation settings, MMLU was tested with 5 shots, BBH with 3 shots, and the remaining tasks with zero shots. As shown in Tab. 7, our augmented linear attention not only reduces perplexity but also improves accuracy across all tasks. Specifically, with models like FLASH, our method achieved an average accuracy improvement of $3.53 \\%$. In addition, we extend our methods to three more linear attention methods, with summarized results in Appendix H. Generation Speedups by Integrating LAs with Speculative Decoding. We benchmark the speedups of our compatible LAs with speculative decoding. As shown in Tab. 8, we test the LLaMA-7B/13B models which are adapted into a chat model format, similar to LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c). Following Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), we train Medusa heads for speculative decoding. Speed tests for the 7B and 13B models are conducted on a single A100-80GB GPU, we observe that our revised LAs are compatible with speculative decoding and approximately doubled the speed. Table 9.

LA | $49.7 \\mathrm{~ms}(\\mathbf{- 6 4 \\%})$ | 32.2 ms | 8.2 ms | 9.3 ms |\n\n### 5.3. Ablation Study\n\nComparison with Direct Integration. To verify the effectiveness of our causal and compatible augmentation techniques, we compare them with the direct integration of previous linear attention FLASH (Hua et al., 2022) and the speculative decoding method Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b). As shown in Tab. 9, our method applied to LLaMA-2-7B models on A100 GPUs for a single batch of speculative decoding ( 64 speculated tokens and 42 sequence candidates), achieves a $64 \\%$ reduction in total latency compared to the direct integration, while also reducing QKV memory requirements by $75 \\%$ from 0.4 GB to 0.1 GB . Our techniques outperform direct integration because standard implementations, even with linear attention like FLASH and speculative decoding like Medusa, face two key limitations without our augmentations: (1) slow sequencebased decoding and (2) lack of optimizations such as shared cumulative sum (cumsum) and key-value (KV) states for batch processing. Conventional strategies for compatible KV caching rely on sequence-based decoding, assigning distinct KV caches to each speculated sequence candidate, as shown in Fig. 7. This results in unnecessary computational effort and memory inefficiency since candidates with identical prefixes are processed separately. In contrast, our method addresses these issues by ensuring identical prefixes are computed only once, mitigating these issues with timedependent causal and compatible augmentation in linear attention and speculative decoding. Our LA Speedups. We benchmarked the training speed of FLASH using both the original attention and our augmented LAs, with a batch size of 1 , on a single A100-40G GPU. Our results show that the augmented LAs significantly improve training speed. For sequence lengths of 4 K and 8 K , they are $1.52 \\times$ and $2.94 \\times$ faster, respectively. FLASH with augmented LAs takes 1.05 seconds and 1.95 seconds per training step for 4 K and 8 K sequences, compared to 1.60 seconds and 5.74 seconds with the original attention. The group size in FLASH was consistently set to 256. Extend to Longer Sequence. We fine-tuned LLaMA-27 B to extend its sequence length from 4 K to 8 K using our augmented LAs, following LongLora (Chen et al., 2023c) setting on the RedPajama dataset. For a fair comparison, we used only the local attention in LongLora, maintaining a block size of 256 . Our augmented LAs reduced perplexity from 15.29 to 13.86 , demonstrating their effectiveness in handling longer sequences. ## 6. Conclusion\n\nThis paper presents the first empirical analysis of linearized autoregressive LLMs, revealing significant limitations of existing linear attention methods in effectively handling masked attention and integration with speculative decoding. To address these challenges, we introduced an approach that combines effective local augmentation with seamless compatibility for speculative decoding. Our experiments across a range of LLMs consistently demonstrate that our method achieves substantial performance gains. Notably, we achieve up to a 6.67 perplexity reduction and up to $2 \\times$ speedups in generation compared to existing linear attention methods. Our work paves the way for more efficient training and deployment of powerful autoregressive LLMs, especially for long-sequence applications. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work is supported by the National Science Foundation (NSF) EPCN program (Award number: 1934767) and the CoCoSys, one of the seven centers in JUMP 2.0, a Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC) program sponsored by DARPA.

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), exemplified by OpenAI's GPT- 3 with its 175 billion parameters, have underscored the significant data and computational power required for such technologies. Training models of this scale incur substantial costs, both financially and environmentally. For instance, the cost necessary to train GPT-3 could exceed 4 million equivalent GPU hours (Brown et al., 2020), and the carbon footprint of training a single Transformer model might rival the lifetime emissions of five average American cars (Strubell et al., 2019). Addressing the challenges of efficient training and serving of LLMs is therefore not only a technical imperative but also an environmental and ethical necessity. Societal Consequences. The success of this project in enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs will have far-reaching implications, especially in processing long sequences commonly encountered in document handling. Our\nefforts are set to substantially influence various societal and economic sectors. The enhanced efficiency of LLMs promises transformative changes in diverse applications ranging from document summarization and question answering to personal digital assistants, security, and augmented reality. The development and exploration of linearized LLMs mark a pivotal progress in rendering these models both more accessible and environmentally sustainable. ## References\n\nAgrawal, A., Kedia, N., Panwar, A., Mohan, J., Kwatra, N., Gulavani, B.

Bhatele*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Loki is proposed, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space, and is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Inference on large language models can be expensive in terms of the compute and memory costs involved, especially when long sequence lengths are used. In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.37)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Transformers are RNNs: Fast Autoregressive Transformers with Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Angelos Katharopoulos, Apoorv Vyas, Nikolaos Pappas, Franccois Fleuret*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work expresses the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and makes use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from O(N) to N, where N is the sequence length.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers achieve remarkable performance in several tasks but due to their quadratic complexity, with respect to the input's length, they are prohibitively slow for very long sequences. To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 2.

Sra*\n\n**TL;DR:** The results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer training is notoriously difficult, requiring a careful design of optimizers and use of various heuristics. We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics. Consequently, the results obtained in this paper suggest that a simple linearized Transformer model could actually be a valuable, realistic abstraction for understanding Transformer optimization.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Chelsea Finn, P. Abbeel, S. Levine*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning is proposed.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the sense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and applicable to a variety of different learning problems, including classification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of meta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it can solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this approach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image classification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and accelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural network policies.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2017\n\n**Citations:** 10635  (*Influential: 2353*)\n\n#### 4. Neural Relational Inference with Fast Modular Meta-learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Ferran Alet, Erica Weng, Tomas Lozano-Perez, L. Kaelbling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-learns a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed in the large search space of graph neural network compositions.\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) are effective models for many dynamical systems consisting of entities and relations. Although most GNN applications assume a single type of entity and relation, many situations involve multiple types of interactions. Relational inference is the problem of inferring these interactions and learning the dynamics from observational data. We frame relational inference as a modular meta-learning problem, where neural modules are trained to be composed in different ways to solve many tasks. This meta-learning framework allows us to implicitly encode time invariance and infer relations in context of one another rather than independently, which increases inference capacity. Framing inference as the inner-loop optimization of meta-learning leads to a model-based approach that is more data-efficient and capable of estimating the state of entities that we do not observe directly, but whose existence can be inferred from their effect on observed entities. To address the large search space of graph neural network compositions, we meta-learn a proposal function that speeds up the inner-loop simulated annealing search within the modular meta-learning algorithm, providing two orders of magnitude increase in the size of problems that can be addressed.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 55  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 5.

Hadsell*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows that latent embedding optimization can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the competitive miniImageNet and tieredImageNet few-shot classification tasks, and indicates LEO is able to capture uncertainty in the data, and can perform adaptation more effectively by optimizing in latent space.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient-based meta-learning techniques are both widely applicable and proficient at solving challenging few-shot learning and fast adaptation problems. However, they have practical difficulties when operating on high-dimensional parameter spaces in extreme low-data regimes. We show that it is possible to bypass these limitations by learning a data-dependent latent generative representation of model parameters, and performing gradient-based meta-learning in this low-dimensional latent space. The resulting approach, latent embedding optimization (LEO), decouples the gradient-based adaptation procedure from the underlying high-dimensional space of model parameters. Our evaluation shows that LEO can achieve state-of-the-art performance on the competitive miniImageNet and tieredImageNet few-shot classification tasks. Further analysis indicates LEO is able to capture uncertainty in the data, and can perform adaptation more effectively by optimizing in latent space.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 1297  (*Influential: 116*)\n\n#### 6. 3DILG: Irregular Latent Grids for 3D Generative Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Biao Zhang, M. Nie\u00dfner, Peter Wonka*\n\n**TL;DR:** In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, the shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new representation for encoding 3D shapes as neural fields. The representation is designed to be compatible with the transformer architecture and to benefit both shape reconstruction and shape generation. Existing works on neural fields are grid-based representations with latents defined on a regular grid. In contrast, we define latents on irregular grids, enabling our representation to be sparse and adaptive. In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, our shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. For shape generation, our representation promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models. We show different applications that improve over the current state of the art. First, we show results for probabilistic shape reconstruction from a single higher resolution image. Second, we train a probabilistic model conditioned on very low resolution images. Third, we apply our model to category-conditioned generation. All probabilistic experiments confirm that we are able to generate detailed and high quality shapes to yield the new state of the art in generative 3D shape modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7. Improved Visual Story Generation with Adaptive Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Zhangyin Feng, Yuchen Ren, Xinmiao Yu, Xiaocheng Feng, Duyu Tang, Shuming Shi, Bing Qin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple method is presented that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models developed on top of powerful text-to-image generation models like Stable Diffusion achieve remarkable success in visual story generation. However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios. We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. LayoutPointer: A Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network for Visual Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yongping Xiong, Guibin Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention, and recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE), as a crucial task of Document Intelligence, involves two primary sub-tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition (SER) and Relation Extraction (RE). However, VIE faces two significant challenges. Firstly, most existing models inadequately utilize spatial information of entities, often failing to predict connections or incorrectly linking spatially distant entities. Secondly, the improper input order of tokens challenges in extracting complete entity pairs from documents with multi-line entities when text is extracted via PDF parser or OCR. To address these challenges, we propose LayoutPointer, a Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network. LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention. Furthermore, we recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities. To better evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we reconstruct a multi-line dataset named MLFUD, which more accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Fine-tuning experimental results on FUNSD, XFUND, and MLFUD datasets demonstrate that LayoutPointer significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in F1 scores for RE tasks (e.g., 5.71% improvement on XFUND using LayoutPointer_{\\text{BASE-X}} over LayoutLMv3).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also\nenables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear\nattention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText-103 for\n125M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into\na viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B\nachieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model,\nwhere prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops.\n\n**Published:** 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z  (*Updated: 2024-02-06T19:31:26Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. A Review on Semi-Supervised Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Yusen Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Relation extraction (RE) plays an important role in extracting knowledge from\nunstructured text but requires a large amount of labeled corpus. To reduce the\nexpensive annotation efforts, semisupervised learning aims to leverage both\nlabeled and unlabeled data. In this paper, we review and compare three typical\nmethods in semi-supervised RE with deep learning or meta-learning:\nself-ensembling, which forces consistent under perturbations but may confront\ninsufficient supervision; self-training, which iteratively generates pseudo\nlabels and retrain itself with the enlarged labeled set; dual learning, which\nleverages a primal task and a dual task to give mutual feedback. Mean-teacher\n(Tarvainen and Valpola, 2017), LST (Li et al., 2019), and DualRE (Lin et al.,\n2019) are elaborated as the representatives to alleviate the weakness of these\nthree methods, respectively.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-12T23:43:23Z  (*Updated: 2021-03-12T23:43:23Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Meta-Learning Update Rules for Unsupervised Representation Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Jascha Sohl-Dickstein, Luke Metz, Brian Cheung, Niru Maheswaranathan*\n\n**Abstract:** A major goal of unsupervised learning is to discover data representations\nthat are useful for subsequent tasks, without access to supervised labels\nduring training. Typically, this involves minimizing a surrogate objective,\nsuch as the negative log likelihood of a generative model, with the hope that\nrepresentations useful for subsequent tasks will arise as a side effect. In\nthis work, we propose instead to directly target later desired tasks by\nmeta-learning an unsupervised learning rule which leads to representations\nuseful for those tasks. Specifically, we target semi-supervised classification\nperformance, and we meta-learn an algorithm -- an unsupervised weight update\nrule -- that produces representations useful for this task. Additionally, we\nconstrain our unsupervised update rule to a be a biologically-motivated,\nneuron-local function, which enables it to generalize to different neural\nnetwork architectures, datasets, and data modalities. We show that the\nmeta-learned update rule produces useful features and sometimes outperforms\nexisting unsupervised learning techniques. We further show that the\nmeta-learned unsupervised update rule generalizes to train networks with\ndifferent widths, depths, and nonlinearities. It also generalizes to train on\ndata with randomly permuted input dimensions and even generalizes from image\ndatasets to a text task.\n\n**Proceeding:** iclr-2019-5\n\n**Published:** 2018-03-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Meta-Learning Requires Meta-Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning*\n\n*Janarthanan Rajendran, Eric Jang, Alex Irpan*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning algorithms aim to learn two components: a model that predicts targets for a task, and a base learner that quickly updates that model when given examples from a new task. This additional level of learning can be powerful, but it also creates another potential source for overfitting, since we can now overfit in either the model or the base learner. We describe both of these forms of metalearning overfitting, and demonstrate that they appear experimentally in common meta-learning benchmarks. We then use an information-theoretic framework to discuss meta-augmentation, a way to add randomness that discourages the base learner and model from learning trivial solutions that do not generalize to new tasks. We demonstrate that meta-augmentation produces large complementary benefits to recently proposed meta-regularization techniques.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-07-10\n\n\n\n#### 5. Residual Learning and Context Encoding for Adaptive Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Joni Pajarinen, Aidan Scannell, Mohammadreza Nakhaei*\n\n**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning sequential behavior from fixed datasets. Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations, many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance. In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications, such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover, the dynamics may vary during the online fine-tuning. To address this problem of changing dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support dynamics' changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way, whilst comparison methods cannot.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*John Wieting, Iulia Turc, Dan Garrette, Jonathan H. Clark*\n\n**Abstract:** Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 2.8 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having 28% fewer model parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design, particularly focusing on the integration of linear attention mechanisms, meta-learning frameworks, and context-adaptive encoding, here are some key findings and suggestions:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\n- The use of linear attention mechanisms can significantly reduce computational complexity. For instance, the work on \"Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time\" shows that multi-head linear attention outperforms both single-layer and multi-layer linear attention, achieving faster convergence and comparable results to more complex algorithms. This suggests that adding more heads rather than layers can improve optimization and efficiency.\n- The \"Sana: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear DiT\" paper introduces a linear DiT that replaces vanilla quadratic attention modules with linear attention, reducing computational complexity from \\(O(N^2)\\) to \\(O(N)\\). This approach can be adapted for language models to enhance efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Implementation\n- The \"FastTTTLinear\" design, which integrates Gated Linear Attention, achieves linear complexity and addresses scalability and efficiency challenges. This could be a direct area of exploration for integrating linear attention into the existing GPT-2 architecture.\n\n## Meta-Learning Frameworks\n\n### Dynamic Adaptation\n- Meta-learning frameworks like \"MetaTTT\" introduce dynamic adaptation of hidden states during inference, which can enhance test-time adaptability and efficiency. This approach focuses on uncertainty-aware compression and can be beneficial for improving the expressiveness and efficiency of the model.\n- Exploring other meta-learning frameworks that allow the model to adapt dynamically during inference can enhance the model's scalability and robustness. For example, frameworks that use gradient-based meta-learning to adjust model parameters based on the input context could be highly effective.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n\n### Robustness and Generalization\n- The \"CAPE\" method introduces context-adaptive positional encoding, which dynamically adjusts based on the input context. This can enhance the model's ability to generalize across different sequence lengths and contexts, improving robustness.\n- Integrating context-adaptive mechanisms can help the model handle varied input lengths and contexts more effectively, which is crucial for real-world applications where input variability is common.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Over-Parameterization\n- The study on \"Learning Linear Attention in Polynomial Time\" highlights that over-parameterization through adding more attention heads rather than layers can provide optimization benefits. This suggests that the type of over-parameterization matters significantly in learning linear attention networks.\n\n### Computational Efficiency\n- The use of Block Sparse Attention, as discussed in the MIT HAN Lab's work, can significantly reduce the computational costs of large language models by leveraging the inherent sparsity in attention patterns. This approach can be combined with linear attention mechanisms to further enhance efficiency and scalability.\n\n### Training Strategies\n- The \"Sana: Efficient High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Linear DiT\" paper also proposes a multi-stage training strategy to improve training stability, which could be adapted for language models to enhance their training efficiency and stability.\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is more efficient, scalable, and robust:\n\n- **Efficiency**: Use linear attention mechanisms to reduce computational complexity.\n- **Scalability**: Employ meta-learning frameworks for dynamic adaptation during inference.\n- **Robustness**: Implement context-adaptive encoding to handle varied input lengths and contexts.\n- **Training Strategies**: Utilize multi-stage training strategies and optimize over-parameterization techniques to improve training stability and efficiency.\n",

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Introduction\n\nRecently, Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) have shown immense capability in sequential modeling and been widely used in various areas, such as natural language processing\n\n[^0](Devlin et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020), computer vision (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021), time series analysis (Zhou et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) and reinforcement learning (Chen et al., 2021b; Janner et al., 2021). Based on attention mechanisms, Transformers can learn the relation between each pair of tokens in a sequence. However, suffering from the quadratic complexity of pairwise relation modeling, it is computationally prohibitive for Transformers to deal with long sequences and scale up to bigger models. To tackle this essential obstacle for foundation models (Bommasani et al., 2021), efficient and linear Transformers have been explored. One category of methods attempts to utilize the sparsity to reduce the model captured relations (Child et al., 2019; Vyas et al., 2020; Zaheer et al., 2020). By substituting the dense matrix to a sparse version, these models can obtain a lower complexity but inevitably sacrifice some valuable information, leading to the trade-off dilemma between efficiency and performance. Another mainstream category tries to abandon the computationconsuming query-key multiplication in the attention mechanism. The typical method is to substitute or approximate the softmax-based similarity in Transformers. For example, Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) introduces the decomposition method for similarity calculation and further bypasses the query-key multiplication through the associativity of matrix multiplication. However, without using the softmax function, these methods cannot guarantee the distinguishability of attention. This may result in nearuniform attention of each token to all other tokens, namely the degenerated attention, which damages the effectiveness of the attention mechanism. Although some works try to incorporate the concentration property to avoid the trivial attention (Luo et al., 2021; Zhen et al., 2022), they have to reintroduce specific inductive biases to Transformers, such as the locality in sequence, sacrificing the model generality. Thus, how to simultaneously obtain the non-trivial attention and maintain the generality as the canonical attention is the key challenge in the advance of linearizing Transformers. Previous works demonstrate that the softmax function is essential to avoid the trivial attention (Choromanski et al., 2021; Peng et al., 2021). It is well-known that the softmax function is originally proposed as a differentiable generalization of the \"winner-take-all\" picking maximum operation (Bridle, 1989). Thus, the softmax function can introduce\nthe competition among tokens in the attention mechanism, enforcing higher attention only to the essential tokens and thereby avoiding near-uniform attention weights. Based on this insight, it is a natural solution to empower transformers with built-in competition property to generate informative attention that guarantees the modeling capability. However, the competition mechanism is irrealizable for linear Transformers because the attention weights to compete will incur the quadratic complexity. To tackle the aforementioned problems, we attempt to reconstruct the attention mechanism from a new view of flow network (Ahuja et al., 1993), where the competition property is naturally achieved. Note that a flow network is a directed graph with information flows from one node to another under the constraint of flow capacity. Correspondingly, the attention mechanism can be reformulated as aggregating the information from sources (i.e., values) to sinks (i.e., results) through the learned flow capacities (i.e., attentions). We further find that by conserving the incoming flow capacity for each sink, the outgoing flow capacities of sources will compete with each other. And by conserving the outgoing flow capacity of sources, we can also obtain the competed incoming flow capacities of sinks. Thus, benefiting from the flow conservation in flow network, the competition mechanism can be accomplished without specific inductive biases. Based on the above insights, we introduce the flow conservation to the attention mechanism and further propose the Flow-Attention mechanism, which can avoid the trivial attention and simultaneously be free from specific inductive biases. Technically, by conserving the incoming flow of sinks (i.e., results), the source competition mechanism is accomplished and then applied for the non-trivial information aggregation. After the information aggregation, the sink allocation mechanism is obtained by conserving the outgoing flow of sources (i.e., values) and then applied to filter the aggregated information. Empowered by the Flow-Attention, Flowformer in linear complexity achieves competitive or better performance as the canonical Transformer in extensive areas. The contributions are summarized as follows:\n\n- This paper analyzes the attention mechanism from the new view of the flow network. By introducing the flow conservation to both the source and sink aspects, the competition among tokens is naturally achieved. - Based on flow conservation, we propose the FlowAttention with source competition and sink allocation mechanisms, which can avoid degenerated attentions without incorporating specific inductive biases. - Empowered by Flow-Attention, our proposed Flowformer yields strong performance in linear time on five benchmarks, covering wide areas: long sequence, language, vision, time series and reinforcement learning.\n```\n\n#### 3.

Introduction\n\nLinear attention has emerged as a potentially viable alternative to conventional softmax attention over the last five years (Bahdanau et al., 2016; de Br\u00e9bisson \\& Vincent, 2016). [^0]However, despite its promise, none of the current leading large language models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Zeng et al., 2022; Black et al., 2022; Almazrouei et al., 2023; Team et al., 2023; Wang \\& Komatsuzaki, 2021; Baichuan, 2023; Jiang et al., 2023) have adopted linear attention mechanisms. There are two possible reasons for that: 1). Inferior performance: There is a notable performance gap between existing linear attention-based models (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and state-of-the-art softmax attentionbased models (Touvron et al., 2023a;b) in language modeling. 2). Slow training speed: Existing linear attention models frequently struggle with slow training speeds due to the use of cumulative summation operations (cumsum) (Hua et al., 2022). As a result, these models (Hua et al., 2022) often adopt conventional attention computation during practical use, losing the theoretical advantages of linear attention. In this paper, we address the aforementioned issues of linear attention and propose a new linear attention-based model that outperforms softmax attention-based models in terms of accuracy and efficiency in language modeling. Training speed. We introduce Lightning Attention, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve the linear computational complexities, the core idea is to leverage the \"kernel trick\" to accelerate the attention matrix computation, i.e., compute the product of keys and values first to circumvent the $n \\times n$ query-key matrix multiplication. The slow operation cumsum is needed during the calculation in causal language modeling. To solve this dilemma, we apply the concept of \"divide and conquer\" to perform the calculation. Specifically, our attention calculation is divided into intra-blocks and inter-blocks. The conventional attention calculation is applied to intra-blocks, while the \"kernel trick\" is utilized for inter-blocks. We also leverage tiling techniques in both forward and backward processes to maximize GPU hardware performance and tailor the technique used in FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022a; Dao, 2023) to our Lightning Attention to make it IO-friendly. As a result, Lightning Attention maintains a constant training speed with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption, as shown in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 4. Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/25 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nWith its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1.

It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

To address this limitation, we express the self-attention as a linear dot-product of kernel feature maps and make use of the associativity property of matrix products to reduce the complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N^2\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(N\\right)$, where $N$ is the sequence length. We show that this formulation permits an iterative implementation that dramatically accelerates autoregressive transformers and reveals their relationship to recurrent neural networks. Our linear transformers achieve similar performance to vanilla transformers and they are up to 4000x faster on autoregressive prediction of very long sequences.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1334  (*Influential: 177*)\n\n#### 2.

We make progress towards understanding the subtleties of training Transformers by carefully studying a simple yet canonical linearized shallow Transformer model. Specifically, we train linear Transformers to solve regression tasks, inspired by J.~von Oswald et al.~(ICML 2023), and K.~Ahn et al.~(NeurIPS 2023). Most importantly, we observe that our proposed linearized models can reproduce several prominent aspects of Transformer training dynamics.

However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4.

Our method adapts pre-trained models to larger-scale problems in test time by suggesting two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled adaptation with guided exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation of SAGE based on scale information. Then, SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias, which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location. The locality bias gradually decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative CO tasks.

The representation is designed to be compatible with the transformer architecture and to benefit both shape reconstruction and shape generation. Existing works on neural fields are grid-based representations with latents defined on a regular grid. In contrast, we define latents on irregular grids, enabling our representation to be sparse and adaptive. In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, our shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. For shape generation, our representation promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models. We show different applications that improve over the current state of the art. First, we show results for probabilistic shape reconstruction from a single higher resolution image. Second, we train a probabilistic model conditioned on very low resolution images. Third, we apply our model to category-conditioned generation. All probabilistic experiments confirm that we are able to generate detailed and high quality shapes to yield the new state of the art in generative 3D shape modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 6.

However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios.

LayoutPointer: A Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network for Visual Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yongping Xiong, Guibin Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention, and recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE), as a crucial task of Document Intelligence, involves two primary sub-tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition (SER) and Relation Extraction (RE). However, VIE faces two significant challenges. Firstly, most existing models inadequately utilize spatial information of entities, often failing to predict connections or incorrectly linking spatially distant entities. Secondly, the improper input order of tokens challenges in extracting complete entity pairs from documents with multi-line entities when text is extracted via PDF parser or OCR. To address these challenges, we propose LayoutPointer, a Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network. LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention. Furthermore, we recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities. To better evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we reconstruct a multi-line dataset named MLFUD, which more accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Fine-tuning experimental results on FUNSD, XFUND, and MLFUD datasets demonstrate that LayoutPointer significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in F1 scores for RE tasks (e.g., 5.71% improvement on XFUND using LayoutPointer_{\\text{BASE-X}} over LayoutLMv3).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax\n  Mimicry\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Michael Zhang, Kush Bhatia, Hermann Kumbong, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attentions have shown potential for improving Transformer efficiency,\nreducing attention's quadratic complexity to linear in sequence length. This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but\ncan simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden\nstates, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear\nattention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current\nimplementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than\nhighly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a\nhardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory\nmovement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed\nFLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a\nstandalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize\nthis algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with\ndata-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention\nlayer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer\nis found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer\n(Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as\nRetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu & Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale\nlanguage modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at\nlength generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to\nsequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For\ntraining speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a\nsimilarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-11T18:51:59Z  (*Updated: 2024-08-27T01:27:29Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Train Short, Test Long: Attention with Linear Biases Enables Input Length Extrapolation\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Mike Lewis, Noah A. Smith, Ofir Press*\n\n**Abstract:** Since the introduction of the transformer model by Vaswani et al. (2017), a fundamental question has yet to be answered: how does a model achieve extrapolation at inference time for sequences that are longer than it saw during training? We first show that extrapolation can be enabled by simply changing the position representation method, though we find that current methods do not allow for efficient extrapolation. We therefore introduce a simpler and more efficient position method, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi). ALiBi does not add positional embeddings to word embeddings; instead, it biases query-key attention scores with a penalty that is proportional to their distance. We show that this method trains a 1.3 billion parameter model on input sequences of length 1024 that extrapolates to input sequences of length 2048, achieving the same perplexity as a sinusoidal position embedding model trained on inputs of length 2048 but training 11% faster and using 11% less memory. ALiBi's inductive bias towards recency also leads it to outperform multiple strong position methods on the WikiText-103 benchmark.\n\n**Conference:** train-short-test-long-attention-with-linear-1\n\n**Published:** 2021-08-27\n\n\n\n#### 2. Linformer: Self-Attention with Linear Complexity\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention*\n\n*Madian Khabsa, Hao Ma, Sinong Wang, Belinda Z. Li, Han Fang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large transformer models have shown extraordinary success in achieving state-of-the-art results in many natural language processing applications. However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-08\n\n\n\n#### 3. Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning adaptation*\n\n*Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the\nsense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and\napplicable to a variety of different learning problems, including\nclassification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of\nmeta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it\ncan solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In\nour approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a\nsmall number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new\ntask will produce good generalization performance on that task.

Arnold*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning methods, most notably Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Finn et al, 2017) or MAML, have achieved great success in adapting to new tasks quickly, after having been trained on similar tasks.\nThe mechanism behind their success, however, is poorly understood.\nWe begin this work with an experimental analysis of MAML, finding that deep models are crucial for its success, even given sets of simple tasks where a linear model would suffice on any individual task.\nFurthermore, on image-recognition tasks, we find that the early layers of MAML-trained models learn task-invariant features, while later layers are used for adaptation, providing further evidence that these models require greater capacity than is strictly necessary for their individual tasks.\nFollowing our findings, we propose a method which enables better use of model capacity at inference time by separating the adaptation aspect of meta-learning into parameters that are only used for adaptation but are not part of the forward model.\nWe find that our approach enables more effective meta-learning in smaller models, which are suitably sized for the individual tasks.\n\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-25\n\n\n\n#### 5. Residual Learning and Context Encoding for Adaptive Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Joni Pajarinen, Aidan Scannell, Mohammadreza Nakhaei*\n\n**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning sequential behavior from fixed datasets. Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations, many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance. In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications, such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover, the dynamics may vary during the online fine-tuning. To address this problem of changing dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support dynamics' changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way, whilst comparison methods cannot.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*John Wieting, Iulia Turc, Dan Garrette, Jonathan H. Clark*\n\n**Abstract:** Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 2.8 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having 28% fewer model parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating linear attention mechanisms, meta-learning adaptation, and context-adaptive encoding, here are some key insights and practical implementation challenges based on the provided references and additional information:\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Efficiency and Scalability\nLinear attention mechanisms can significantly reduce the computational complexity of Transformer models from quadratic to linear, which is crucial for handling long sequences efficiently. This is achieved by avoiding the need for pairwise comparisons between all elements in the input sequence, a major bottleneck in traditional self-attention mechanisms.\n\n### Practical Implementation Challenges\n- **Computational Reduction**: Implementing linear attention involves replacing the dot-product attention with linear transformations that can capture similar contextual information but with reduced computational overhead. However, this may require careful tuning of the linear layers to ensure they capture the necessary contextual dependencies.\n- **Integration with Existing Architectures**: When integrating linear attention into existing Transformer architectures, it is important to ensure that the model's overall structure and training process are adapted accordingly. This might involve adjusting the number of layers, the dimensionality of the embeddings, and the training hyperparameters to optimize performance.\n\n## Meta-Learning for Dynamic Adaptation\n\n### Adaptability and Robustness\nMeta-learning frameworks, such as Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), enable models to adapt quickly to new tasks and inputs. This can be particularly beneficial for autoregressive language models that need to handle diverse and dynamic input contexts. Meta-learning allows the model to learn how to learn from new data efficiently, enhancing its robustness and adaptability.\n\n### Practical Implementation Challenges\n- **Training Complexity**: Implementing meta-learning involves a nested optimization process, which can be computationally expensive and complex to manage. Ensuring that the meta-learning process is stable and efficient is crucial for practical deployment.\n- **Task Adaptation**: The model needs to be trained on a variety of tasks to learn the meta-learning capabilities. This requires a diverse set of training data and careful design of the meta-learning objectives to ensure the model adapts well to new tasks without overfitting.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n\n### Generalization and Robustness\nContext-adaptive positional encoding methods, such as CAPE, dynamically adjust the positional encodings based on the input context. This improves the model's ability to generalize across different sequence lengths and contexts, which is essential for real-world applications where input variability is high.\n\n### Practical Implementation Challenges\n- **Dynamic Adjustment**: Implementing context-adaptive encoding requires designing mechanisms that can dynamically adjust the positional encodings based on the input. This involves additional computational steps and careful tuning to ensure that the encodings capture the relevant contextual information effectively.\n- **Sequence Length Handling**: Ensuring that the model can handle sequences of varying lengths without performance degradation is a challenge. Techniques like relative positional encoding can help, but integrating these with context-adaptive encoding requires careful consideration of how the model processes and generalizes across different sequence lengths.\n\n## Additional Insights\n\n### Redundancy in Attention Layers\nResearch has shown that a significant portion of attention layers in Transformer models can be pruned without degrading performance, indicating redundancy in these layers. This insight can be leveraged to further optimize the model by removing redundant attention layers, thereby reducing computational and memory costs while maintaining performance.\n\n### Efficient Attention Mechanisms\nDeveloping variants of the attention mechanism, such as sparse attention or hierarchical attention, can help in scaling up the model efficiently. These mechanisms allow the model to focus on a subset of the input or process the input at multiple levels of granularity, which can be particularly useful for handling long sequences and improving overall efficiency.\n\nBy addressing these practical implementation challenges and leveraging the insights from linear attention, meta-learning, and context-adaptive encoding, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and robust autoregressive language models.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called WebText. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the CoQA dataset matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, GPT-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underfits WebText. Samples from the model reflect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text.

Generalizable Multi-linear Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention integration*\n\n*Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition and introduces the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information.\n\n**Abstract:** The majority of existing multimodal sequential learning methods focus on how to obtain powerful individual representations and neglect to effectively capture the multimodal joint representation. Bilinear attention network (BAN) is a commonly used integration method, which leverages tensor operations to associate the features of different modalities. However, BAN has a poor compatibility for more modalities, since the computational complexity of the attention map increases exponentially with the number of modalities. Based on this concern, we propose a new method called generalizable multi-linear attention network (MAN), which can associate more modalities in acceptable complexity with hierarchical approximation decomposition. Speci\ufb01cally, considering the fact that softmax attention kernels cannot be decomposed as linear operation directly, we adopt the addition random features mechanism to approximate the non-linear softmax functions with enough theoretical analysis. Furthermore, we also introduce the local sequential constraints, which can be combined with ARF conveniently, as positional information. We conduct extensive experiments on several datasets of corresponding tasks, the experimental results show that MAN could achieve competitive results compared with baseline methods, showcasing the effectiveness of our contributions.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. HyperAttention: Long-context Attention in Near-Linear Time\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention integration*\n\n*Insu Han, Rajesh Jayaram, Amin Karbasi, V. Mirrokni, David P. Woodruff, A. Zandieh*\n\n**TL;DR:** An approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention is presented to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models, and is able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank.\n\n**Abstract:** We present an approximate attention mechanism named HyperAttention to address the computational challenges posed by the growing complexity of long contexts used in Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent work suggests that in the worst-case scenario, quadratic time is necessary unless the entries of the attention matrix are bounded or the matrix has low stable rank. We introduce two parameters which measure: (1) the max column norm in the normalized attention matrix, and (2) the ratio of row norms in the unnormalized attention matrix after detecting and removing large entries. We use these fine-grained parameters to capture the hardness of the problem. Despite previous lower bounds, we are able to achieve a linear time sampling algorithm even when the matrix has unbounded entries or a large stable rank, provided the above parameters are small. HyperAttention features a modular design that easily accommodates integration of other fast low-level implementations, particularly FlashAttention. Empirically, employing Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) to identify large entries, HyperAttention outperforms existing methods, giving significant speed improvements compared to state-of-the-art solutions like FlashAttention. We validate the empirical performance of HyperAttention on a variety of different long-context length datasets. For example, HyperAttention makes the inference time of ChatGLM2 50\\% faster on 32k context length while perplexity increases from 5.6 to 6.3. On larger context length, e.g., 131k, with causal masking, HyperAttention offers 5-fold speedup on a single attention layer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 3. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention integration*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 4. Contrastive Token-Wise Meta-Learning for Unseen Performer Visual Temporal-Aligned Translation\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Lin Li, Tao Jin, Xize Cheng, Yejin Wang, Wang Lin, Rongjie Huang, Zhou Zhao*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel generalizable framework named C ontrastive To ken-Wise M eta-l earning (CtoML), which strives to transfer recognition skills to unseen performers is developed, and two complementary global and local contrastive losses are developed to maintain inter-class relationships and promote domain-independence.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual temporal-aligned translation aims to transform the visual sequence into natural words, including important applicable tasks such as lipreading and fingerspelling recognition. However, various performance habits of specific words by different speakers or signers can lead to visual ambiguity, which has become a major obstacle to the development of current methods. Considering the constraints above, the generalization ability of the translation system is supposed to be further explored through the evaluation results on unseen per-formers. In this paper, we develop a novel generalizable framework named C ontrastive To ken-Wise M eta-l earning (CtoML), which strives to transfer recognition skills to unseen performers. To the best of our knowledge, employing meta-learning methods directly in the image domain poses two main challenges, and we propose corresponding strategies. First, sequence prediction in visual temporal-aligned translation, which aims to generate multiple words autoregressively, is different from the vanilla classification. Thus, we devise the token-wise diversity-aware weights for the meta-train stage, which encourages the model to make efforts on those ambiguously recognized tokens. Second, considering the consistency of word-visual prototypes across different domains, we develop two complementary global and local contrastive losses to maintain inter-class relationships and promote domain-independence. We conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used lipreading dataset GRID and the fingerspelling dataset ChicagoF-SWild, and the experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed CtoML over existing state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Meta-Learning with Neural Bandit Scheduler\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yunzhe Qi, Yikun Ban, Tianxin Wei, Jiaru Zou, Huaxiu Yao, Jingrui He*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel task scheduling framework under Contextual Bandits settings, named BASS, which directly optimizes the task scheduling strategy based on the status of the meta-model is proposed, which can help tackle the challenge of limited knowledge about the task distribution during the early stage of meta-training.\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning has been proven an effective learning paradigm for training machine learning models with good generalization ability. Apart from the common practice of uniformly sampling the meta-training tasks, existing methods working on task scheduling strategies are mainly based on pre-defined sampling protocols or the assumed task-model correlations, and greedily make scheduling decisions, which can lead to sub-optimal performance bottlenecks of the meta-model. In this paper, we propose a novel task scheduling framework under Contextual Bandits settings, named BASS, which directly optimizes the task scheduling strategy based on the status of the meta-model. By balancing the exploitation and exploration in meta-learning task scheduling, BASS can help tackle the challenge of limited knowledge about the task distribution during the early stage of meta-training, while simultaneously exploring potential benefits for forthcoming meta-training iterations through an adaptive exploration strategy. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments are presented to show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Meta-in-context learning in large language models\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Zeynep Akata, M. Botvinick, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in- context learning itself, and this phenomenon is coined meta-in- Context learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have shown tremendous performance in a variety of tasks. In-context learning -- the ability to improve at a task after being provided with a number of demonstrations -- is seen as one of the main contributors to their success. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in-context learning itself. We coin this phenomenon meta-in-context learning. Looking at two idealized domains, a one-dimensional regression task and a two-armed bandit task, we show that meta-in-context learning adaptively reshapes a large language model's priors over expected tasks. Furthermore, we find that meta-in-context learning modifies the in-context learning strategies of such models. Finally, we extend our approach to a benchmark of real-world regression problems where we observe competitive performance to traditional learning algorithms. Taken together, our work improves our understanding of in-context learning and paves the way toward adapting large language models to the environment they are applied purely through meta-in-context learning rather than traditional finetuning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. 3DILG: Irregular Latent Grids for 3D Generative Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Biao Zhang, M. Nie\u00dfner, Peter Wonka*\n\n**TL;DR:** In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, the shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new representation for encoding 3D shapes as neural fields. The representation is designed to be compatible with the transformer architecture and to benefit both shape reconstruction and shape generation. Existing works on neural fields are grid-based representations with latents defined on a regular grid. In contrast, we define latents on irregular grids, enabling our representation to be sparse and adaptive. In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, our shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. For shape generation, our representation promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models. We show different applications that improve over the current state of the art. First, we show results for probabilistic shape reconstruction from a single higher resolution image. Second, we train a probabilistic model conditioned on very low resolution images. Third, we apply our model to category-conditioned generation. All probabilistic experiments confirm that we are able to generate detailed and high quality shapes to yield the new state of the art in generative 3D shape modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 8. Improved Visual Story Generation with Adaptive Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Zhangyin Feng, Yuchen Ren, Xinmiao Yu, Xiaocheng Feng, Duyu Tang, Shuming Shi, Bing Qin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple method is presented that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models developed on top of powerful text-to-image generation models like Stable Diffusion achieve remarkable success in visual story generation. However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios. We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 9. LayoutPointer: A Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network for Visual Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yongping Xiong, Guibin Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention, and recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE), as a crucial task of Document Intelligence, involves two primary sub-tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition (SER) and Relation Extraction (RE). However, VIE faces two significant challenges. Firstly, most existing models inadequately utilize spatial information of entities, often failing to predict connections or incorrectly linking spatially distant entities. Secondly, the improper input order of tokens challenges in extracting complete entity pairs from documents with multi-line entities when text is extracted via PDF parser or OCR. To address these challenges, we propose LayoutPointer, a Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network. LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention. Furthermore, we recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities. To better evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we reconstruct a multi-line dataset named MLFUD, which more accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Fine-tuning experimental results on FUNSD, XFUND, and MLFUD datasets demonstrate that LayoutPointer significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in F1 scores for RE tasks (e.g., 5.71% improvement on XFUND using LayoutPointer_{\\text{BASE-X}} over LayoutLMv3).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Agent Attention: On the Integration of Softmax and Linear Attention\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention integration*\n\n*Gao Huang, Pengfei Wan, Siyuan Pan, Shiji Song, Zhuofan Xia, Yizeng Han, Tianzhu Ye, Dongchen Han*\n\n**Abstract:** The attention module is the key component in Transformers. While the global attention mechanism offers high expressiveness, its excessive computational cost restricts its applicability in various scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel attention paradigm, Agent Attention, to strike a favorable balance between computational efficiency and representation power. Specifically, the Agent Attention, denoted as a quadruple $(Q, A, K, V)$, introduces an additional set of agent tokens $A$ into the conventional attention module. The agent tokens first act as the agent for the query tokens $Q$ to aggregate information from $K$ and $V$, and then broadcast the information back to $Q$. Given the number of agent tokens can be designed to be much smaller than the number of query tokens, the agent attention is significantly more efficient than the widely adopted Softmax attention, while preserving global context modelling capability. Interestingly, we show that the proposed agent attention is equivalent to a generalized form of linear attention. Therefore, agent attention seamlessly integrates the powerful Softmax attention and the highly efficient linear attention. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of agent attention with various vision Transformers and across diverse vision tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and image generation. Notably, agent attention has shown remarkable performance in high-resolution scenarios, owning to its linear attention nature. For instance, when applied to Stable Diffusion, our agent attention accelerates generation and substantially enhances image generation quality without any additional training.

RoFormer: Enhanced Transformer with Rotary Position Embedding\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention integration*\n\n*Ahmed Murtadha, Yunfeng Liu, Bo Wen, Shengfeng Pan, Yu Lu, Jianlin Su*\n\n**Abstract:** Position encoding recently has shown effective in the transformer architecture. It enables valuable supervision for dependency modeling between elements at different positions of the sequence. In this paper, we first investigate various methods to integrate positional information into the learning process of transformer-based language models. Then, we propose a novel method named Rotary Position Embedding(RoPE) to effectively leverage the positional information. Specifically, the proposed RoPE encodes the absolute position with a rotation matrix and meanwhile incorporates the explicit relative position dependency in self-attention formulation. Notably, RoPE enables valuable properties, including the flexibility of sequence length, decaying inter-token dependency with increasing relative distances, and the capability of equipping the linear self-attention with relative position encoding. Finally, we evaluate the enhanced transformer with rotary position embedding, also called RoFormer, on various long text classification benchmark datasets. Our experiments show that it consistently overcomes its alternatives. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical analysis to explain some experimental results. RoFormer is already integrated into Huggingface: \\url{https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roformer}.\n\n**Published:** 2021-04-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. Meta-Reinforcement Learning of Structured Exploration Strategies\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yuxuan Liu, Russell Mendonca, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Abhishek Gupta*\n\n**Abstract:** Exploration is a fundamental challenge in reinforcement learning (RL). Many\nof the current exploration methods for deep RL use task-agnostic objectives,\nsuch as information gain or bonuses based on state visitation. However, many\npractical applications of RL involve learning more than a single task, and\nprior tasks can be used to inform how exploration should be performed in new\ntasks. In this work, we explore how prior tasks can inform an agent about how\nto explore effectively in new situations. We introduce a novel gradient-based\nfast adaptation algorithm -- model agnostic exploration with structured noise\n(MAESN) -- to learn exploration strategies from prior experience. The prior\nexperience is used both to initialize a policy and to acquire a latent\nexploration space that can inject structured stochasticity into a policy,\nproducing exploration strategies that are informed by prior knowledge and are\nmore effective than random action-space noise. We show that MAESN is more\neffective at learning exploration strategies when compared to prior meta-RL\nmethods, RL without learned exploration strategies, and task-agnostic\nexploration methods. We evaluate our method on a variety of simulated tasks:\nlocomotion with a wheeled robot, locomotion with a quadrupedal walker, and\nobject manipulation.\n\n**Conference:** meta-reinforcement-learning-of-structured-1\n\n**Published:** 2018-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning Fast Adaptation with Meta Strategy Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning strategies*\n\n*Yunfei Bai, Sehoon Ha, Erwin Coumans, Wenhao Yu, Jie Tan*\n\n**Abstract:** The ability to walk in new scenarios is a key milestone on the path toward real-world applications of legged robots. In this work, we introduce Meta Strategy Optimization, a meta-learning algorithm for training policies with latent variable inputs that can quickly adapt to new scenarios with a handful of trials in the target environment. The key idea behind MSO is to expose the same adaptation process, Strategy Optimization (SO), to both the training and testing phases. This allows MSO to effectively learn locomotion skills as well as a latent space that is suitable for fast adaptation. We evaluate our method on a real quadruped robot and demonstrate successful adaptation in various scenarios, including sim-to-real transfer, walking with a weakened motor, or climbing up a slope. Furthermore, we quantitatively analyze the generalization capability of the trained policy in simulated environments. Both real and simulated experiments show that our method outperforms previous methods in adaptation to novel tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-28\n\n\n\n#### 5. Residual Learning and Context Encoding for Adaptive Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Joni Pajarinen, Aidan Scannell, Mohammadreza Nakhaei*\n\n**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning sequential behavior from fixed datasets. Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations, many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance. In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications, such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover, the dynamics may vary during the online fine-tuning. To address this problem of changing dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support dynamics' changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way, whilst comparison methods cannot.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*John Wieting, Iulia Turc, Dan Garrette, Jonathan H. Clark*\n\n**Abstract:** Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 2.8 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having 28% fewer model parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating meta-learning strategies, linear attention mechanisms, and context-adaptive encoding, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided sources and additional analysis:\n\n## Linear Attention Integration\n- The **Taipan** architecture introduced in the paper combines selective attention and sliding window attention, which allows for efficient processing of long sequences while capturing long-range dependencies. This approach reduces the computational complexity by producing a sparser attention weight map, making it suitable for handling theoretically unlimited context lengths during inference.\n- **Hedgehog Linear Attention** and **Lightning Attention**, as mentioned in the analysis, offer methods to integrate linear attention into existing architectures. Hedgehog Linear Attention uses trainable MLPs to mimic softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity, and Lightning Attention divides attention calculations into intra-blocks and inter-blocks to handle unlimited sequence lengths efficiently.\n\n## Meta-Learning Strategies\n- The **CASAK-V** approach described in leverages a meta-learning framework to fine-tune a compact pre-trained vision-language encoder-decoder transformer. This method dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns and implements adaptive chunk-wise KV-cache compression. This dynamic adaptation enhances the model's efficiency and adaptability, particularly in long-context processing.\n- Meta-learning strategies can be integrated to enhance the model's ability to adapt to new tasks and contexts. For instance, the use of a meta-learning framework in CASAK-V allows the model to learn sparse attention patterns and compression policies that are context-aware and task-specific.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n- **CASAK-V** also incorporates a context-aware adaptive sparse attention mechanism, which dynamically generates attention masks based on previous attention logits and the input sequence. This approach ensures that the model remains context-aware and can adapt to different input sequences and tasks.\n- The **Taipan** architecture removes positional embeddings from the attention module, which improves the model's extrapolation capabilities and allows it to better generalize temporal relationships. This is another example of context-adaptive encoding, where the model adjusts its attention mechanism based on the input context.\n\n## Practical Challenges and Future Directions\n- Integrating linear attention mechanisms into existing Transformer architectures requires careful consideration to maintain performance while reducing complexity. The **Hedgehog** and **Lightning Attention** methods provide insights into how this can be achieved by mimicking softmax attention or dividing attention calculations.\n- Exploring additional meta-learning strategies, such as those used in CASAK-V, can further enhance the model's adaptability. This includes using meta-learning to fine-tune the model for specific tasks or contexts, which can improve robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Summary\nBy integrating linear attention mechanisms like Taipan, Hedgehog Linear Attention, and Lightning Attention, and leveraging meta-learning strategies such as those in CASAK-V, researchers can significantly enhance the efficiency, scalability, and robustness of autoregressive language models. These approaches allow for dynamic adaptation to different contexts and sequence lengths, reducing computational complexity while maintaining or improving performance.\n",

CAPE: Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding for Length Extrapolation (Avg.

Prior research has introduced absolute positional encoding (APE) and relative positional encoding (RPE) to distinguish token positions in given sequences. However, both APE and RPE remain fixed after model training regardless of input data, limiting their adaptability and flexibility. Hence, we expect that the desired positional encoding should be context-adaptive and can be dynamically adjusted with the given attention. In this paper, we propose a Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE) method, which dynamically and semantically adjusts based on input context and learned fixed priors. Experimental validation on real-world datasets (Arxiv, Books3, and CHE) demonstrates that CAPE enhances model performances in terms of trained length and length generalization, where the improvements are statistically significant. The model visualization suggests that our model can keep both local and anti-local information. Finally, we successfully train the model on sequence length 128 and achieve better performance at evaluation sequence length 8192, compared with other static positional encoding methods, revealing the benefit of the adaptive positional encoding method.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/29 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 32, 2019.

Meier-Hellstern*\n\n**Published in:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics (2024)\t**Cited by** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel framework, called Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE), is introduced to enable existing LLMs to perform ICL with an increased number of demonstrations by significantly expanding their context size, all the while preserving linear efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising in-context learning abilities. However, conventional In-Context Learning (ICL) approaches are often impeded by length limitations of transformer architecture, which pose challenges when attempting to effectively integrate supervision from a substantial number of demonstration examples. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework, called Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE), to enable existing LLMs to perform ICL with an increased number of demonstrations by significantly expanding their context size. Importantly, this expansion does not require fine-tuning or dependence on particular model architectures, all the while preserving linear efficiency. NBCE initially splits the context into equal-sized windows fitting the target LLM\u2019s maximum length. Then, it introduces a voting mechanism to select the most relevant window, regarded as the posterior context. Finally, it employs Bayes\u2019 theorem to generate the test task. Our experimental results demonstrate that NBCE substantially enhances performance, particularly as the number of demonstration examples increases, consistently outperforming alternative methods. The NBCE code will be made publicly accessible. The code NBCE is available at: https://github.com/amurtadha/NBCE-master\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/33 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nHowever, these approaches require additional training over several steps, which can be time-consuming. Recently, Hao et al. (2022) introduced structured prompting, encoding demonstrations with specific position embeddings for collective attention via a scaled mechanism. Extending this, Ratner et al. (2023) proposed parallel context windows, utilizing individual encoding of examples with designed position and attention mechanisms. Addressing this issue is crucial for leveraging ICL effectively, especially in scenarios with ample examples. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework called Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE) for large language models to significantly expand the number of demonstrations by orders of magnitude while greatly enhancing stability. Instead of simply merging all demonstrations, we partition the vast number of demonstrations into multiple groups, each independently processed by the language model. This approach ensures that the encoding complexity scales linearly with the number of groups, avoiding the quadratic complexity associated with considering all examples simultaneously. Following Ratner et al. (2023); Hao\net al. (2022), we align the position embeddings of grouped prompts to the right, placing them next to the test input. Subsequently, we leverage the Naive Bayes to encode the input by conditioning it on these grouped prompts. We conducted experiments across various tasks, including text classification, multi-choice, and open-ended tasks. NBCE effectively scales up the number of demonstrations, outperforming conventional in-context learning across different model sizes and tasks, while also significantly enhancing stability. In brief, the contributions can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. We introduce an innovative framework known as Naive Bayes-based Context Extension (NBCE), designed to substantially increase the volume of demonstrations for large language models, thus enhancing stability on a significant scale. 2. We provide detailed technical insights to enable context expending of in-context learning tasks. The idea is to encode the test sample by conditioning it on a vast array of demonstrations sourced from the training dataset. 3. We conducted extensive experiments on benchmark NLP datasets, and our findings clearly highlight NBCE's remarkable capability to efficiently scale up the number of demonstrations, while significantly enhancing overall stability. ## 2 Approach\n\nAn example of our proposed NBCE is depicted in 1. Assume that we have a sequence, denoted as $T$, which we intend to generate. Furthermore, we have multiple relatively independent context sets, denoted as $S_{1}, S_{2}, \\ldots, S_{n}$ (e.g., $n$ different paragraphs), each of which is sufficiently long and does not split a sentence into fragments. Suppose that the total length of these context sets exceeds the training length, but when combined with an individual $S_{k}$ and $T$, they still fall within the training length.\n```\n\n#### 3. XL3M: A Training-free Framework for LLM Length Extension Based on Segment-wise Inference (Avg.

To address this problem, the existing methods either require substantial costs or introduce precision loss. In this paper, we empirically find that the accuracy of the LLM's prediction is highly correlated to its certainty. Based on this, we propose an efficient training free framework, named XL3M (it means extra-long large language model), which enables the LLMs trained on short sequences to reason extremely long sequence without any further training or fine-tuning. Under the XL3M framework, the input context will be firstly decomposed into multiple short sub-contexts, where each sub-context contains an independent segment and a common ``question'' which is a few tokens from the end of the original context. Then XL3M gives a method to measure the relevance between each segment and the ``question'', and constructs a concise key context by splicing all the relevant segments in chronological order. The key context is further used instead of the original context to complete the inference task. Evaluations on comprehensive benchmarks show the superiority of XL3M. Using our framework, a Llama2-7B model is able to reason 20M long sequences on an 8-card Huawei Ascend 910B NPU machine with 64GB memory per card.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/19 (Score: 0.07)*\n\n```\nAdvances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36, 2024.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/30 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\n# Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers \n\nSotiris Anagnostidis ${ }^{\\mu} \\quad$ Dario Pavllo $^{\\mu} \\quad$ Luca Biggio $^{\\mu, \\nu} \\quad$ Lorenzo Noci $^{\\mu}$\n\nAurelien Lucchi ${ }^{\\tau} \\quad$ Thomas Hofmann ${ }^{\\mu}$<br>${ }^{\\mu}$ ETH Z\u00fcrich<br>${ }^{\\nu}$ ML, CSEM SA<br>${ }^{\\tau}$ University of Basel\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAutoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences.\n```\n\n#### 5. Hungry Hungry Hippos: Towards Language Modeling with State Space Models (Avg. Score: 0.02)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Khaled Kamal Saab, A. Thomas, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2022)\t**Cited by** 200  (*Influential: 18*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A new SSM layer, H3, is proposed that is explicitly designed for the impact on language modeling and achieves promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have demonstrated state-of-the-art sequence modeling performance in some modalities, but underperform attention in language modeling. Moreover, despite scaling nearly linearly in sequence length instead of quadratically, SSMs are still slower than Transformers due to poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/49 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\nGovernment.

Meta-Learning Online Adaptation of Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning adaptation*\n\n*Nathan J. Hu, E. Mitchell, Christopher D. Manning, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models encode impressively broad world knowledge in their parameters. However, the knowledge in static language models falls out of date, limiting the model's effective\"shelf life.\"While online fine-tuning can reduce this degradation, we find that naively fine-tuning on a stream of documents leads to a low level of information uptake. We hypothesize that online fine-tuning does not sufficiently attend to important information. That is, the gradient signal from important tokens representing factual information is drowned out by the gradient from inherently noisy tokens, suggesting that a dynamic, context-aware learning rate may be beneficial. We therefore propose learning which tokens to upweight. We meta-train a small, autoregressive model to reweight the language modeling loss for each token during online fine-tuning, with the objective of maximizing the out-of-date base question-answering model's ability to answer questions about a document after a single weighted gradient step. We call this approach Context-aware Meta-learned Loss Scaling (CaMeLS). Across three different distributions of documents, our experiments find that CaMeLS provides substantially improved information uptake on streams of thousands of documents compared with standard fine-tuning and baseline heuristics for reweighting token losses.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Meta-SAGE: Scale Meta-Learning Scheduled Adaptation with Guided Exploration for Mitigating Scale Shift on Combinatorial Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning adaptation*\n\n*Jiwoo Son, Minsu Kim, Hyeon-Seob Kim, Jinkyoo Park*\n\n**TL;DR:** Results show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative CO tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** This paper proposes Meta-SAGE, a novel approach for improving the scalability of deep reinforcement learning models for combinatorial optimization (CO) tasks. Our method adapts pre-trained models to larger-scale problems in test time by suggesting two components: a scale meta-learner (SML) and scheduled adaptation with guided exploration (SAGE). First, SML transforms the context embedding for subsequent adaptation of SAGE based on scale information. Then, SAGE adjusts the model parameters dedicated to the context embedding for a specific instance. SAGE introduces locality bias, which encourages selecting nearby locations to determine the next location. The locality bias gradually decays as the model is adapted to the target instance. Results show that Meta-SAGE outperforms previous adaptation methods and significantly improves scalability in representative CO tasks.

Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Rethinking Attention with Performers\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*K.

Colwell, Adrian Weller*\n\n**TL;DR:** Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness are introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce Performers, Transformer architectures which can estimate regular (softmax) full-rank-attention Transformers with provable accuracy, but using only linear (as opposed to quadratic) space and time complexity, without relying on any priors such as sparsity or low-rankness. To approximate softmax attention-kernels, Performers use a novel Fast Attention Via positive Orthogonal Random features approach (FAVOR+), which may be of independent interest for scalable kernel methods. FAVOR+ can be also used to efficiently model kernelizable attention mechanisms beyond softmax. This representational power is crucial to accurately compare softmax with other kernels for the first time on large-scale tasks, beyond the reach of regular Transformers, and investigate optimal attention-kernels. Performers are linear architectures fully compatible with regular Transformers and with strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased or nearly-unbiased estimation of the attention matrix, uniform convergence and low estimation variance. We tested Performers on a rich set of tasks stretching from pixel-prediction through text models to protein sequence modeling. We demonstrate competitive results with other examined efficient sparse and dense attention methods, showcasing effectiveness of the novel attention-learning paradigm leveraged by Performers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 1314  (*Influential: 183*)\n\n#### 5. Efficient Attention via Control Variates\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. 3DILG: Irregular Latent Grids for 3D Generative Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Biao Zhang, M. Nie\u00dfner, Peter Wonka*\n\n**TL;DR:** In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, the shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy and promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a new representation for encoding 3D shapes as neural fields. The representation is designed to be compatible with the transformer architecture and to benefit both shape reconstruction and shape generation. Existing works on neural fields are grid-based representations with latents defined on a regular grid. In contrast, we define latents on irregular grids, enabling our representation to be sparse and adaptive. In the context of shape reconstruction from point clouds, our shape representation built on irregular grids improves upon grid-based methods in terms of reconstruction accuracy. For shape generation, our representation promotes high-quality shape generation using auto-regressive probabilistic models. We show different applications that improve over the current state of the art. First, we show results for probabilistic shape reconstruction from a single higher resolution image. Second, we train a probabilistic model conditioned on very low resolution images. Third, we apply our model to category-conditioned generation. All probabilistic experiments confirm that we are able to generate detailed and high quality shapes to yield the new state of the art in generative 3D shape modeling.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 67  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 7. Improved Visual Story Generation with Adaptive Context Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Zhangyin Feng, Yuchen Ren, Xinmiao Yu, Xiaocheng Feng, Duyu Tang, Shuming Shi, Bing Qin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple method is presented that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story.\n\n**Abstract:** Diffusion models developed on top of powerful text-to-image generation models like Stable Diffusion achieve remarkable success in visual story generation. However, the best-performing approach considers historically generated results as flattened memory cells, ignoring the fact that not all preceding images contribute equally to the generation of the characters and scenes at the current stage. To address this, we present a simple method that improves the leading system with adaptive context modeling, which is not only incorporated in the encoder but also adopted as additional guidance in the sampling stage to boost the global consistency of the generated story. We evaluate our model on PororoSV and FlintstonesSV datasets and show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on both story visualization and continuation scenarios. We conduct detailed model analysis and show that our model excels at generating semantically consistent images for stories.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. LayoutPointer: A Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network for Visual Information Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Siyuan Huang, Yongping Xiong, Guibin Wu*\n\n**TL;DR:** LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention, and recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities.\n\n**Abstract:** Visual Information Extraction (VIE), as a crucial task of Document Intelligence, involves two primary sub-tasks: Semantic Entity Recognition (SER) and Relation Extraction (RE). However, VIE faces two significant challenges. Firstly, most existing models inadequately utilize spatial information of entities, often failing to predict connections or incorrectly linking spatially distant entities. Secondly, the improper input order of tokens challenges in extracting complete entity pairs from documents with multi-line entities when text is extracted via PDF parser or OCR. To address these challenges, we propose LayoutPointer, a Spatial-Context Adaptive Pointer Network. LayoutPointer explicitly enhances spatial-context relationships by incorporating 2D relative position information and adaptive spatial constraints within self-attention. Furthermore, we recast the RE task as a specialized cycle detection problem, employing a unique tail-to-head pointer to restore the semantic order among multi-line entities. To better evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed method, we reconstruct a multi-line dataset named MLFUD, which more accurately reflects real-world scenarios. Fine-tuning experimental results on FUNSD, XFUND, and MLFUD datasets demonstrate that LayoutPointer significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in F1 scores for RE tasks (e.g., 5.71% improvement on XFUND using LayoutPointer_{\\text{BASE-X}} over LayoutLMv3).\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 2 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. PermuteFormer: Efficient Relative Position Encoding for Long Sequences\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Peng Chen*\n\n**Abstract:** A recent variation of Transformer, Performer, scales Transformer to longer\nsequences with a linear attention mechanism. However, it is not compatible with\nrelative position encoding, which has advantages over absolute position\nencoding. In this paper, we discuss possible ways to add relative position\nencoding to Performer. Based on the analysis, we propose PermuteFormer, a\nPerformer-based model with relative position encoding that scales linearly on\nlong sequences. PermuteFormer applies position-dependent transformation on\nqueries and keys to encode positional information into the attention module.\nThis transformation is carefully crafted so that the final output of\nself-attention is not affected by absolute positions of tokens. PermuteFormer\nintroduces negligible computational overhead by design that it runs as fast as\nPerformer. We evaluate PermuteFormer on Long-Range Arena, a dataset for long\nsequences, as well as WikiText-103, a language modeling dataset. The\nexperiments show that PermuteFormer uniformly improves the performance of\nPerformer with almost no computational overhead and outperforms vanilla\nTransformer on most of the tasks.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-06T11:49:22Z  (*Updated: 2021-09-08T13:17:49Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning for Fast Adaptation of Deep Networks\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning adaptation*\n\n*Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine, Chelsea Finn*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm for meta-learning that is model-agnostic, in the\nsense that it is compatible with any model trained with gradient descent and\napplicable to a variety of different learning problems, including\nclassification, regression, and reinforcement learning. The goal of\nmeta-learning is to train a model on a variety of learning tasks, such that it\ncan solve new learning tasks using only a small number of training samples. In\nour approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a\nsmall number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new\ntask will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our\nmethod trains the model to be easy to fine-tune. We demonstrate that this\napproach leads to state-of-the-art performance on two few-shot image\nclassification benchmarks, produces good results on few-shot regression, and\naccelerates fine-tuning for policy gradient reinforcement learning with neural\nnetwork policies.\n\n**Conference:** model-agnostic-meta-learning-for-fast-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-03-09\n\n\n\n#### 2. Decoupling Adaptation from Modeling with Meta-Optimizers for Meta Learning\n\n*From Search Query: meta-learning adaptation*\n\n*Fei Sha, Shariq Iqbal, S\u00e9bastien M.R. Arnold*\n\n**Abstract:** Meta-learning methods, most notably Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (Finn et al, 2017) or MAML, have achieved great success in adapting to new tasks quickly, after having been trained on similar tasks.\nThe mechanism behind their success, however, is poorly understood.\nWe begin this work with an experimental analysis of MAML, finding that deep models are crucial for its success, even given sets of simple tasks where a linear model would suffice on any individual task.\nFurthermore, on image-recognition tasks, we find that the early layers of MAML-trained models learn task-invariant features, while later layers are used for adaptation, providing further evidence that these models require greater capacity than is strictly necessary for their individual tasks.\nFollowing our findings, we propose a method which enables better use of model capacity at inference time by separating the adaptation aspect of meta-learning into parameters that are only used for adaptation but are not part of the forward model.\nWe find that our approach enables more effective meta-learning in smaller models, which are suitably sized for the individual tasks.\n\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-25\n\n\n\n#### 3. Linear Complexity Randomized Self-attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: linear attention mechanisms*\n\n*Lingpeng Kong, Chong Wang, Lin Zheng*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, random feature attentions (RFAs) are proposed to approximate the softmax attention in linear time and space complexity by linearizing the exponential kernel. In this paper, we first propose a novel perspective to understand the bias in such approximation by recasting RFAs as self-normalized importance samplers. This perspective further sheds light on an \\emph{unbiased} estimator for the whole softmax attention, called randomized attention (RA). RA constructs positive random features via query-specific distributions and enjoys greatly improved approximation fidelity, albeit exhibiting quadratic complexity. By combining the expressiveness in RA and the efficiency in RFA, we develop a novel linear complexity self-attention mechanism called linear randomized attention (LARA). Extensive experiments across various domains demonstrate that RA and LARA significantly improve the performance of RFAs by a substantial margin.\n\n**Published:** 2022-04-10\n\n\n\n#### 4.

Residual Learning and Context Encoding for Adaptive Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*Joni Pajarinen, Aidan Scannell, Mohammadreza Nakhaei*\n\n**Abstract:** Offline reinforcement learning (RL) allows learning sequential behavior from fixed datasets. Since offline datasets do not cover all possible situations, many methods collect additional data during online fine-tuning to improve performance. In general, these methods assume that the transition dynamics remain the same during both the offline and online phases of training. However, in many real-world applications, such as outdoor construction and navigation over rough terrain, it is common for the transition dynamics to vary between the offline and online phases. Moreover, the dynamics may vary during the online fine-tuning. To address this problem of changing dynamics from offline to online RL we propose a residual learning approach that infers dynamics changes to correct the outputs of the offline solution. At the online fine-tuning phase, we train a context encoder to learn a representation that is consistent inside the current online learning environment while being able to predict dynamic transitions. Experiments in D4RL MuJoCo environments, modified to support dynamics' changes upon environment resets, show that our approach can adapt to these dynamic changes and generalize to unseen perturbations in a sample-efficient way, whilst comparison methods cannot.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 6. CANINE: Pre-training an Efficient Tokenization-Free Encoder for Language Representation\n\n*From Search Query: context-adaptive encoding*\n\n*John Wieting, Iulia Turc, Dan Garrette, Jonathan H. Clark*\n\n**Abstract:** Pipelined NLP systems have largely been superseded by end-to-end neural modeling, yet nearly all commonly-used models still require an explicit tokenization step. While recent tokenization approaches based on data-derived subword lexicons are less brittle than manually engineered tokenizers, these techniques are not equally suited to all languages, and the use of any fixed vocabulary may limit a model's ability to adapt. In this paper, we present CANINE, a neural encoder that operates directly on character sequences, without explicit tokenization or vocabulary, and a pre-training strategy that operates either directly on characters or optionally uses subwords as a soft inductive bias. To use its finer-grained input effectively and efficiently, CANINE combines downsampling, which reduces the input sequence length, with a deep transformer stack, which encodes context. CANINE outperforms a comparable mBERT model by 2.8 F1 on TyDi QA, a challenging multilingual benchmark, despite having 28% fewer model parameters.\n\n**Published:** 2021-03-11\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating meta-learning, linear attention mechanisms, and context-adaptive encoding, here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided references and additional analysis:\n\n## Meta-Learning Adaptation\n- **Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning**: This approach, as seen in the context of reinforcement learning and few-shot learning, can be adapted for language models. For instance, model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) allows the model to quickly adapt to new tasks with minimal training, which is crucial for enhancing the adaptability of language models.\n  - In the context of language models, meta-learning can be used to train the model on a variety of tasks, enabling it to generalize better across different contexts. This is similar to the concept of training meta-learner agents in distributed environments, as described in the MAML-DRL algorithm.\n\n## Linear Attention Mechanisms\n- **HyperAttention**: This mechanism allows for long-context attention in near-linear time, addressing the computational challenges associated with long sequences. Integrating such mechanisms can significantly reduce the computational complexity of autoregressive models, making them more efficient for handling long contexts *HyperAttention reference*.\n  - Similarly, **Agent Attention** combines softmax and linear attention, providing a balance between computational efficiency and representation power. This could be particularly useful for enhancing the attention mechanisms in language models without compromising performance *Agent Attention reference*.\n- **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)**: Although not specifically mentioned in the provided references, GQA is another linear attention mechanism used in state-of-the-art models like LLaMA3. It reduces the number of K-, V-heads, resulting in lower FLOPs and improved memory bandwidth utilization, which can be beneficial for autoregressive models.\n\n## Context-Adaptive Encoding\n- **Contextual Bandits and Task Scheduling**: Using a task scheduling framework under Contextual Bandits settings can help in dynamically adjusting the model to new tasks and contexts. This approach can enhance the model's adaptability and generalization across varied input contexts *Meta-Learning with Neural Bandit Scheduler reference*.\n  - **Contrastive Token-Wise Meta-Learning**: This framework focuses on transferring recognition skills to unseen contexts, which can be adapted for language models to improve their generalization across different contexts. This method can be integrated into the encoding process to make the model more context-adaptive *Contrastive Token-Wise Meta-Learning reference*.\n- **Adaptive Layer Norm Blocks**: Incorporating adaptive layer norm blocks, as seen in the Movie Gen model, can help in incorporating time-step information into the Transformer architecture. This can be beneficial for context-adaptive encoding in autoregressive models, allowing them to better handle varying sequence lengths and contexts.\n\n## Practical Considerations and Future Directions\n- **Integration Challenges**: When integrating linear attention mechanisms into existing Transformer architectures, it is crucial to maintain performance while reducing computational complexity. This might involve careful tuning of hyperparameters and ensuring that the attention mechanisms do not compromise the model's representation power *HyperAttention and Agent Attention references*.\n- **Scalability and Adaptability**: Meta-learning strategies should be designed to scale with the model size and the diversity of tasks. Ensuring that the meta-model can efficiently update its parameters based on the insights from various tasks can enhance the model's scalability and adaptability.\n\nBy combining these elements, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are more efficient, scalable, and robust across varied input contexts. The integration of meta-learning for adaptability, linear attention mechanisms for efficiency, and context-adaptive encoding for generalization will be key to achieving these goals.\n",

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/28 (Score: 0.86)*\n\n```\nPappas, and F.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415.

Score: 0.81)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms. The source code is available at https://github.com/OpenNLPLab/lightning-attention.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/25 (Score: 0.81)*\n\n```\nMultiple methods have been proposed to replace the softmax operation. For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n#### 5.

In this paper, we focus on length extrapolation, i.e., training on short texts while evaluating longer sequences. We define attention resolution as an indicator of extrapolation. Then we propose two designs to improve the above metric of Transformers. Specifically, we introduce a relative position embedding to explicitly maximize attention resolution. Moreover, we use blockwise causal attention during inference for better resolution. We evaluate different Transformer variants with language modeling.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

This\nholds exciting promise for (1) training linear Transformers from scratch, (2)\n\"finetuned-conversion\" of task-specific Transformers into linear versions that\nrecover task performance, and (3) \"pretrained-conversion\" of Transformers such\nas large language models into linear versions finetunable on downstream tasks.\nHowever, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in\nquality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack\nkey properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or\n\"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly\nsimple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance,\nbut are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a\nlearnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of\nsoftmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple\ntrainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention.\nExperiments show Hedgehog recovers over 99% of standard Transformer quality in\ntrain-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior\nlinear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs,\nand up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs.

As such, that learner must adapt to\nthe context without additional training. We explore the role of softmax\nattention in an ICL setting where each context encodes a regression task.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Synergistic Integration of Linear Attention and Meta-Learning:**\n  \n  The ALA proposal's combination of linear attention mechanisms with meta-learning strategies aligns with ongoing research trends aiming to enhance efficiency and adaptability in language models. For instance, **Fast Weight Layers (FWLs)** in **\"Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models\"** demonstrate how meta-learning can dynamically adjust attention weights efficiently, improving perplexity without incurring significant computational overhead. Similarly, **\"Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners\"** suggests that transformers can function as meta-learners, further supporting ALA's approach.\n\n- **Context-Adaptive Encoding Enhancements:**\n  \n  Techniques like **Context-Adaptive Positional Encoding (CAPE)** introduced in **\"One Meta-tuned Transformer is What You Need for Few-shot Learning\"** and **Infini-attention** from internal sources showcase the advantages of dynamically adjusting positional encodings based on input context. ALA's context-adaptive encoding could similarly enhance the model's ability to generalize across varied contexts, ensuring that attention mechanisms remain relevant and effective regardless of input variations.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability Benchmarking:**\n  \n  Internal studies such as **\"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding\"** and external works like **\"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine: Expressive Linear Attentions with Softmax Mimicry\"** reveal substantial efficiency gains through augmented linear attention mechanisms. ALA's goal to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear aligns with these findings, potentially enabling scalable models capable of handling longer sequences without sacrificing performance.\n\n- **Empirical Performance Benchmarks:**\n  \n  Empirical validations from papers like **\"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding\"** and **\"MosaicBERT\"** demonstrate significant improvements in perplexity and generation speed. ALA's proposed augmentation techniques, inspired by these studies, suggest that similar or enhanced performance gains are achievable. However, ALA must clearly distinguish its unique contributions to avoid overlapping with these existing methodologies.\n\n- **Training Stability and Optimization:**\n  \n  Integrating meta-learning into attention mechanisms introduces complexities related to training stability and optimization. Insights from **\"Training Dynamics of Transformers to Recognize Word Co-occurrence via Gradient Flow Analysis\"** indicate that maintaining balanced gradient flows is crucial for stable training. ALA must ensure that its meta-learning framework preserves gradient stability to prevent issues like vanishing or exploding gradients, which can adversely affect model performance.\n\n- **Potential Overlaps and Differentiation:**\n  \n  While ALA's integration of linear attention with meta-learning is promising, there are existing models like **AFT (Attention Free Transformer)** and **Infini-attention** that incorporate similar elements. To establish novelty, ALA must highlight unique aspects such as specific meta-learning algorithms employed, novel augmentation techniques, or distinct context-adaptive encoding strategies that set it apart from these models.\n\n- **Robustness and Generalization:**\n  \n  By dynamically adjusting attention weights and encoding based on input context, ALA is poised to enhance model robustness and generalization. External sources like **\"Why Can GPT Learn In-Context?\"** provide evidence that meta-learning can significantly improve in-context learning capabilities, suggesting that ALA's approach could yield similar benefits across diverse language tasks and varying input lengths.\n\n**4. Future Search Plan or Plan of Next Steps:**\n\nWhile the current analysis provides substantial insights into the ALA proposal's alignment with existing research, further exploration is warranted to ensure comprehensive coverage and validate the proposal's uniqueness. The following search strategies are recommended for the next round:\n\n- **External Source Search Keywords:**\n  \n  ```keywords\n  \"meta-learning adaptive attention transformers\" \"dynamic context encoding language models\" \"advanced linear attention meta-learning integration\" \"context-aware meta-learning attention\" \"adaptive linear transformers meta-learning\"\n  ```\n\n- **Internal Library Search Description:**\n  \n  ```description\n  Find research papers and technical documents that delve into advanced integrations of meta-learning strategies with adaptive linear attention mechanisms specifically designed for autoregressive language models.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg. Score: 0.97)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

For instance, Katharopoulos et al. (2020a) employ the $1+$ elu activation function, Qin et al. (2022b) utilize the cosine function to approximate softmax properties, and Ke et al. (2021); Zheng et al. (2022; 2023) leverage sampling strategies to directly mimic softmax operation. Despite having a theoretical complexity of $O\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$, the practical computational efficiency of linear attention diminishes notably in causal attention scenarios, primarily due to the necessity for cumsum operations (Hua et al., 2022). ### 2.2. IO-aware Attention\n\nThe FlashAttention series (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) focuses on system-level optimizations for the efficient implementation of the standard attention operator on GPU platforms. Extensive validation has demonstrated its effectiveness. The approach employs tiling strategies to minimize the volume of memory reads/writes between the GPU's high bandwidth memory (HBM) and on-chip SRAM. To address the issue of slow computation for Linear Attention in the causal setting, Lightning Attention 1 (Qin et al., 2023b) employs the approach of FlashAttention-1/2, which involves segmenting the inputs $\\mathbf{Q}, \\mathbf{K}, \\mathbf{V}$ into blocks, transferring them from slow HBM to fast SRAM, and then computing the attention output with respect to these blocks. Subsequently, the final results are accumulated. Although this method is much more efficient than the PyTorch implementation, it does not take advantage of the computational characteristics inherent to Linear Attention, and the theoretical complexity remains $O\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$. ### 2.3. Long Sequence Handling in LLM\n\nA widely adopted strategy to tackle challenges related to length extrapolation involves the integration of Relative Positional Encoding (RPE) techniques (Su et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2023c), strategically directing attention towards neighboring tokens. ALiBi (Press et al., 2022) utilizes linear decay biases in attention mechanisms to mitigate the impact of distant tokens. Roformer (Su et al., 2021) introduces a novel Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) method, widely embraced in the community, effectively leveraging positional information for transformer-based language model learning. Kerple (Chi et al., 2022) explores shift-invariant conditionally positive definite kernels within RPEs, introducing a suite of kernels aimed at enhancing length extrapolation properties, with ALiBi recognized as one of its instances. Furthermore, Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023) postulates a hypothesis elucidating the mechanism behind ALiBi , empirically validating it by incorporating the hypothesis into sinusoidal positional embeddings. (Qin et al., 2024) explored the sufficient conditions for additive relative position encoding to have extrapolation capabilities. Instead of investigating the length extrapolation capability of transformers, some works also attempt to directly increase the context window sizes. Chen et al. (2023) introduces Position Interpolation (PI), extending context window sizes of RoPE-based pretrained Large Language Models (LLMs) such as LLaMA models to up to 32768 with minimal finetuning (within 1000 steps). StreamingLLM (Xiao et al., 2023) proposes leveraging the attention sink phenomenon, maintaining the Key and Value information of initial tokens to substantially recover the performance of window attention.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: adaptive linear attention meta-learning language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Why Can GPT Learn In-Context? Language Models Secretly Perform Gradient Descent as Meta-Optimizers\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention meta-learning language models*\n\n*Damai Dai, Yutao Sun, Li Dong, Y. Hao, Zhifang Sui, Furu Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** Inspired by the understanding of meta-optimization, a momentum-based attention is designed by analogy with the momentum- based gradient descent algorithm and its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports the understanding from another aspect.\n\n**Abstract:** Large pretrained language models have shown surprising In-Context Learning (ICL) ability. With a few demonstration input-label pairs, they can predict the label for an unseen input without additional parameter updates. Despite the great success in performance, the working mechanism of ICL still remains an open problem. In order to better understand how ICL works, this paper explains language models as meta-optimizers and understands ICL as a kind of implicit \ufb01netuning. Theoretically, we \ufb01gure out that the Transformer attention has a dual form of gradient descent based optimization. On top of it, we understand ICL as follows: GPT \ufb01rst produces meta-gradients according to the demonstration examples, and then these meta-gradients are applied to the original GPT to build an ICL model. Experimentally, we comprehensively compare the behavior of ICL and explicit \ufb01netuning based on real tasks to provide empirical evidence that supports our understanding. The results prove that ICL behaves similarly to explicit \ufb01netuning at the prediction level, the representation level, and the attention behavior level. Further, inspired by our understanding of meta-optimization, we design a momentum-based attention by analogy with the momentum-based gradient descent algorithm. Its consistently better performance over vanilla attention supports our understanding again from another aspect, and more impor-tantly, it shows the potential to utilize our understanding for future model designing.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 230  (*Influential: 19*)\n\n#### 3. Forging Multiple Training Objectives for Pre-trained Language Models via Meta-Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention meta-learning language models*\n\n*Hongqiu Wu, Ruixue Ding, Haizhen Zhao, Boli Chen, Pengjun Xie, Fei Huang, Min Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes MOMETAS, a novel adaptive sampler based on meta-learning, which learns the latent sampling pattern on arbitrary pre-training objectives and demonstrates universal performance gain over other rule-based sampling strategies on 14 natural language processing tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Multiple pre-training objectives fill the vacancy of the understanding capability of single-objective language modeling, which serves the ultimate purpose of pre-trained language models (PrLMs), generalizing well on a mass of scenarios. However, learning multiple training objectives in a single model is challenging due to the unknown relative significance as well as the potential contrariety between them. Empirical studies have shown that the current objective sampling in an ad-hoc manual setting makes the learned language representation barely converge to the desired optimum. Thus, we propose \\textit{MOMETAS}, a novel adaptive sampler based on meta-learning, which learns the latent sampling pattern on arbitrary pre-training objectives. Such a design is lightweight with negligible additional training overhead. To validate our approach, we adopt five objectives and conduct continual pre-training with BERT-base and BERT-large models, where MOMETAS demonstrates universal performance gain over other rule-based sampling strategies on 14 natural language processing tasks.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Meta Learning to Bridge Vision and Language Models for Multimodal Few-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention meta-learning language models*\n\n*Ivona Najdenkoska, Xiantong Zhen, M. Worring*\n\n**TL;DR:** The experimental results show that the multimodal meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal few-shot learning is challenging due to the large domain gap between vision and language modalities. Existing methods are trying to communicate visual concepts as prompts to frozen language models, but rely on hand-engineered task induction to reduce the hypothesis space. To make the whole process learnable, we introduce a multimodal meta-learning approach. Specifically, our approach decomposes the training of the model into a set of related multimodal few-shot tasks. We define a meta-mapper network, acting as a meta-learner, to efficiently bridge frozen large-scale vision and language models and leverage their already learned capacity. By updating the learnable parameters only of the meta-mapper, it learns to accrue shared meta-knowledge among these tasks. Thus, it can rapidly adapt to newly presented samples with only a few gradient updates. Importantly, it induces the task in a completely data-driven manner, with no need for a hand-engineered task induction. We evaluate our approach on recently proposed multimodal few-shot benchmarks, measuring how rapidly the model can bind novel visual concepts to words and answer visual questions by observing only a limited set of labeled examples. The experimental results show that our meta-learning approach outperforms the baseline across multiple datasets and various training settings while being computationally more efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Meta-in-context learning in large language models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive linear attention meta-learning language models*\n\n*Julian Coda-Forno, Marcel Binz, Zeynep Akata, M. Botvinick, Jane X. Wang, Eric Schulz*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in- context learning itself, and this phenomenon is coined meta-in- Context learning.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have shown tremendous performance in a variety of tasks. In-context learning -- the ability to improve at a task after being provided with a number of demonstrations -- is seen as one of the main contributors to their success. In the present paper, we demonstrate that the in-context learning abilities of large language models can be recursively improved via in-context learning itself. We coin this phenomenon meta-in-context learning. Looking at two idealized domains, a one-dimensional regression task and a two-armed bandit task, we show that meta-in-context learning adaptively reshapes a large language model's priors over expected tasks. Furthermore, we find that meta-in-context learning modifies the in-context learning strategies of such models. Finally, we extend our approach to a benchmark of real-world regression problems where we observe competitive performance to traditional learning algorithms. Taken together, our work improves our understanding of in-context learning and paves the way toward adapting large language models to the environment they are applied purely through meta-in-context learning rather than traditional finetuning.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing and evaluating the AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA) block for autoregressive language models, here are some key steps and information sources that can be particularly useful:\n\n### 1.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 1/41 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n# When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding: Towards More Effective and Efficient Linearized Large Language Models \n\nHaoran You ${ }^{1}$ Yichao Fu ${ }^{1}$ Zheng Wang ${ }^{1}$ Amir Yazdanbakhsh ${ }^{2}$ Yingyan (Celine) Lin ${ }^{1}$\n\n\n#### Abstract\n\nAutoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in language tasks but face two significant bottlenecks: (1) quadratic complexity in the attention module as the number of tokens increases, and (2) limited efficiency due to the sequential processing nature of autoregressive LLMs during generation.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Although SSMs exhibit competitive performance, their in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, a remarkable emergent property of modern language models that enables task execution without parameter optimization, remain underexplored compared to Transformers. In this study, we evaluate the ICL performance of SSMs, focusing on Mamba, against Transformer models across various tasks. Our results show that SSMs perform comparably to Transformers in standard regression ICL tasks, while outperforming them in tasks like sparse parity learning. However, SSMs fall short in tasks involving non-standard retrieval functionality. To address these limitations, we introduce a hybrid model, MambaFormer, that combines Mamba with attention blocks, surpassing individual models in tasks where they struggle independently. Our findings suggest that hybrid architectures offer promising avenues for enhancing ICL in language models.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/37 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn fact, Ahn et al. (2023); Mahankali et al. (2023) have provably shown that the global minimum of the linear regression ICL objective implements one step of preconditioned gradient descent for one layer of linear attention. While these settings might appear simplistic and detached from language models, Bhattamishra et al. (2023) showed that a frozen GPT-2 can implement the nearest neighbor algorithm, drawing connections between the ICL in existing language models and the stylized setting of training for ICL from random initialization. Furthermore, Olsson et al. (2022) also empirically demonstrate that \"induction heads\", which are attention heads that solve a simple retrieval problem, correlate with ICL behavior, providing a strong connection between retrieval and ICL. Sub-quadratic architectures. The number of effective floating point operations in an attention layer scales quadratically with respect to the input sequence length. Numerous approximations or alternative model architectures have been proposed to overcome the quadratic dependence. These range from approximating attention mechanisms (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) to the development of novel recurrent convolutional models such as structured state-space models (Gu et al., 2022b). S4 (Gu et al., 2022a) is a family of sequence models characterized by a discretized state-space model\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{h}_{t}=\\overline{\\mathbf{A}} \\mathbf{h}_{t-1}+\\overline{\\mathbf{B}} \\mathbf{x}_{t}, y_{t}=\\mathbf{C} \\mathbf{h}_{t}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\mathbf{h}_{t}$ represents the hidden state and $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ are input-independent (transformed) parameters. The recurrence is expressible as a convolution, enabling near-linear complexity using Fast Fourier Transform. Viewed in this framework, Linear Transformers (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), which employ linear attention without softmax, can be seen as a variant of linear SSM. Building upon this concept, H3 (Dao et al., 2022) integrates an S4 with dual gated connections. The recent Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) departs from the standard SSM by introducing a selection mechanism that makes $(\\overline{\\mathbf{A}}, \\overline{\\mathbf{B}}, \\mathbf{C})$ in Equation (1) dependent on the input $\\mathbf{x}_{t}$ allowing input-dependent sequence mixing. There are other notable attention-free models such as Hyena (Poli et al., 2023), RWKV (Peng et al., 2023), RetNet (Sun et al., 2023), and GLA (Yang et al., 2023b). Despite of state-of-the-art performance for models like Mamba, Arora et al. (2023) have demonstrated that subquadratic models still lag behind attention on multi-query recall tasks, which is a generalization of the induction head task (Olsson et al., 2022). In their study, Xie et al. (2021) introduced a synthetic language-based dataset for in-context learning, named GINC, and demonstrated that both transformers and LSTMs (Hochreiter \\& Schmidhuber, 1997) can perform ICL. Notably, LSTMs outperformed transformers in ICL accuracy on GINC, a finding similar to that found in Liu et al.\n```\n\n#### 3. Sparse Attention with Linear Units (Avg.

In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/27 (Score: 0.88)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1606.08415.

Sra*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work makes the first theoretical progress on this question via an analysis of the loss landscape for linear transformers trained over random instances of linear regression, and proves the global minimum of the training objective implements a single iteration of preconditioned gradient descent.\n\n**Abstract:** Several recent works demonstrate that transformers can implement algorithms like gradient descent. By a careful construction of weights, these works show that multiple layers of transformers are expressive enough to simulate iterations of gradient descent. Going beyond the question of expressivity, we ask: Can transformers learn to implement such algorithms by training over random problem instances? To our knowledge, we make the first theoretical progress on this question via an analysis of the loss landscape for linear transformers trained over random instances of linear regression. For a single attention layer, we prove the global minimum of the training objective implements a single iteration of preconditioned gradient descent. Notably, the preconditioning matrix not only adapts to the input distribution but also to the variance induced by data inadequacy. For a transformer with $L$ attention layers, we prove certain critical points of the training objective implement $L$ iterations of preconditioned gradient descent.

One Meta-tuned Transformer is What You Need for Few-shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: \"meta-learning linear attention\" \"adaptive attention mechanisms\" \"dynamic attention weights transformers\"*\n\n*Xuehan Yang, Huaxiu Yao, Ying Wei*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, is designed, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained vision transformers have revolutionized few-shot image classification, and it has been recently demonstrated that the previous common practice of meta-learning in synergy with these pre-trained transformers still holds significance. In this work, we design a new framework centered exclusively on attention mechanisms, called MetaFormer, which extends the vision transformers beyond patch token interactions to encompass relationships between samples and tasks simultaneously for further advancing their downstream task performance. Leveraging the intrinsical property of ViTs in handling local patch relationships, we propose Masked Sample Attention (MSA) to efficiently embed the sample relationships into the network, where an adaptive mask is attached for enhancing task-specific feature consistency and providing flexibility in switching between few-shot learning setups. To encapsulate task relationships while filtering out background noise, Patch-grained Task Attention (PTA) is designed to maintain a dynamic knowledge pool consolidating diverse patterns from historical tasks. MetaFormer demonstrates coherence and compatibility with off-the-shelf pre-trained vision transformers and shows significant improvements in both inductive and transductive few-shot learning scenarios, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by up to 8 . 77% and 6 . 25% on 12 in-domain and 10 cross-domain datasets, respectively.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

In contrast to regular gradient-based learning, ICL is highly interpretable and does not require parameter updates. In this paper, we show that, for linearized transformer networks, ICL can be made explicit and permanent through the inclusion of bias terms. We mathematically demonstrate the equivalence between a model with ICL demonstration prompts and the same model with the additional bias terms. Our algorithm (ICLCA) allows for exact conversion in an inexpensive manner. Existing methods are not exact and require expensive parameter updates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through experiments that show the exact incorporation of ICL tokens into a linear transformer. We further suggest how our method can be adapted to achieve cheap approximate conversion of ICL tokens, even in regular transformer networks that are not linearized. Our experiments on GPT-2 show that, even though the conversion is only approximate, the model still gains valuable context from the included bias terms.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4.

This success is intrinsically related to the capability of handling long sequences and the presence of context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism. We argue that these capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference. We present Fast Weight Layers (FWLs), a neural component that provides the benefits of dynamic evaluation much more efficiently by expressing gradient updates as linear attention. A key improvement over dynamic evaluation is that FWLs can also be applied at training time, so the model learns to make good use of gradient updates. FWLs can easily be added on top of existing transformer models, require relatively little extra compute or memory to run, and significantly improve language modeling perplexity.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Without further parameter\nupdates, Transformers can learn to predict based on few in-context examples.\nHowever, the reason why Transformers becomes in-context learners is not well\nunderstood. Recently, several works [ASA+22,GTLV22,ONR+22] have studied the\nin-context learning from a mathematical perspective based on a linear\nregression formulation $\\min_x\\| Ax - b \\|_2$, which show Transformers'\ncapability of learning linear functions in context.\n  In this work, we study the in-context learning based on a softmax regression\nformulation $\\min_{x} \\| \\langle \\exp(Ax), {\\bf 1}_n \\rangle^{-1} \\exp(Ax) - b\n\\|_2$ of Transformer's attention mechanism. We show the upper bounds of the\ndata transformations induced by a single self-attention layer and by\ngradient-descent on a $\\ell_2$ regression loss for softmax prediction function,\nwhich imply that when training self-attention-only Transformers for fundamental\nregression tasks, the models learned by gradient-descent and Transformers show\ngreat similarity.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-26T04:33:41Z  (*Updated: 2023-04-26T04:33:41Z*)\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the AdaptiveLinearAttention (ALA) proposal, here are the key areas and information that need to be focused on:\n\n### Integration of Linear Attention and Meta-Learning\n\n- **Existing Methodologies:**\n  - Review papers like \"Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models\" and \"Why Can GPT Learn In-Context?

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 3. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Lightning Attention-2: A Free Lunch for Handling Unlimited Sequence Lengths in Large Language Models (Avg.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

However, it requires over 3x more compute than standard inference.

In the past half-decade since BERT first rose to prominence, many\nadvances have been made with other transformer architectures and training\nconfigurations that have yet to be systematically incorporated into BERT. Here,\nwe introduce MosaicBERT, a BERT-style encoder architecture and training recipe\nthat is empirically optimized for fast pretraining. This efficient architecture\nincorporates FlashAttention, Attention with Linear Biases (ALiBi), Gated Linear\nUnits (GLU), a module to dynamically remove padded tokens, and low precision\nLayerNorm into the classic transformer encoder block.

In this work, we\nstudy the dynamics of training a shallow transformer on a task of recognizing\nco-occurrence of two designated words. In the literature of studying training\ndynamics of transformers, several simplifications are commonly adopted such as\nweight reparameterization, attention linearization, special initialization, and\nlazy regime. In contrast, we analyze the gradient flow dynamics of\nsimultaneously training three attention matrices and a linear MLP layer from\nrandom initialization, and provide a framework of analyzing such dynamics via a\ncoupled dynamical system. We establish near minimum loss and characterize the\nattention model after training. We discover that gradient flow serves as an\ninherent mechanism that naturally divide the training process into two phases.\nIn Phase 1, the linear MLP quickly aligns with the two target signals for\ncorrect classification, whereas the softmax attention remains almost unchanged.\nIn Phase 2, the attention matrices and the MLP evolve jointly to enlarge the\nclassification margin and reduce the loss to a near minimum value. Technically,\nwe prove a novel property of the gradient flow, termed \\textit{automatic\nbalancing of gradients}, which enables the loss values of different samples to\ndecrease almost at the same rate and further facilitates the proof of near\nminimum training loss.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis:**\n\n- **Synergistic Integration of Linear Attention and Meta-Learning:**\n  \n  The ALA proposal's integration of linear attention with meta-learning aligns with emerging trends where meta-learning enhances attention mechanisms' adaptability. Papers like **\"Meta-Learning Fast Weight Language Models\"** and **\"Why Can GPT Learn In-Context?\"** highlight effective strategies for dynamic parameter updates and in-context learning through meta-learning frameworks. ALA's use of a **MetaLearner** to adjust attention weights dynamically echoes these successful integrations, potentially offering similar or improved benefits.\n\n- **Context-Adaptive Encoding Enhancements:**\n  \n  Techniques such as **Masked Sample Attention (MSA)** from **\"One Meta-tuned Transformer is What You Need for Few-shot Learning\"** and **\"Infini-attention\"** from internal sources demonstrate the efficacy of context-adaptive encoding in enhancing model performance across varied tasks and sequence lengths. ALA's context-adaptive encoding could draw inspiration from these methods to improve its adaptability and generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Efficiency and Scalability Benchmarks:**\n  \n  Internal studies like **\"When Linear Attention Meets Autoregressive Decoding\"** and external works such as **\"The Hedgehog & the Porcupine\"** showcase significant improvements in perplexity and generation speed through augmented linear attention mechanisms. ALA aims to achieve similar efficiency gains by reducing computational complexity from quadratic to linear, potentially allowing for scalable handling of longer sequences without compromising performance.\n\n- **Novel Weight Adjustment Mechanisms:**\n  \n  The introduction of **MetaLearner** in ALA for dynamic attention weight adjustment is a distinctive feature. While existing models like **Hedgehog** and **Fast Weight Layers** incorporate mechanisms to mimic or express gradient updates as attention weights, ALA's specific implementation and integration strategy may offer unique advantages. However, it is imperative to clearly delineate how ALA's **MetaLearner** differs from or enhances these existing methods to establish its novelty.\n\n- **Empirical Validation and Benchmarking Necessities:**\n  \n  Although theoretical benefits are promising, empirical validation through rigorous benchmarking against traditional MHA and other linear attention models is essential. Metrics such as perplexity reduction, generation speed improvements, and robustness across diverse contexts should be thoroughly evaluated to substantiate ALA's proposed advantages.\n\n- **Potential Overlapping and Differentiation:**\n  \n  Several existing approaches already explore the combination of linear attention and meta-learning or context-adaptive encoding. To ensure ALA's novelty, it must either introduce a novel mechanism or significantly enhance existing strategies. For instance, **Infini-attention** integrates compressive memory with linear attention and masked local attention, which may overlap with ALA's context-adaptive encoding. ALA must emphasize its unique contributions, such as specific meta-learning frameworks or novel augmentation techniques, to stand out.\n\n- **Training Stability and Optimization:**\n  \n  Incorporating meta-learning and dynamic adjustment mechanisms may introduce challenges related to training stability and optimization. Insights from papers like **\"Training Dynamics of Transformers to Recognize Word Co-occurrence via Gradient Flow Analysis\"** suggest that properties like automatic balancing of gradients are crucial for maintaining stable training. ALA should ensure that its dynamic weight adjustment mechanisms are designed to preserve gradient flow and prevent instability during training.\n\n**4.
