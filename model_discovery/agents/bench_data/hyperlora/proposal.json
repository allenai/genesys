Their success hinges on the fact that the underlying physical phenomena are continuous. For inherently discrete and categorical data such as language, various diffusion-inspired alternatives have been proposed. However, the continuous nature of diffusion models conveys many benefits, and in this work we endeavour to preserve it. We propose CDCD, a framework for modelling categorical data with diffusion models that are continuous both in time and input space.

Long-Short Transformer: Efficient Transformers for Language and Vision (Avg. Score: 0.96)\n\n*Chen Zhu, Wei Ping, Chaowei Xiao, M. Shoeybi, T. Goldstein, Anima Anandkumar, Bryan Catanzaro*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 106  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks, and proposes a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved success in both language and vision domains. However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/67 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2310.00726, 2023. 5.1, 8\nJimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Batch-shaping for learning conditional channel gated networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Residual Networks*\n\n*B. Bejnordi, Tijmen Blankevoort, M. Welling*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a new residual block architecture that gates convolutional channels in a fine-grained manner and introduces a generally applicable tool that matches the marginal aggregate posteriors of features in a neural network to a pre-specified prior distribution.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a method that trains large capacity neural networks with significantly improved accuracy and lower dynamic computational cost. We achieve this by gating the deep-learning architecture on a fine-grained-level. Individual convolutional maps are turned on/off conditionally on features in the network. To achieve this, we introduce a new residual block architecture that gates convolutional channels in a fine-grained manner. We also introduce a generally applicable tool $batch$-$shaping$ that matches the marginal aggregate posteriors of features in a neural network to a pre-specified prior distribution. We use this novel technique to force gates to be more conditional on the data. We present results on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets for image classification, and Cityscapes for semantic segmentation. Our results show that our method can slim down large architectures conditionally, such that the average computational cost on the data is on par with a smaller architecture, but with higher accuracy. In particular, on ImageNet, our ResNet50 and ResNet34 gated networks obtain 74.60% and 72.55% top-1 accuracy compared to the 69.76% accuracy of the baseline ResNet18 model, for similar complexity. We also show that the resulting networks automatically learn to use more features for difficult examples and fewer features for simple examples.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 72  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Generalization bounds for neural ordinary differential equations and deep residual networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Residual Networks*\n\n*P.

In this work, we consider a large family of parameterized ODEs with continuous-in-time parameters, which include time-dependent neural ODEs. We derive a generalization bound for this class by a Lipschitz-based argument. By leveraging the analogy between neural ODEs and deep residual networks, our approach yields in particular a generalization bound for a class of deep residual networks. The bound involves the magnitude of the difference between successive weight matrices. We illustrate numerically how this quantity affects the generalization capability of neural networks.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 15  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 3. Width and Depth Limits Commute in Residual Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Residual Networks*\n\n*Soufiane Hayou, Greg Yang*\n\n**Abstract:** We show that taking the width and depth to infinity in a deep neural network with skip connections, when branches are scaled by $1/\\sqrt{depth}$ (the only nontrivial scaling), result in the same covariance structure no matter how that limit is taken. This explains why the standard infinite-width-then-depth approach provides practical insights even for networks with depth of the same order as width. We also demonstrate that the pre-activations, in this case, have Gaussian distributions which has direct applications in Bayesian deep learning. We conduct extensive simulations that show an excellent match with our theoretical findings.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Enhancing Content Preservation in Text Style Transfer Using Reverse Attention and Conditional Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Layer Normalization*\n\n*Dongkyu Lee, Zhiliang Tian, Lanqing Xue, N. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention, and thereby retain the content, and creates not only style-independent content representation, but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style.\n\n**Abstract:** Text style transfer aims to alter the style (e.g., sentiment) of a sentence while preserving its content. A common approach is to map a given sentence to content representation that is free of style, and the content representation is fed to a decoder with a target style. Previous methods in filtering style completely remove tokens with style at the token level, which incurs the loss of content information. In this paper, we propose to enhance content preservation by implicitly removing the style information of each token with reverse attention, and thereby retain the content. Furthermore, we fuse content information when building the target style representation, making it dynamic with respect to the content. Our method creates not only style-independent content representation, but also content-dependent style representation in transferring style. Empirical results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin in terms of content preservation. In addition, it is also competitive in terms of style transfer accuracy and fluency.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 8*)\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Token Normalization Improves Vision Transformer\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Layer Normalization*\n\n*Wenqi Shao, Yixiao Ge, Zhaoyang Zhang, Xuyuan Xu, Xiaogang Wang, Ying Shan, P. Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token), which can represent various existing normalization methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants (e.g., Swin, PVT) have achieved great success in various computer vision tasks, owing to their capability to learn long-range contextual information. Layer Normalization (LN) is an essential ingredient in these models. However, we found that the ordinary LN makes tokens at different positions similar in magnitude because it normalizes embeddings within each token. It is difficult for Transformers to capture inductive bias such as the positional context in an image with LN. We tackle this problem by proposing a new normalizer, termed Dynamic Token Normalization (DTN), where normalization is performed both within each token (intra-token) and across different tokens (inter-token). DTN has several merits. Firstly, it is built on a unified formulation and thus can represent various existing normalization methods. Secondly, DTN learns to normalize tokens in both intra-token and inter-token manners, enabling Transformers to capture both the global contextual information and the local positional context. {Thirdly, by simply replacing LN layers, DTN can be readily plugged into various vision transformers, such as ViT, Swin, PVT, LeViT, T2T-ViT, BigBird and Reformer. Extensive experiments show that the transformer equipped with DTN consistently outperforms baseline model with minimal extra parameters and computational overhead. For example, DTN outperforms LN by $0.5\\%$ - $1.2\\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet, by $1.2$ - $1.4$ box AP in object detection on COCO benchmark, by $2.3\\%$ - $3.9\\%$ mCE in robustness experiments on ImageNet-C, and by $0.5\\%$ - $0.8\\%$ accuracy in Long ListOps on Long-Range Arena.} Codes will be made public at \\url{https://github.com/wqshao126/DTN}\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. Dynamic Normalization and Relay for Video Action Recognition\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Layer Normalization*\n\n*Dongqi Cai, Anbang Yao, Yurong Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, is presented, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been the dominant model for video action recognition. Due to the huge memory and compute demand, popular action recognition networks need to be trained with small batch sizes, which makes learning discriminative spatial-temporal representations for videos become a challenging problem. In this paper, we present Dynamic Normalization and Relay (DNR), an improved normalization design, to augment the spatial-temporal representation learning of any deep action recognition model, adapting to small batch size training settings. We observe that state-of-the-art action recognition networks usually apply the same normalization parameters to all video data, and ignore the dependencies of the estimated normalization parameters between neighboring frames (at the same layer) and between neighboring layers (with all frames of a video clip). Inspired by this, DNR introduces two dynamic normalization relay modules to explore the potentials of cross-temporal and cross-layer feature distribution dependencies for estimating accurate layer-wise normalization parameters. These two DNR modules are instantiated as a light-weight recurrent structure conditioned on the current input features, and the normalization parameters estimated from the neighboring frames based features at the same layer or from the whole video clip based features at the preceding layers. We \ufb01rst plug DNR into prevailing 2D CNN backbones and test its performance on public action recognition datasets including Kinetics and Something-Something. Experimental results show that DNR brings large performance improvements to the baselines, achieving over 4.4 % absolute margins in top-1 accuracy without training bells and whistles. More experiments on 3D backbones and several latest 2D spatial-temporal networks further validate its effectiveness.

Adaptive Gating in Mixture-of-Experts based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jiamin Li, Qiang Su, Yitao Yang, Yimin Jiang, Cong Wang, Hong-Yu Xu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive gating in MoE is introduced, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution that preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, have demonstrated exceptional language understanding capabilities in various NLP tasks. Sparsely activated mixture-of-experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising solution for scaling models while maintaining a constant number of computational operations. Existing MoE model adopts a fixed gating network where each token is computed by the same number of experts. However, this approach contradicts our intuition that the tokens in each sequence vary in terms of their linguistic complexity and, consequently, require different computational costs. Little is discussed in prior research on the trade-off between computation per token and model performance. This paper introduces adaptive gating in MoE, a flexible training strategy that allows tokens to be processed by a variable number of experts based on expert probability distribution. The proposed framework preserves sparsity while improving training efficiency. Additionally, curriculum learning is leveraged to further reduce training time. Extensive experiments on diverse NLP tasks show that adaptive gating reduces at most 22.5% training time while maintaining inference quality. Moreover, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of the routing decisions and present our insights when adaptive gating is used.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. Rare Tokens Degenerate All Tokens: Improving Neural Text Generation via Adaptive Gradient Gating for Rare Token Embeddings\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Sangwon Yu, Jongyoon Song, Heeseung Kim, SeongEun Lee, Woo-Jong Ryu, Sung-Hoon Yoon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study analyzes the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding and proposes a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating (AGG), which addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare tokenembeddings.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have determined that the learned token embeddings of large-scale neural language models are degenerated to be anisotropic with a narrow-cone shape. This phenomenon, called the representation degeneration problem, facilitates an increase in the overall similarity between token embeddings that negatively affect the performance of the models. Although the existing methods that address the degeneration problem based on observations of the phenomenon triggered by the problem improves the performance of the text generation, the training dynamics of token embeddings behind the degeneration problem are still not explored. In this study, we analyze the training dynamics of the token embeddings focusing on rare token embedding. We demonstrate that the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings is the key cause of the degeneration problem for all tokens during training stage. Based on the analysis, we propose a novel method called, adaptive gradient gating(AGG). AGG addresses the degeneration problem by gating the specific part of the gradient for rare token embeddings. Experimental results from language modeling, word similarity, and machine translation tasks quantitatively and qualitatively verify the effectiveness of AGG.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 26  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n#### 9. Gating Mechanisms for Combining Character and Word-level Word Representations: an Empirical Study\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Jorge A. Balazs, Y. Matsuo*\n\n**TL;DR:** There is strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper we study how different ways of combining character and word-level representations affect the quality of both final word and sentence representations. We provide strong empirical evidence that modeling characters improves the learned representations at the word and sentence levels, and that doing so is particularly useful when representing less frequent words. We further show that a feature-wise sigmoid gating mechanism is a robust method for creating representations that encode semantic similarity, as it performed reasonably well in several word similarity datasets. Finally, our findings suggest that properly capturing semantic similarity at the word level does not consistently yield improved performance in downstream sentence-level tasks.\n\n**Venue:** North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

This study investigates the effectiveness of various adapter\ntechniques, equivalent to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), for fine-tuning LLMs in a\nresource-constrained hospital environment. We experimented with four\nstructures-Adapter, Lightweight, TinyAttention, and Gated Residual Network\n(GRN)-as final layers for clinical notes classification. We fine-tuned\nbiomedical pre-trained models, including CamemBERT-bio, AliBERT, and DrBERT,\nalongside two Transformer-based models. Our extensive experimental results\nindicate that i) employing adapter structures does not yield significant\nimprovements in fine-tuning biomedical pre-trained LLMs, and ii) simpler\nTransformer-based models, trained from scratch, perform better under resource\nconstraints. Among the adapter structures, GRN demonstrated superior\nperformance with accuracy, precision, recall, and an F1 score of 0.88.\nMoreover, the total training time for LLMs exceeded 1000 hours, compared to\nunder 6 hours for simpler transformer-based models, highlighting that LLMs are\nmore suitable for environments with extensive computational resources and\nlarger datasets. Consequently, this study demonstrates that simpler\nTransformer-based models can be effectively trained from scratch, providing a\nviable solution for clinical NLP tasks in low-resource environments with\nlimited data availability.

By dynamically generating the scaling and shifting\nparameters in layer normalization, DLN adapts neural acoustic models to the\nacoustic variability arising from various factors such as speakers, channel\nnoises, and environments. Unlike other adaptive acoustic models, our proposed\napproach does not require additional adaptation data or speaker information\nsuch as i-vectors. Moreover, the model size is fixed as it dynamically\ngenerates adaptation parameters. We apply our proposed DLN to deep\nbidirectional LSTM acoustic models and evaluate them on two benchmark datasets\nfor large vocabulary ASR experiments: WSJ and TED-LIUM release 2. The\nexperimental results show that our DLN improves neural acoustic models in terms\nof transcription accuracy by dynamically adapting to various speakers and\nenvironments.\n\n**Published:** 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z  (*Updated: 2017-07-19T13:04:09Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 3. Incorporating Effective Global Information via Adaptive Gate Attention\n  for Text Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Xianming Li, Zongxi Li, Yingbin Zhao, Haoran Xie, Qing Li*\n\n**Abstract:** The dominant text classification studies focus on training classifiers using\ntextual instances only or introducing external knowledge (e.g., hand-craft\nfeatures and domain expert knowledge). In contrast, some corpus-level\nstatistical features, like word frequency and distribution, are not well\nexploited. Our work shows that such simple statistical information can enhance\nclassification performance both efficiently and significantly compared with\nseveral baseline models. In this paper, we propose a classifier with gate\nmechanism named Adaptive Gate Attention model with Global Information (AGA+GI),\nin which the adaptive gate mechanism incorporates global statistical features\ninto latent semantic features and the attention layer captures dependency\nrelationship within the sentence. To alleviate the overfitting issue, we\npropose a novel Leaky Dropout mechanism to improve generalization ability and\nperformance stability. Our experiments show that the proposed method can\nachieve better accuracy than CNN-based and RNN-based approaches without global\ninformation on several benchmarks.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-22T10:06:37Z  (*Updated: 2020-02-22T10:06:37Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 4. DEGAP: Dual Event-Guided Adaptive Prefixes for Templated-Based Event\n  Argument Extraction with Slot Querying\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Guanghui Wang, Dexi Liu, Jian-Yun Nie, Qizhi Wan, Rong Hu, Xiping Liu, Wanlong Liu, Jiaming Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating\nuseful auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as\nretrieved instances and event templates. These methods face two challenges: (1)\nthe retrieval results may be irrelevant and (2) templates are developed\nindependently for each event without considering their possible relationship.\nIn this work, we propose DEGAP to address these challenges through a simple yet\neffective components: dual prefixes, i.e. learnable prompt vectors, where the\ninstance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn\ninformation from different event instances and templates. Additionally, we\npropose an event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which can adaptively\nleverage possible connections between different events and thus capture\nrelevant information from the prefix. Finally, these event-guided prefixes\nprovide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further\nanalysis shows the impact of different components.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-22T03:56:55Z  (*Updated: 2024-06-15T15:40:49Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Balanced Binary Neural Networks with Gated Residual\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Residual Networks*\n\n*Xianglong Liu, Kai Han, Ruihao Gong, Mingzhu Shen*\n\n**Abstract:** Binary neural networks have attracted numerous attention in recent years. However, mainly due to the information loss stemming from the biased binarization, how to preserve the accuracy of networks still remains a critical issue. In this paper, we attempt to maintain the information propagated in the forward process and propose a Balanced Binary Neural Networks with Gated Residual (BBG for short). First, a weight balanced binarization is introduced to maximize information entropy of binary weights, and thus the informative binary weights can capture more information contained in the activations. Second, for binary activations, a gated residual is further appended to compensate their information loss during the forward process, with a slight overhead. Both techniques can be wrapped as a generic network module that supports various network architectures for different tasks including classification and detection. We evaluate our BBG on image classification tasks over CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet and on detection task over Pascal VOC. The experimental results show that BBG-Net performs remarkably well across various network architectures such as VGG, ResNet and SSD with the superior performance over state-of-the-art methods in terms of memory consumption, inference speed and accuracy.\n\n**Published:** 2019-09-26\n\n\n\n#### 2. SERNet-Former: Semantic Segmentation by Efficient Residual Network with Attention-Boosting Gates and Attention-Fusion Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Gated Residual Networks*\n\n*Serdar Erisen*\n\n**Abstract:** Improving the efficiency of state-of-the-art methods in semantic segmentation requires overcoming the increasing computational cost as well as issues such as fusing semantic information from global and local contexts. Based on the recent success and problems that convolutional neural networks (CNNs) encounter in semantic segmentation, this research proposes an encoder-decoder architecture with a unique efficient residual network, Efficient-ResNet. Attention-boosting gates (AbGs) and attention-boosting modules (AbMs) are deployed by aiming to fuse the equivariant and feature-based semantic information with the equivalent sizes of the output of global context of the efficient residual network in the encoder. Respectively, the decoder network is developed with the additional attention-fusion networks (AfNs) inspired by AbM. AfNs are designed to improve the efficiency in the one-to-one conversion of the semantic information by deploying additional convolution layers in the decoder part. Our network is tested on the challenging CamVid and Cityscapes datasets, and the proposed methods reveal significant improvements on the residual networks. To the best of our knowledge, the developed network, SERNet-Former, achieves state-of-the-art results (84.62 % mean IoU) on CamVid dataset and challenging results (87.35 % mean IoU) on Cityscapes validation dataset.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-28\n\n\n\n#### 3. MimicNorm: Weight Mean and Last BN Layer Mimic the Dynamic of Batch Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Layer Normalization*\n\n*Wenrui Dai, Hongkai Xiong, Junni Zou, Chenglin Li, Wen Fei*\n\n**Abstract:** Substantial experiments have validated the success of Batch Normalization (BN) Layer in benefiting convergence and generalization. However, BN requires extra memory and float-point calculation. Moreover, BN would be inaccurate on micro-batch, as it depends on batch statistics. In this paper, we address these problems by simplifying BN regularization while keeping two fundamental impacts of BN layers, i.e., data decorrelation and adaptive learning rate. We propose a novel normalization method, named MimicNorm, to improve the convergence and efficiency in network training. MimicNorm consists of only two light operations, including modified weight mean operations (subtract mean values from weight parameter tensor) and one BN layer before loss function (last BN layer). We leverage the neural tangent kernel (NTK) theory to prove that our weight mean operation whitens activations and transits network into the chaotic regime like BN layer, and consequently, leads to an enhanced convergence. The last BN layer provides autotuned learning rates and also improves accuracy. Experimental results show that MimicNorm achieves similar accuracy for various network structures, including ResNets and lightweight networks like ShuffleNet, with a reduction of about 20% memory consumption.

Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Layer Normalization*\n\n*Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, Geoffrey E. Hinton*\n\n**Abstract:** Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive.\nOne way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the\nneurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the\ndistribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training\ncases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the\nsummed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces\nthe training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch\nnormalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to\napply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch\nnormalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used\nfor normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a\nsingle training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its\nown adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before\nthe non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs\nexactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also\nstraightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the\nnormalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is\nvery effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks.\nEmpirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the\ntraining time compared with previously published techniques.\n\n**Published:** 2016-07-21\n\n\n\n#### 5. LLaMA-Adapter: Efficient Fine-tuning of Language Models with Zero-init Attention\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Peng Gao, Chris Liu, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Pan Lu, Shilin Yan, Xiangfei Hu, Aojun Zhou, Jiaming Han, Renrui Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** We present LLaMA-Adapter, a lightweight adaption method to efficiently fine-tune LLaMA into an instruction-following model. Using 52K self-instruct demonstrations, LLaMA-Adapter only introduces 1.2M learnable parameters upon the frozen LLaMA 7B model, and costs less than one hour for fine-tuning on 8 A100 GPUs. Specifically, we adopt a set of learnable adaption prompts, and prepend them to the word tokens at higher transformer layers. Then, a zero-initialized attention mechanism with zero gating is proposed, which adaptively injects the new instructional cues into LLaMA, while effectively preserves its pre-trained knowledge. With our efficient training, LLaMA-Adapter can generate high-quality responses, comparable to Alpaca with fully fine-tuned 7B parameters. Besides language commands, our approach can be simply extended to multi-modal instructions for learning image-conditioned LLaMA model, which achieves superior reasoning performance on ScienceQA and COCO Caption benchmarks. Furthermore, we also evaluate the zero-initialized attention mechanism for fine-tuning other pre-trained models (ViT, RoBERTa) on traditional vision and language tasks, demonstrating the superior generalization capacity of our approach. Code is released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/LLaMA-Adapter.\n\n**Published:** 2023-03-28\n\n\n\n#### 6. A Combinatorial Perspective on Transfer Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Gating Mechanisms*\n\n*Joel Veness, Marcus Hutter, David Budden, Eren Sezener, Jianan Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Human intelligence is characterized not only by the capacity to learn complex skills, but the ability to rapidly adapt and acquire new skills within an ever-changing environment. In this work we study how the learning of modular solutions can allow for effective generalization to both unseen and potentially differently distributed data. Our main postulate is that the combination of task segmentation, modular learning and memory-based ensembling can give rise to generalization on an exponentially growing number of unseen tasks. We provide a concrete instantiation of this idea using a combination of: (1) the Forget-Me-Not Process, for task segmentation and memory based ensembling; and (2) Gated Linear Networks, which in contrast to contemporary deep learning techniques use a modular and local learning mechanism. We demonstrate that this system exhibits a number of desirable continual learning properties: robustness to catastrophic forgetting, no negative transfer and increasing levels of positive transfer as more tasks are seen. We show competitive performance against both offline and online methods on standard continual learning benchmarks.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-23\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of enhancing Transformer models through adaptive gating mechanisms and dynamic layer normalization, here are some key points and relevant information from the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Adaptive Gating Mechanisms\n\n### Gated Residual Networks\nThe concept of gated residual networks is crucial here. While the exact term \"Gated Residual Networks\" is not directly mentioned in the provided sources, the idea of using gating mechanisms in neural networks is well-documented. For instance, the use of gates in recurrent neural networks (RNNs) like LSTMs and GRUs is a common practice to control information flow.\n\n### Dynamic Gated Neural Networks\nThe paper on \"Resource-Efficient Sensor Fusion via System-Wide Dynamic Gated Neural Networks\" provides a relevant example of how dynamic gated neural networks can be used to adaptively control the structure of the neural network model and the use of data sources based on input characteristics. This dynamic gating mechanism can be adapted to Transformer models to control the flow of information through residual connections.\n\n## Dynamic Layer Normalization\n\n### Layer Normalization Variants\nThe concept of dynamic layer normalization can be inferred from the discussion on layer normalization in general. Standard layer normalization stabilizes the training and convergence of deep neural networks by normalizing the inputs to each layer. Dynamic layer normalization would involve adjusting these normalization parameters based on the input context, which is not explicitly mentioned in the provided sources but is a logical extension of existing normalization techniques.\n\n### Contextual Adaptation\nThe idea of adapting normalization parameters dynamically is similar to how some models adjust their internal representations based on the input context. For example, the use of pre-activation residual blocks in ResNet architectures, where activation functions and normalization are applied before the residual function, shows how contextual adaptation can improve model performance.\n\n## Integrating Both Techniques\n\n### Combining Gating and Normalization\nTo enhance the MetaLearner GAU, integrating both adaptive gating mechanisms within residual connections and dynamic layer normalization could be highly beneficial. Here\u2019s how:\n\n- **Adaptive Gating:** Implement gating functions within the residual connections of the Transformer model. This can be done using functions like sigmoid or tanh to control the flow of information based on the input features.\n- **Dynamic Layer Normalization:** Replace standard layer normalization with a dynamic version that adjusts normalization parameters based on the input context. This can help the model adapt to different data distributions within the same batch.\n\n### Practical Implementation\nFor practical implementation, one can look at how dynamic gated neural networks are used in other contexts, such as sensor fusion, and adapt these concepts to language models. The use of gated mechanisms in RNNs and the residual connections in ResNets provide a solid foundation for this adaptation.\n\n## Key Insights and Future Search Plan\n\n### Efficiency and Robustness\n- **Efficiency:** Adaptive gating can reduce unnecessary computations by suppressing less important features, leading to efficiency gains.\n- **Robustness:** Dynamic normalization helps the model handle varied inputs more effectively, improving robustness across different contexts.\n\n### Training Stability\n- Carefully monitor and adjust training hyperparameters when introducing new components to ensure stability and convergence.\n\n### Future Search Plan\n- **Explore Practical Implementations:** Look for existing models that have successfully implemented similar techniques to guide practical implementation.\n- **Investigate Training Techniques:** Research best practices for training models with adaptive gating and dynamic normalization.\n- **Examine Compatibility:** Analyze how these modifications can be integrated into the existing seed design without disrupting other components.\n\n## References\n\nWhile the provided sources do not directly address the specific combination of adaptive gating and dynamic layer normalization in Transformer models, they offer relevant insights into the individual components:\n\n- **Dynamic Gated Neural Networks:**\n- **Layer Normalization and Residual Connections:**\n- **General Concepts of Gating in Neural Networks:**\n\nBy combining these concepts and adapting them to the Transformer architecture, the researcher can create a more efficient, scalable, and performant model.\n",

Existing RNN layers have linear complexity, but their performance in long context is limited by the expressive power of their hidden state. We propose a new class of sequence modeling layers with linear complexity and an expressive hidden state. The key idea is to make the hidden state a machine learning model itself, and the update rule a step of self-supervised learning. Since the hidden state is updated by training even on test sequences, our layers are called Test-Time Training (TTT) layers. We consider two instantiations: TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP, whose hidden state is a linear model and a two-layer MLP respectively. We evaluate our instantiations at the scale of 125M to 1.3B parameters, comparing with a strong Transformer and Mamba, a modern RNN. Both TTT-Linear and TTT-MLP match or exceed the baselines. Similar to Transformer, they can keep reducing perplexity by conditioning on more tokens, while Mamba cannot after 16k context. With preliminary systems optimization, TTT-Linear is already faster than Transformer at 8k context and matches Mamba in wall-clock time. TTT-MLP still faces challenges in memory I/O, but shows larger potential in long context, pointing to a promising direction for future research.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 39/51 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn International conference on machine learning, pages 5156-5165.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

However, the memory demands posed by the self-attention mechanism and the large feedforward network in Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby creating challenges for tasks involving multiple long sequences or long-term dependencies. We present a distinct approach, Blockwise Parallel Transformer (BPT), that leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward network fusion to minimize memory costs. By processing longer input sequences while maintaining memory efficiency, BPT enables training sequences 32 times longer than vanilla Transformers and up to 4 times longer than previous memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of BPT in reducing memory requirements and improving performance.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 18/24 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2112.05682, 2021.

However, mechanisms to explain its capabilities are not well understood. Focused on the training process, here we establish a meta-learning view of the Transformer architecture when trained for the causal language modeling task, by explicating an inner optimization process within the Transformer. Further, within the inner optimization, we discover and theoretically analyze a special characteristic of the norms of learned token representations within Transformer-based causal language models.

Under fairly general conditions, minimizing sequential prediction error, measured by the log loss, leads to implicit meta-learning. The goal of this work is to investigate how far this interpretation can be realized by current sequence prediction models and training regimes. The focus is on piecewise stationary sources with unobserved switching-points, which arguably capture an important characteristic of natural language and action-observation sequences in partially observable environments. We show that various types of memory-based neural models, including Transformers, LSTMs, and RNNs can learn to accurately approximate known Bayes-optimal algorithms and behave as if performing Bayesian inference over the latent switching-points and the latent parameters governing the data distribution within each segment.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Transformers are Meta-Reinforcement Learners\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-Learning in Transformers*\n\n*L. Melo*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture and shows that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture and variants presented remarkable success across many machine learning tasks in recent years. This success is intrinsically related to the capability of handling long sequences and the presence of context-dependent weights from the attention mechanism. We argue that these capabilities suit the central role of a Meta-Reinforcement Learning algorithm. Indeed, a meta-RL agent needs to infer the task from a sequence of trajectories. Furthermore, it requires a fast adaptation strategy to adapt its policy for a new task -- which can be achieved using the self-attention mechanism. In this work, we present TrMRL (Transformers for Meta-Reinforcement Learning), a meta-RL agent that mimics the memory reinstatement mechanism using the transformer architecture. It associates the recent past of working memories to build an episodic memory recursively through the transformer layers. We show that the self-attention computes a consensus representation that minimizes the Bayes Risk at each layer and provides meaningful features to compute the best actions. We conducted experiments in high-dimensional continuous control environments for locomotion and dexterous manipulation. Results show that TrMRL presents comparable or superior asymptotic performance, sample efficiency, and out-of-distribution generalization compared to the baselines in these environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 41  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 4. Dynamic and Efficient Inference for Text Generation via BERT Family\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Xiaobo Liang, Juntao Li, Lijun Wu, Ziqiang Cao, M. Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency and explores the effectiveness of the pre- trained MLMs for text generation tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the excellent performance of Pre-trained Language Models on many text generation tasks, they suffer from inefficient inference on computation and memory due to their large-scale parameters and the universal autoregressive decoding paradigm. In this work, we propose a novel fine-tuning method DEER, which can make a single pre-trained model support Dynamic and Efficient infERence and achieve an adaptive trade-off between model performance and latency. In particular, our critical insight is to jointly utilize the non-autoregressive (NAR) generation and dynamic parameter pruning techniques, which can flexibly control the decoding iteration steps and model sizes according to memory and latency limitations. Besides, we also explore the effectiveness of the pre-trained MLMs (i.e., the BERT family) for text generation tasks since their bidirectional attention nature is more suitable for the NAR training objective. Extensive experiments on both monolingual and multilingual pre-trained MLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DEER method by consistently achieving (1) higher BLEU scores than the strong autoregressive Transformer model on three neural machine translation tasks with 3 \\to 12 times speedup, (2) competitive performance (but with much faster inference speed) compared with the BART model on four GLGE benchmark tasks.

Lightweight, Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks for AMR-to-Text Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yan Zhang, Zhijiang Guo, Zhiyang Teng, Wei Lu, Shay B. Cohen, Zuozhu Liu, Lidong Bing*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs and develops two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** AMR-to-text generation is used to transduce Abstract Meaning Representation structures (AMR) into text. A key challenge in this task is to efficiently learn effective graph representations. Previously, Graph Convolution Networks (GCNs) were used to encode input AMRs, however, vanilla GCNs are not able to capture non-local information and additionally, they follow a local (first-order) information aggregation scheme. To account for these issues, larger and deeper GCN models are required to capture more complex interactions. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic fusion mechanism, proposing Lightweight Dynamic Graph Convolutional Networks (LDGCNs) that capture richer non-local interactions by synthesizing higher order information from the input graphs. We further develop two novel parameter saving strategies based on the group graph convolutions and weight tied convolutions to reduce memory usage and model complexity. With the help of these strategies, we are able to train a model with fewer parameters while maintaining the model capacity. Experiments demonstrate that LDGCNs outperform state-of-the-art models on two benchmark datasets for AMR-to-text generation with significantly fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 17  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 7.

To enable this advance, we explore a novel adaptive Gradient Scaling technique (GradScale) that addresses the challenges of insuf\ufb01cient range and resolution in quantized gradients as well as explores the impact of quantization errors observed during model training. We theoretically analyze the role of bias in gradient quantization and propose solutions that mitigate the impact of this bias on model convergence. Finally, we examine our techniques on a spectrum of deep learning models in computer vision, speech and NLP. In combination with previously proposed solutions for 4-bit quantization of weight and activation tensors, 4-bit training shows non-signi\ufb01cant loss in accuracy across application domains while enabling signi\ufb01cant hardware acceleration (>7 \u00d7 over state of the art FP16 systems).\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 150  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 8. Fully Hyperbolic Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Neural Networks in NLP*\n\n*Weize Chen, Xu Han, Yankai Lin, Hexu Zhao, Zhiyuan Liu, Peng Li, Maosong Sun, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that linear transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly limiting the capabilities of existing hyperBolic networks.\n\n**Abstract:** Hyperbolic neural networks have shown great potential for modeling complex data. However, existing hyperbolic networks are not completely hyperbolic, as they encode features in the hyperbolic space yet formalize most of their operations in the tangent space (a Euclidean subspace) at the origin of the hyperbolic model. This hybrid method greatly limits the modeling ability of networks. In this paper, we propose a fully hyperbolic framework to build hyperbolic networks based on the Lorentz model by adapting the Lorentz transformations (including boost and rotation) to formalize essential operations of neural networks. Moreover, we also prove that linear transformation in tangent spaces used by existing hyperbolic networks is a relaxation of the Lorentz rotation and does not include the boost, implicitly limiting the capabilities of existing hyperbolic networks. The experimental results on four NLP tasks show that our method has better performance for building both shallow and deep networks.

Improving Distant Supervised Relation Extraction by Dynamic Neural\n  Network\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yanjie Gou, Yinjie Lei, Lingqiao Liu, Pingping Zhang, Xi Peng*\n\n**Abstract:** Distant Supervised Relation Extraction (DSRE) is usually formulated as a\nproblem of classifying a bag of sentences that contain two query entities, into\nthe predefined relation classes. Most existing methods consider those relation\nclasses as distinct semantic categories while ignoring their potential\nconnection to query entities. In this paper, we propose to leverage this\nconnection to improve the relation extraction accuracy. Our key ideas are\ntwofold: (1) For sentences belonging to the same relation class, the expression\nstyle, i.e. words choice, can vary according to the query entities. To account\nfor this style shift, the model should adjust its parameters in accordance with\nentity types. (2) Some relation classes are semantically similar, and the\nentity types appear in one relation may also appear in others. Therefore, it\ncan be trained cross different relation classes and further enhance those\nclasses with few samples, i.e., long-tail classes. To unify these two\narguments, we developed a novel Dynamic Neural Network for Relation Extraction\n(DNNRE).

Meta-Transformer: A Unified Framework for Multimodal Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-Learning in Transformers*\n\n*Xiangyu Yue, Wanli Ouyang, Yu Qiao, Hongsheng Li, Kaipeng Zhang, Kaixiong Gong, Yiyuan Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Multimodal learning aims to build models that can process and relate information from multiple modalities. Despite years of development in this field, it still remains challenging to design a unified network for processing various modalities ($\\textit{e.g.}$ natural language, 2D images, 3D point clouds, audio, video, time series, tabular data) due to the inherent gaps among them. In this work, we propose a framework, named Meta-Transformer, that leverages a $\\textbf{frozen}$ encoder to perform multimodal perception without any paired multimodal training data. In Meta-Transformer, the raw input data from various modalities are mapped into a shared token space, allowing a subsequent encoder with frozen parameters to extract high-level semantic features of the input data. Composed of three main components: a unified data tokenizer, a modality-shared encoder, and task-specific heads for downstream tasks, Meta-Transformer is the first framework to perform unified learning across 12 modalities with unpaired data. Experiments on different benchmarks reveal that Meta-Transformer can handle a wide range of tasks including fundamental perception (text, image, point cloud, audio, video), practical application (X-Ray, infrared, hyperspectral, and IMU), and data mining (graph, tabular, and time-series). Meta-Transformer indicates a promising future for developing unified multimodal intelligence with transformers.

Graph Transformer Networks: Learning Meta-path Graphs to Improve GNNs\n\n*From Search Query: Meta-Learning in Transformers*\n\n*Hyunwoo J. Kim, Jaewoo Kang, Raehyun Kim, Sean S. Yi, Seunghun Lee, Sungdong Yoo, Minbyul Jeong, Seongjun Yun*\n\n**Abstract:** Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely applied to various fields due to their powerful representations of graph-structured data. Despite the success of GNNs, most existing GNNs are designed to learn node representations on the fixed and homogeneous graphs. The limitations especially become problematic when learning representations on a misspecified graph or a heterogeneous graph that consists of various types of nodes and edges. To address this limitations, we propose Graph Transformer Networks (GTNs) that are capable of generating new graph structures, which preclude noisy connections and include useful connections (e.g., meta-paths) for tasks, while learning effective node representations on the new graphs in an end-to-end fashion. We further propose enhanced version of GTNs, Fast Graph Transformer Networks (FastGTNs), that improve scalability of graph transformations. Compared to GTNs, FastGTNs are 230x faster and use 100x less memory while allowing the identical graph transformations as GTNs. In addition, we extend graph transformations to the semantic proximity of nodes allowing non-local operations beyond meta-paths. Extensive experiments on both homogeneous graphs and heterogeneous graphs show that GTNs and FastGTNs with non-local operations achieve the state-of-the-art performance for node classification tasks.

Joint Parameter Discovery and Generative Modeling of Dynamic Systems\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Tzikang Chen, Mulugeta A. Haile, Gregory Barber*\n\n**Abstract:** Given an unknown dynamic system such as a coupled harmonic oscillator with $n$ springs and point masses. We are often interested in gaining insights into its physical parameters, i.e. stiffnesses and masses, by observing trajectories of motion. How do we achieve this from video frames or time-series data and without the knowledge of the dynamics model? We present a neural framework for estimating physical parameters in a manner consistent with the underlying physics. The neural framework uses a deep latent variable model to disentangle the system physical parameters from canonical coordinate observations. It then returns a Hamiltonian parameterization that generalizes well with respect to the discovered physical parameters. We tested our framework with simple harmonic oscillators, $n=1$, and noisy observations and show that it discovers the underlying system parameters and generalizes well with respect to these discovered parameters. Our model also extrapolates the dynamics of the system beyond the training interval and outperforms a non-physically constrained baseline model.

ConvBERT: Improving BERT with Span-based Dynamic Convolution\n\n*From Search Query: Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Zi-Hang Jiang, Yunpeng Chen, Weihao Yu, Jiashi Feng, Shuicheng Yan, Daquan Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models like BERT and its variants have recently achieved impressive performance in various natural language understanding tasks. However, BERT heavily relies on the global self-attention block and thus suffers large memory footprint and computation cost. Although all its attention heads query on the whole input sequence for generating the attention map from a global perspective, we observe some heads only need to learn local dependencies, which means the existence of computation redundancy. We therefore propose a novel span-based dynamic convolution to replace these self-attention heads to directly model local dependencies. The novel convolution heads, together with the rest self-attention heads, form a new mixed attention block that is more efficient at both global and local context learning. We equip BERT with this mixed attention design and build a ConvBERT model. Experiments have shown that ConvBERT significantly outperforms BERT and its variants in various downstream tasks, with lower training cost and fewer model parameters. Remarkably, ConvBERTbase model achieves 86.4 GLUE score, 0.7 higher than ELECTRAbase, while using less than 1/4 training cost. Code and pre-trained models will be released.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-08-06\n\n\n\n#### 5. VSR: A Unified Framework for Document Layout Analysis combining Vision, Semantics and Relations\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Neural Networks in NLP*\n\n*Fei Wu, Yi Niu, ShiLiang Pu, Zhanzhan Cheng, Liang Qiao, Can Li, Peng Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Document layout analysis is crucial for understanding document structures. On this task, vision and semantics of documents, and relations between layout components contribute to the understanding process. Though many works have been proposed to exploit the above information, they show unsatisfactory results. NLP-based methods model layout analysis as a sequence labeling task and show insufficient capabilities in layout modeling. CV-based methods model layout analysis as a detection or segmentation task, but bear limitations of inefficient modality fusion and lack of relation modeling between layout components. To address the above limitations, we propose a unified framework VSR for document layout analysis, combining vision, semantics and relations. VSR supports both NLP-based and CV-based methods. Specifically, we first introduce vision through document image and semantics through text embedding maps. Then, modality-specific visual and semantic features are extracted using a two-stream network, which are adaptively fused to make full use of complementary information. Finally, given component candidates, a relation module based on graph neural network is incorported to model relations between components and output final results. On three popular benchmarks, VSR outperforms previous models by large margins. Code will be released soon.\n\n**Published:** 2021-05-13\n\n\n\n#### 6. Conditional Prompt Learning for Vision-Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Neural Networks in NLP*\n\n*Ziwei Liu, Chen Change Loy, Jingkang Yang, Kaiyang Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** With the rise of powerful pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP, it becomes essential to investigate ways to adapt these models to downstream datasets. A recently proposed method named Context Optimization (CoOp) introduces the concept of prompt learning -- a recent trend in NLP -- to the vision domain for adapting pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, CoOp turns context words in a prompt into a set of learnable vectors and, with only a few labeled images for learning, can achieve huge improvements over intensively-tuned manual prompts. In our study we identify a critical problem of CoOp: the learned context is not generalizable to wider unseen classes within the same dataset, suggesting that CoOp overfits base classes observed during training. To address the problem, we propose Conditional Context Optimization (CoCoOp), which extends CoOp by further learning a lightweight neural network to generate for each image an input-conditional token (vector). Compared to CoOp's static prompts, our dynamic prompts adapt to each instance and are thus less sensitive to class shift. Extensive experiments show that CoCoOp generalizes much better than CoOp to unseen classes, even showing promising transferability beyond a single dataset; and yields stronger domain generalization performance as well. Code is available at https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp.\n\n**Proceeding:** cvpr-2022-1\n\n**Published:** 2022-03-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of integrating meta-learning techniques, dynamic parameter generation, and adaptive neural networks into a Transformer architecture for natural language processing (NLP), here are the most relevant and useful insights from the provided sources and analysis:\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n- **HyperNetworks**: Utilizing HyperNetworks to generate weights for the main Transformer model dynamically is a promising approach.

We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/36 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nRabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, and James Henderson. 2021.

Over the last couple of years, the number of parameters in state-of-the-art NLP transformers has grown drastically, from the original 340 million introduced in BERT-Large to 175 billion in GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020). Although these large-scale models yield impressive results on wide variety of tasks, training and deploying such model are slow in practice. For example, the original BERT-Large model (Devlin et al., 2019) takes four days to train on 16 Cloud TPUs, and the recent GPT-3 (Brown et al., 2020) consumed orders of magnitude more petaflops / day to train compared to its predecessor, GPT-2 (Radford et al. 2019). Beyond training, deploying Transformer models to real world applications is also expensive, usually requiring extensive distillation (Hinton et al. 2015) or compression. The main efficiency bottleneck in Transformer models is its self-attention mechanism. Here, each token's representation is updated by attending to all other tokens in the previous layer. This operation is key for retaining long-term information, giving Transformers the edge over recurrent models on long sequences. However, attending to all tokens at each layer incurs a complexity of $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ with respect to sequence length. Thus, in this paper, we seek to answer the question: can Transformer models be optimized to avoid this quadratic operation, or is this operation required to maintain strong performance? Prior work has proposed several techniques for improving the efficiency of self-attention. One popular technique is introducing sparsity into attention layers (Child et al., 2019, Qiu et al., 2019, Beltagy et al. 2020) by having each token attend to only a subset of tokens in the whole sequence. This reduces the overall complexity of the attention mechanism to $O(n \\sqrt{n})$ (Child et al., 2019). However, as shown in Qiu et al. (2019), this approach suffers from a large performance drop with limited efficiency gains, i.e., a $2 \\%$ drop with only $20 \\%$ speed up. More recently, the Reformer (Kitaev et al. 2020) used locally-sensitive hashing (LSH) to reduce the self-attention complexity to $O(n \\log (n))$. However, in practice, the Reformer's efficiency gains only appear on sequences with length $>2048$ (Figure 5 in Kitaev et al. (2020)). Furthermore, the Reformer's multi-round hashing approach actually increases the number of sequential operations, which further undermines their final efficiency gains. In this work, we introduce a novel approach for tackling the self-attention bottleneck in Transformers. Our approach is inspired by the key observation that self-attention is low rank. More precisely, we show both theoretically and empirically that the stochastic matrix formed by self-attention can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. Empowered by this observation, we introduce a novel mechanism that reduces self-attention to an $O(n)$ operation in both space- and time-complexity: we decompose the original scaled dot-product attention into multiple smaller attentions through linear projections, such that the combination of these operations forms a low-rank factorization of the original attention. A summary of runtimes for various Transformer architectures, including ours, can be found in Table 1\n\nOne predominant application of Transformers, that has seen the most gains, is using them as pretrained language models, whereby models are first pretrained with a language modeling objective on a large corpus, then finetuned on target tasks using supervised data (Devlin et al., 2019, Liu et al., 2019, Lewis et al.\n```\n\n#### 4. Improving Transformers with Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Da Xiao, Qingye Meng, Shengping Li, Xingyuan Yuan*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** D Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads.\n\n**Abstract:** Multi-Head Attention (MHA) is a key component of Transformer. In MHA, attention heads work independently, causing problems such as low-rank bottleneck of attention score matrices and head redundancy. We propose Dynamically Composable Multi-Head Attention (DCMHA), a parameter and computation efficient attention architecture that tackles the shortcomings of MHA and increases the expressive power of the model by dynamically composing attention heads. At the core of DCMHA is a $\\it{Compose}$ function that transforms the attention score and weight matrices in an input-dependent way. DCMHA can be used as a drop-in replacement of MHA in any transformer architecture to obtain the corresponding DCFormer. DCFormer significantly outperforms Transformer on different architectures and model scales in language modeling, matching the performance of models with ~1.7x-2.0x compute. For example, DCPythia-6.9B outperforms open source Pythia-12B on both pretraining perplexity and downstream task evaluation.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Parameter-efficient Multi-task Fine-tuning for Transformers via Shared Hypernetworks\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Transformers*\n\n*Rabeeh Karimi Mahabadi, Sebastian Ruder, Mostafa Dehghani, J. Henderson*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper shows that one can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model.\n\n**Abstract:** State-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods rely on introducing adapter modules between the layers of a pretrained language model. However, such modules are trained separately for each task and thus do not enable sharing information across tasks. In this paper, we show that we can learn adapter parameters for all layers and tasks by generating them using shared hypernetworks, which condition on task, adapter position, and layer id in a transformer model. This parameter-efficient multi-task learning framework allows us to achieve the best of both worlds by sharing knowledge across tasks via hypernetworks while enabling the model to adapt to each individual task through task-specific adapters. Experiments on the well-known GLUE benchmark show improved performance in multi-task learning while adding only 0.29% parameters per task. We additionally demonstrate substantial performance improvements in few-shot domain generalization across a variety of tasks.

Learning Semantic Proxies from Visual Prompts for Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Deep Metric Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Transformers*\n\n*Li Ren, Chen Chen, Liqiang Wang, Kien Hua*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel and effective framework based on learning Visual Prompts (VPT) in the pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT) based on the conventional proxy-based DML paradigm is proposed, which achieves comparable or even better performance than recent state-of-the-art full fine-tuning works of DML while tuning only a small percentage of total parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Deep Metric Learning (DML) has long attracted the attention of the machine learning community as a key objective. Existing solutions concentrate on fine-tuning the pre-trained models on conventional image datasets. As a result of the success of recent pre-trained models trained from larger-scale datasets, it is challenging to adapt the model to the DML tasks in the local data domain while retaining the previously gained knowledge. In this paper, we investigate parameter-efficient methods for fine-tuning the pre-trained model for DML tasks. In particular, we propose a novel and effective framework based on learning Visual Prompts (VPT) in the pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViT). Based on the conventional proxy-based DML paradigm, we augment the proxy by incorporating the semantic information from the input image and the ViT, in which we optimize the visual prompts for each class. We demonstrate that our new approximations with semantic information are superior to representative capabilities, thereby improving metric learning performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that our proposed framework is effective and efficient by evaluating popular DML benchmarks. In particular, we demonstrate that our fine-tuning method achieves comparable or even better performance than recent state-of-the-art full fine-tuning works of DML while tuning only a small percentage of total parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Polyhistor: Parameter-Efficient Multi-Task Adaptation for Dense Vision Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Transformers*\n\n*Yen-Cheng Liu, Chih-Yao Ma, Junjiao Tian, Zijian He, Z. Kira*\n\n**TL;DR:** Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite are proposed, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters, to achieve competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of theirTrainable parameters.\n\n**Abstract:** Adapting large-scale pretrained models to various downstream tasks via fine-tuning is a standard method in machine learning. Recently, parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods show promise in adapting a pretrained model to different tasks while training only a few parameters. Despite their success, most existing methods are proposed in Natural Language Processing tasks with language Transformers, and adaptation to Computer Vision tasks with Vision Transformers remains under-explored, especially for dense vision tasks. Further, in multi-task settings, individually fine-tuning and storing separate models for different tasks is inefficient. In this work, we provide an extensive multi-task parameter-efficient benchmark and examine existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning NLP methods for vision tasks. Our results on four different dense vision tasks showed that existing methods cannot be efficiently integrated due to the hierarchical nature of the Hierarchical Vision Transformers. To overcome this issue, we propose Polyhistor and Polyhistor-Lite, consisting of Decomposed HyperNetworks and Layer-wise Scaling Kernels, to share information across different tasks with a few trainable parameters. This leads to favorable performance improvements against existing parameter-efficient methods while using fewer trainable parameters. Specifically, Polyhistor achieves competitive accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art while only using ~10% of their trainable parameters. Furthermore, our methods show larger performance gains when large networks and more pretraining data are used.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 37  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4. Sparse Low-rank Adaptation of Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation for Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Ning Ding, Xingtai Lv, Qiaosen Wang, Yulin Chen, Bowen Zhou, Zhiyuan Liu, Maosong Sun*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work extends the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach the authors call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process, and introduces a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning pre-trained large language models in a parameter-efficient manner is widely studied for its effectiveness and efficiency. The popular method of low-rank adaptation (LoRA) offers a notable approach, hypothesizing that the adaptation process is intrinsically low-dimensional. Although LoRA has demonstrated commendable performance, it is implemented with a fixed and unalterable intrinsic rank that might not always be the ideal choice. Recognizing the need for more flexible adaptation, we extend the methodology of LoRA to an innovative approach we call sparse low-rank adaptation (SoRA) that enables dynamic adjustments to the intrinsic rank during the adaptation process. We achieve this through the incorporation of a gate unit optimized with proximal gradient method in the training stage, controlling the cardinality of rank under the sparsity of the gate. In the subsequent inference stage, we eliminate the parameter blocks corresponding to the zeroed-out ranks, to reduce each SoRA module back to a concise yet rank-optimal LoRA. Our approach strengthens the representation power of LoRA by initializing it with a higher rank, while efficiently taming a temporarily increased number of parameters via updating in a sparse way. We further introduce a sparsifying scheduler for SoRA, aiming to examine the impact of the number of non-zero parameters on the model's memorization and generalization. Our experimental results demonstrate that SoRA can outperform other baselines even with 70% retained parameters and 70% training time.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 22  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 5.

Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has demonstrated commendable performance as a popular and representative method. However, it is implemented with a fixed intrinsic rank that might not be the ideal setting for the downstream tasks.

First, we propose a novel method, AB-LoRA, that can effectively estimate the importance score of each LoRA rank. Second, guided by AB-LoRA, we gradually prune abundant and negatively impacting LoRA ranks and allocate the pruned LoRA budgets to important Transformer modules needing higher ranks.

Batched Low-Rank Adaptation of Foundation Models\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation for Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Yeming Wen, Swarat Chaudhuri*\n\n**TL;DR:** Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests, is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has recently gained attention for fine-tuning foundation models by incorporating trainable low-rank matrices, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters. While LoRA offers numerous advantages, its applicability for real-time serving to a diverse and global user base is constrained by its incapability to handle multiple task-specific adapters efficiently. This imposes a performance bottleneck in scenarios requiring personalized, task-specific adaptations for each incoming request. To mitigate this constraint, we introduce Fast LoRA (FLoRA), a framework in which each input example in a minibatch can be associated with its unique low-rank adaptation weights, allowing for efficient batching of heterogeneous requests. We empirically demonstrate that FLoRA retains the performance merits of LoRA, showcasing competitive results on the MultiPL-E code generation benchmark spanning over 8 languages and a multilingual speech recognition task across 6 languages.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning with Discrete Fourier Transform\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Transformers*\n\n*Jia Li, Liang Chen, Bingzhe Wu, Zijing Liu, Aochuan Chen, Qichao Wang, Ziqi Gao*\n\n**Abstract:** Low-rank adaptation~(LoRA) has recently gained much interest in fine-tuning foundation models. It effectively reduces the number of trainable parameters by incorporating low-rank matrices $A$ and $B$ to represent the weight change, i.e., $\\Delta W=BA$. Despite LoRA's progress, it faces storage challenges when handling extensive customization adaptations or larger base models. In this work, we aim to further compress trainable parameters by enjoying the powerful expressiveness of the Fourier transform. Specifically, we introduce FourierFT, which treats $\\Delta W$ as a matrix in the spatial domain and learns only a small fraction of its spectral coefficients. With the trained spectral coefficients, we implement the inverse discrete Fourier transform to recover $\\Delta W$. Empirically, our FourierFT method shows comparable or better performance with fewer parameters than LoRA on various tasks, including natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and image classification. For example, when performing instruction tuning on the LLaMA2-7B model, FourierFT surpasses LoRA with only 0.064M trainable parameters, compared to LoRA's 33.5M.

BitFit: Simple Parameter-efficient Fine-tuning for Transformer-based Masked Language-models\n\n*From Search Query: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning in Transformers*\n\n*Yoav Goldberg, Shauli Ravfogel, Elad Ben Zaken*\n\n**Abstract:** We introduce BitFit, a sparse-finetuning method where only the bias-terms of the model (or a subset of them) are being modified. We show that with small-to-medium training data, applying BitFit on pre-trained BERT models is competitive with (and sometimes better than) fine-tuning the entire model. For larger data, the method is competitive with other sparse fine-tuning methods. Besides their practical utility, these findings are relevant for the question of understanding the commonly-used process of finetuning: they support the hypothesis that finetuning is mainly about exposing knowledge induced by language-modeling training, rather than learning new task-specific linguistic knowledge.\n\n**Proceeding:** acl-2022-5\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. DyLoRA: Parameter Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Models using Dynamic Search-Free Low-Rank Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation for Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Ali Ghodsi, Ivan Kobyzev, Mehdi Rezagholizadeh, Mojtaba Valipour*\n\n**Abstract:** With the ever-growing size of pretrained models (PMs), fine-tuning them has become more expensive and resource-hungry. As a remedy, low-rank adapters (LoRA) keep the main pretrained weights of the model frozen and just introduce some learnable truncated SVD modules (so-called LoRA blocks) to the model. While LoRA blocks are parameter-efficient, they suffer from two major problems: first, the size of these blocks is fixed and cannot be modified after training (for example, if we need to change the rank of LoRA blocks, then we need to re-train them from scratch); second, optimizing their rank requires an exhaustive search and effort. In this work, we introduce a dynamic low-rank adaptation (DyLoRA) technique to address these two problems together. Our DyLoRA method trains LoRA blocks for a range of ranks instead of a single rank by sorting the representation learned by the adapter module at different ranks during training. We evaluate our solution on different natural language understanding (GLUE benchmark) and language generation tasks (E2E, DART and WebNLG) using different pretrained models such as RoBERTa and GPT with different sizes. Our results show that we can train dynamic search-free models with DyLoRA at least 4 to 7 times (depending to the task) faster than LoRA without significantly compromising performance. Moreover, our models can perform consistently well on a much larger range of ranks compared to LoRA.\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-14\n\n\n\n#### 4. X-Dreamer: Creating High-quality 3D Content by Bridging the Domain Gap Between Text-to-2D and Text-to-3D Generation\n\n*From Search Query: Low-Rank Adaptation for Dynamic Parameter Generation*\n\n*Rongrong Ji, Annan Shu, Guannan Jiang, Xiaoshuai Sun, Haowei Wang, Jiayi Ji, Yijun Fan, Yiwei Ma*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent times, automatic text-to-3D content creation has made significant progress, driven by the development of pretrained 2D diffusion models. Existing text-to-3D methods typically optimize the 3D representation to ensure that the rendered image aligns well with the given text, as evaluated by the pretrained 2D diffusion model. Nevertheless, a substantial domain gap exists between 2D images and 3D assets, primarily attributed to variations in camera-related attributes and the exclusive presence of foreground objects. Consequently, employing 2D diffusion models directly for optimizing 3D representations may lead to suboptimal outcomes. To address this issue, we present X-Dreamer, a novel approach for high-quality text-to-3D content creation that effectively bridges the gap between text-to-2D and text-to-3D synthesis. The key components of X-Dreamer are two innovative designs: Camera-Guided Low-Rank Adaptation (CG-LoRA) and Attention-Mask Alignment (AMA) Loss. CG-LoRA dynamically incorporates camera information into the pretrained diffusion models by employing camera-dependent generation for trainable parameters. This integration enhances the alignment between the generated 3D assets and the camera's perspective. AMA loss guides the attention map of the pretrained diffusion model using the binary mask of the 3D object, prioritizing the creation of the foreground object. This module ensures that the model focuses on generating accurate and detailed foreground objects. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method compared to existing text-to-3D approaches.

This approach significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters, making fine-tuning more efficient.\n  - For example, LoRA involves updating the weight matrix using the outer product of two low-rank matrices, which does not introduce any computation overhead during inference.\n\n## Integration with HyperNetworks\n\n- **HyperNetworks** generate weights for a main network dynamically based on input data. Combining HyperNetworks with LoRA allows for dynamic generation of low-rank weight updates, enhancing adaptability and efficiency.\n  - This integration enables the model to adjust its parameters on-the-fly, improving performance on diverse tasks and inputs without significantly increasing the number of trainable parameters[Analysis Note: Integrating HyperNetworks and LoRA].\n\n## Practical Implementations and Tools\n\n- The **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning) library** provides several adapter-based tuning methods, including LoRA, AdaLoRA, and others. This library is crucial for implementing these techniques efficiently and integrating them with other optimization libraries.\n  - For instance, PEFT supports various methods like LoRA, AdaLoRA, and OFT, which introduce low-rank matrix adaptations to pre-trained models, enabling efficient fine-tuning.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability\n\n- **QLoRA**, an extension of LoRA, quantizes the model's parameters and fine-tunes an adapter on top, making it even more memory-efficient. This method is particularly useful for resource-constrained environments and can be combined with other quantization methods like AutoRound for faster fine-tuning.\n  - QLoRA with AutoRound is shown to be faster and more efficient than traditional LoRA methods, making it a viable option for large-scale models.\n\n## Selective Layer Adaptation\n\n- Focusing on adapting key layers such as attention layers or feed-forward networks can balance performance gains with computational cost. This selective approach is supported by research indicating that adapting only certain layers can maintain performance while reducing computational overhead.\n\n## Training and Implementation Strategies\n\n- **Training HyperNetworks** can be stabilized by pretraining or initializing them with weights from a pre-trained model. Regularization techniques and careful hyperparameter tuning are essential to ensure convergence[Analysis Note: Addressing Challenges].\n  - The use of meta-learning algorithms can also be explored to make the training process more computationally efficient[Analysis Note: Future Search Plan and Next Steps].\n\n## Real-World Implementations and Case Studies\n\n- While the provided sources do not include specific case studies of combining HyperNetworks and LoRA, the theoretical foundations and practical implementations described in the PEFT library and other research papers provide a solid basis for real-world applications.\n  - The researcher can explore further by looking into implementations where similar techniques have been applied in NLP tasks to understand practical considerations and optimizations[Analysis Note: Future Search Plan and Next Steps].\n\nBy integrating these insights, the researcher can formulate a detailed proposal that includes:\n\n- **Modifying the MetaLearner GAU** to generate LoRA updates dynamically using HyperNetworks.\n- **Selective layer adaptation** to balance performance and computational cost.\n- **Efficient training strategies** using pretraining, regularization, and meta-learning algorithms.\n- **Practical implementation** using tools like the PEFT library and efficient quantization methods like QLoRA with AutoRound.\n\nThis approach will enhance the efficiency, scalability, and adaptability of the MetaLearner GAU, aligning with the researcher's goals.\n",

Max-Margin Token Selection in Attention Mechanism (Avg. Score: 0.94)\n\n*Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Yingcong Li, Xuechen Zhang, Samet Oymak*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 20  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores the seminal softmax-attention model and proves that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optical ones, which clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism.\n\n**Abstract:** Attention mechanism is a central component of the transformer architecture which led to the phenomenal success of large language models. However, the theoretical principles underlying the attention mechanism are poorly understood, especially its nonconvex optimization dynamics. In this work, we explore the seminal softmax-attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\langle \\boldsymbol{Xv}, \\texttt{softmax}(\\boldsymbol{XWp})\\rangle$, where $\\boldsymbol{X}$ is the token sequence and $(\\boldsymbol{v},\\boldsymbol{W},\\boldsymbol{p})$ are trainable parameters. We prove that running gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$, or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$, converges in direction to a max-margin solution that separates $\\textit{locally-optimal}$ tokens from non-optimal ones. This clearly formalizes attention as an optimal token selection mechanism. Remarkably, our results are applicable to general data and precisely characterize $\\textit{optimality}$ of tokens in terms of the value embeddings $\\boldsymbol{Xv}$ and problem geometry. We also provide a broader regularization path analysis that establishes the margin maximizing nature of attention even for nonlinear prediction heads. When optimizing $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and $\\boldsymbol{p}$ simultaneously with logistic loss, we identify conditions under which the regularization paths directionally converge to their respective hard-margin SVM solutions where $\\boldsymbol{v}$ separates the input features based on their labels. Interestingly, the SVM formulation of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ is influenced by the support vector geometry of $\\boldsymbol{v}$. Finally, we verify our theoretical findings via numerical experiments and provide insights.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/70 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nThis is visible in Figure 4(b) where blue norm curve levels off. Real experiments. To study softmax sparsity and the evolution of attention weights throughout training, we train a vision transformer (ViT-base) model [23] from scratch, utilizing the CIFAR10 dataset [24] for 400 epochs with fixed learning rate $3 \\times 10^{-3}$. ViT tokenizes an image into $16 \\times 16$ patches, thus, its softmax attention maps can be easily visualized. We examine the average attention map - associated with the [CLS] token - computed from all 12 attention heads within the model. Figure 6 provides a visual representation of the resulting attention weights $(16 \\times 16$ grids) corresponding to the original patch locations within the image. During the initial epochs of training, the attention weights are randomly distributed and exhibit a dense pattern. However, as the training progresses, the attention map gradually becomes sparser and the attention mechanism begins to concentrate on fewer salient patches within the image that possess distinct features that aid classification. This illustrates the evolution of attention from a random initial state to a more focused and sparse representation. These salient patches highlighted by attention conceptually corresponds to the optimal tokens within our theory. We quantify the sparsity of the attention map via a soft-sparsity measure, denoted by $\\widehat{\\operatorname{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})$ where $\\boldsymbol{s}$ is the softmax probability vector. The soft-sparsity is computed as the ratio of the $\\ell_{1}-$ norm to the squared $\\ell_{2}-$ norm, defined as $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(\\boldsymbol{s})=\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|_{1} /\\|\\boldsymbol{s}\\|^{2}$. $\\widehat{\\mathrm{nnz}}(s)$ takes values between 1 to $T=256$ and a smaller value indicates a sparser vector. Also note that $\\|s\\|_{1}=\\sum_{t=1}^{T} s_{t}=1$. Together with sparsity, Figure 7 also displays the Frobenius norm of the combined key-query matrix $\\boldsymbol{W}$ of the last attention layer over epochs. The theory suggests that the increase in sparsity is associated with the growth of attention weights - which converge directionally. The results in Figure 7 align with the theory, demonstrating the progressive sparsification of the attention map as $\\|\\boldsymbol{W}\\|_{F}$ grows. Transient optimization dynamics and the influence of the loss function. Theorem 2 shows that the asymptotic direction of gradient descent is determined by $\\boldsymbol{p}^{m m \\star}$. However, it is worth noting that transient dynamics can exhibit bias towards certain input examples and their associated optimal tokens. We illustrate this idea in Fig 5(a), which displays the trajectories of the gradients for different scores and loss functions. We consider two optimal tokens ( $\\star$ ) with scores $\\gamma_{1}=1$ and $\\gamma_{2}=C$, where $C$ varies. For our analysis, we examine the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ and the logistic loss $\\ell(x)=\\log \\left(1+e^{-x}\\right)$. In essence, as $C$ increases, we can observe that the correlation loss $\\ell(x)=-x$ exhibits a bias towards the token with a high score, while the logistic loss is biased towards the token with a low score. The underlying reason for this behavior can be observed from the gradients of individual inputs: $\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})=\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{K}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{p}) \\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{v}$, where $\\mathbb{S}^{\\prime}(\\cdot)$ represents the derivative of the softmax function and $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime}:=\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(Y_{i} \\cdot \\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}\\left(\\boldsymbol{X}_{i} \\boldsymbol{p}\\right)\\right)$. Assuming that $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (approximately) selects the optimal tokens, this\nsimplifies to $\\ell_{i}^{\\prime} \\approx \\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\left(\\gamma_{i}\\right)\\right| \\cdot \\gamma_{i}$. With the correlation loss, $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=1$, resulting in $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\boldsymbol{\\gamma}_{i}$, meaning that a larger score induces a larger gradient. On the other hand, the logistic loss behaves similarly to the exponential loss under separable data, i.e., $\\left|\\ell^{\\prime}\\right|=e^{-x} /\\left(1+e^{-x}\\right) \\approx e^{-x}$. Consequently, $\\left\\|\\nabla \\mathcal{L}_{i}(\\boldsymbol{p})\\right\\| \\propto \\gamma_{i} e^{-\\gamma_{i}} \\approx e^{-\\gamma_{i}}$, indicating that a smaller score leads to a larger gradient. These observations explain the empirical behavior we observe. ## 5 Related Work\n\nImplicit Regularization. The implicit bias of gradient descent in classification tasks involving separable data has been extensively examined by [22, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29]. These works typically use logistic loss or, more generally, exponentially-tailed losses to make connections to margin maximization. These results are also extended to non-separable data by [30, 31, 21]. Furthermore, there have been notable investigations into the implicit bias in regression problems/losses utilizing techniques such as mirror descent $[32,25,33,34,35,36]$. In addition, several papers have explored the implicit bias of stochastic gradient descent [37,38, 39, 40, 41, 42], as well as adaptive and momentum-based methods [43, 44, 45, 46]. Although there are similarities between our optimization approach for $\\boldsymbol{v}$ and existing works, the optimization of $\\boldsymbol{p}$ stands out as significantly different. Firstly, our optimization problem is nonconvex, introducing new challenges and complexities. Secondly, it necessitates the introduction of novel concepts such as locally-optimal tokens and requires a fresh analysis specifically tailored to the cones surrounding them. Attention Mechanism. Transformers, introduced by [6], revolutionized the field of NLP and machine translation, with earlier works on self-attention by [47, 48, 49, 50]. Self-attention differs from traditional models like MLPs and CNNs by leveraging global interactions for feature representations, showing exceptional empirical performance. However, the underlying mechanisms and learning processes of the attention layer remain unknown. Recent studies such as [51, 52, 53, 54, 23] have focused on specific aspects like representing sparse functions, convex-relaxations, and expressive power. In contrast to our nonconvex (ERM), [52] studies self-attention with linear activation instead of softmax, while [53] approximates softmax using a linear operation with unit simplex constraints. Their main objective is to derive convex reformulations for ERM-based training problem. [55, 56] have developed initial results to characterize the optimization and generalization dynamics of attention. [17] is another closely related work where the authors analyze the same attention model (ERM) as us. Specifically, they jointly optimize $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ for three gradient iterations for a contextual dataset model. However, all of these works make stringent assumptions on the data, namely, tokens are tightly clusterable or can be clearly split into clear relevant and irrelevant sets. Additionally [56] requires assumptions on initialization and [55] considers a simplified attention structure where the attention matrix is not directly parameterized with respect to the input. Our work links attention models to hard-margin SVM problems and pioneers the study of gradient descent's implicit bias in these models. ## 6 Discussion\n\nWe have provided a thorough optimization-theoretic characterization of the fundamental attention model $f(\\boldsymbol{X})=\\boldsymbol{v}^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{X}^{\\top} \\mathbb{S}(\\boldsymbol{X} \\boldsymbol{W} \\boldsymbol{p})$ by formally connecting it to max-margin problems. We first established the convergence of gradient descent on $\\boldsymbol{p}$ (or equivalently $\\boldsymbol{W}$ ) in isolation. We also explored joint convergence of $(\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p})$ via regularization path which revealed surprising implicit biases such as (10). These findings motivate several exciting avenues for future research. An immediate open problem is characterizing the (local) convergence of gradient descent for joint optimization of ( $\\boldsymbol{v}, \\boldsymbol{p}$ ). Another major direction is to extend similar analysis to study self-attention layer (4) or to allow for multiple tunable tokens (where $\\boldsymbol{p}$ becomes a matrix). Either setting will enrich the problem by allowing the attention to discover multiple hyperplanes to separate tokens. While our convergence guarantees apply when tokens are separable, it would be interesting to characterize the non-separable geometry by leveraging results developed for logistic regression analysis [31, 22]. Ideas from such earlier results can also be useful for characterizing the non-asymptotic/transient dynamics of how gradient descent aligns with the max-margin direction. Overall, we believe that max-margin token selection is a fundamental characteristic of attention mechanism and the theory developed in this work lays the groundwork of these future extensions. ## Acknowledgements\n\nThis work was supported by the NSF grants CCF-2046816 and CCF-2212426, Google Research Scholar award, and Army Research Office grant W911NF2110312.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

The primary challenge lies in the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length, leading to substantial computational time and memory requirements [4, 41, 21]. To address this challenge, several approaches have been proposed. Longformer and BigBird utilize combinations of local, global, and sparse attention mechanisms to manage long contexts, reducing complexity to $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{n})$ [4, 41]. Reformer introduces locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to approximate attention by hashing similar tokens into the same buckets, thereby reducing computational complexity [21]. LSG Attention combines local, sparse, and global attention to effectively handle long contexts while minimizing computational overhead [9]. Despite these advancements, managing long-context interactions in practical applications remains a significant challenge. Recent work, such as LongLoRA, extends the context window of LLaMA2 from 4096 to 32768 tokens using Position Interpolation without substantial GPU or TPU resources\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-02.jpg?height=535&width=1381&top_left_y=404&top_left_x=365)\n\nFigure 1: Evaluation of SinkLoRA in bridging the accuracy gap between sparse shifted attention and full attention during supervised fine-tuning, while maintaining the memory efficiency of LongLoRA, which utilizes 1.8 times less memory compared to full fine-tuning. Furthermore, SinkLoRA retains the training speed of LongLoRA, being 1.8 times faster than full fine-tuning, due to the implementation of Sink Fixed Attention. The Llama2-7B models[37] are fine-tuned to various context lengths using Flash-Attention 2 [10] and DeepSpeed stage 2 [31], and are evaluated on the proof-pile test set [2] in terms of perplexity. ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_6def0ba0294d4b8e8c08g-02.jpg?height=349&width=1214&top_left_y=1644&top_left_x=484)\n\nFigure 2: Overview of the SinkLoRA fine-tuning process, incorporating Sink Fixed Attention (SFAttn).

Unlike LongLoRA, which retains the original standard self-attention during inference, SinkLoRA implements an optional KV cache compression method, $\\mathrm{H}^{2} \\mathrm{O}$ [43]. This extension enhances inference speed without significantly compromising performance. [6]. However, LongLoRA's efficiency is limited, achieving only $39 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention due to chaotic attention head structures and unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, we propose SinkLoRA, which offers better work partitioning. This includes the development of Sink Fixed Attention (SF-Attn), a segmentation and reassembly algorithm that, along with the global attention of \"sink attention tokens,\" achieves $92 \\%$ of the perplexity improvement of full attention after fine-tuning.

Our codes are released at https: //github.com/Glaciohound/LM-Infinite. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have recently advanced the state-of-the-art across various natural language processing tasks. They typically train on text segments of fewer than 4 K tokens (Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023), primarily due to the computational overhead quadratic in the input\n\n[^0]lengths of their Transformer architectures. As a result, they face challenges in generalization to inputs that are excessively longer than what they are trained on and suffer substantial deterioration in their performance (Tworkowski et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023a). This limits their applicability in tasks that require long-range contexts, such as encoding scientific articles, source code repository generation, or long-context dialogues. Extensive efforts have been devoted to addressing this length generalization challenge. Relative positional encodings such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021) and Alibi (Press et al., 2021) have been widely adopted by state-of-the-art LLMs, which calculate attention based on inter-token distance instead of absolute positions, hoping to avoid model failures due to unseen absolute position embeddings. Moreover, although applying a sliding-window attention pattern on the Transformer architecture can reduce the memory overhead (Beltagy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2023; Zaheer et al., 2020), they are not directly applicable to pre-trained models for length generalization without further training. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical investigation, $\\S 3$ pinpoints three primary factors underlying the length generalization failures: (1) the challenge of handling unseen distances among tokens, (2) the difficulty of attending to unseen numbers of tokens, and (3) implicitly encoded absolute positional information in initial tokens. These challenges can make LLMs' computational features, such as attention logits and hidden vectors, deviate from the training distribution, leading to failures of length generalization. Existing techniques fall short of addressing these underlying issues. Answering these challenges, we propose LMInfinite, a simple and effective method to enhance Transformer LLMs' capabilities for modeling long contextswithout parameter updates. LM-Infinite consists of two major components designed to alleviate the three factors above. (1) a $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$-shaped\nattention mask and (2) a ceiling on attention distances. The former forces the model to attend to only the beginning of the sequence and the most recent tokens within a pre-defined window, ignoring the rest. The latter component caps the relative distance values to the maximum the model has seen during training. It can also optionally re-introduce top- $k$ tokens in the middle to achieve better performance in some downstream tasks. LM-Infinite is highly flexible and applies to any off-the-shelf LLMs that use relative positional encoding and does not require any finetuning. Our experiments thoroughly evaluate LMInfinite on a variety of tasks and LLMs. On ArXiv (academic papers) and OpenWebText2 (Reddit posts) LM-Infinite facilitates zero-shot generalization for a wide range of LLMs to texts up to 200 M tokens, retaining the language modeling perplexity and generation quality. Without any parameter updates, LM-Infinite improves scores compared with the original model and truncation baselines on downstream tasks including Passkey Retrieval (Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023) and Qasper (Dasigi et al., 2021), which are two established benchmarks for long-context evaluation. We observe a $37.2 \\%$ gain on Passkey Retrieval and a $1.2 \\%$ gain on Qasper in the zero-shot setting. LM-Infinite also brings substantial efficiency improvements: it achieves $2.7 \\times$ decoding speed up and $7.5 \\times$ GPU memory saving over the original LLMs. ## 2 Background and Related Work\n\n### 2.1 Relative Positional Encodings\n\nThe traditional absolute positional encodings provide the absolute position information, usually with the help of a sequence of vectors called position embeddings (Vaswani et al., 2017; Kenton and Toutanova, 2019; Ke et al., 2020). They, however, have trouble when the model encounters unseen positions in inputs longer than the training length. Relative positional encodings aim to address the limitations of previous-generation positional encoding methods and consider the relative distances between tokens instead of the absolute positions. Examples include a learned attention logit bias in T5 (Raffel et al., 2020), Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019), Skyformer (Chen et al., 2021), Sketching (Chen et al., 2022) and Sandwich (Chi et al., 2023), a fixed linear attention decay (Press et al., 2021), and rotating query and key sequences based on distances such as RoPE (Su et al., 2021; Li et al.,\n2023), CAPE (Likhomanenko et al., 2021) and XPos (Sun et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2023). Despite some promising empirical evidence, length generalization failures are still widely observed when directly applied to large language models (Kaiokendev, 2023). In what follows, we briefly discuss two widely used relative positional encoding methods. They lay out the necessary context for our onward discussion and experiments. ## Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE; Su et al.,\n\n 2021) It rotates the key and query vectors based on positions before computing the inner product. Specifically, each vector $\\mathbf{x}$ (either key or query) is split into pairs of elements $\\left\\{\\left(x_{0}, x_{1}\\right),\\left(x_{2}, x_{3}\\right), \\cdots\\right\\}$, with each pair interpreted as a 2-dimensional vector. RoPE then rotates the vector $\\left(x_{a}, x_{a+1}\\right)$ of token $i$ with angle $\\theta_{a, i}=$ $i \\omega_{a}$, where $\\omega_{a}$ is the rotating speed associated with dimension pair $(a, a+1)$. After rotation, the 2 D vector becomes $\\left(\\begin{array}{cc}\\cos i \\omega_{a} & -\\sin i \\omega_{a} \\\\ \\sin i \\omega_{a} & \\cos i \\omega_{a}\\end{array}\\right)\\binom{x_{i}}{x_{i+1}}$. They show that the inner product between rotated query $\\mathbf{q}_{i}$ and rotated key $\\mathbf{k}_{j}$ is solely determined by $\\mathbf{q}_{i}, \\mathbf{k}_{j}$, and their relative distance $i-j$. We always have $i \\geq j$ due to the causal attention mask.AliBi (Press et al., 2021) It offsets all attention logits between tokens $i, j$ by a linear term $-m(i-$ $j)$ and become $\\mathbf{q}_{i}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{j}-m(i-j)$. To this end, the MPT-7B codes implement an offset matrix as an additive term in attention logits. ### 2.2 Efforts Towards Length Generalization\n\nIn light of generalization failures observed in LLMs, one straightforward solution is to finetune LLMs on longer text sequences (Chen et al., 2023a; Tworkowski et al., 2023; Tao et al., 2023; Kiyono et al., 2021; Anil et al., 2022). These approaches do not address the underlying causes of length generalization failures and require massive training resources. Other solutions propose to grant LLMs access to longer contexts without really reading them in full (Zhou et al., 2023; Bueno et al., 2022; Mohtashami and Jaggi, 2023; Yang et al., 2023). Augmenting LLMs with retrieval-based memories (Wu et al., 2021; Guu et al., 2020; Borgeaud et al., 2022; Khandelwal et al., 2019; Kaiser et al., 2016; Yogatama et al., 2021) also make LLMs applicable to a large database. These designs, however, usually need finetuning and are not directly compatible with the existing LLMs. Our work, in contrast, facilitates zero-shot length generalization. Another\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_11c5204fe0643ee0c075g-03.jpg?height=518&width=1578&top_left_y=244&top_left_x=234)\n\nFigure 1: We identify three factors underlying the length generalization failure in LLMs in $\\S 3$. (a) Factor 1: Unseen distances between tokens cause attention logits to explode. (b) Factor 2: An unseen number of tokens can cause attention entropy to increase beyond the training range as the length increases. (c) Factor 3: Starting few tokens occupy a distinct feature region and should not be discarded. The two blue regions at the upper center and lower right correspond to the initial tokens that are highly concentrated but also very far from later tokens. The lower-left region contains the thousands of overlapping dots corresponding to the later tokens. similar work (Ratner et al., 2023) increases context length with attention patterns without further training. However, it is limited to the in-context learning setting. ## 3 Why do Transformer LLMs Fail to Generalize to Long Contexts? Through a series of theoretical and experimental investigations, this section aims to identify the potential causes underlying current LLMs' failure in length generalization. Our discussion assumes Transformer-based LLMs that use relative positional encodings, as this design is widely adopted in today's LLMs (Touvron et al., 2023b; Team, 2023). We use Llama-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b), which is pre-trained with 4 K -length segments, for investigation. On sequences longer than the training length, we will show that the unseen inter-token distances, the increasing number of attended tokens, and the implicitly encoded position information of the starting tokens can all make certain computational features out of the training distribution. As deep models can be sensitive to input distribution shifts, these factors need to be handled for LLMs to generalize to unseen lengths. Factor 1: challenges in handling unseen distances among tokens With relative positional encoding, the impact of positions on the attention weight between two tokens depends solely on their relative distance. As the sequence length grows exceedingly long, some distance values will surpass those seen during training. We make the following informal theoretical claim:\nTheorem 1. (Informal) For an attention mechanism using relative positional encoding, the attention logits must explode to infinities to differentiate previously unseen distances apart as the sequence length increases. The formal theorem and its proof can be found in Appendix C. We also empirically verify this on Llama-2 on the ArXiv dataset truncated down to 8 K length. We extract the attention logits of all attention heads and their maximum attention logits on different sequence lengths in Figure 1(a). It shows the average and variance among attention heads. We see that the attention logits increase to substantially larger values when the sequence length exceeds the training length of 4 K . To mitigate this issue, we conjecture that it may help to cap the relative distance values to the maximum that the model has seen during training (i.e., a distance ceiling). However, as we will see from the proposition below, addressing logit explosion leads to another challenge. ## Factor 2: attending to unseen numbers of tokens\n\n On longer sequences, tokens at later positions must distribute attention weights across a larger context. We then make the following claim that, if attention logits are bounded but the number of tokens to attend to is not limited, it can cause the attention entropy to increase beyond the training range:Proposition 1. If the attention logits are bounded, as the sequence becomes longer, the attention entropy grows to infinity. A formal statement as well as the proof can be\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_11c5204fe0643ee0c075g-04.jpg?height=620&width=786&top_left_y=227&top_left_x=224)\n(a) Proposed Solution: LM-Infinite\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_11c5204fe0643ee0c075g-04.jpg?height=606&width=789&top_left_y=228&top_left_x=1022)\n(b) A Conceptual Model of Relative Positional Attention\n\nFigure 2: (a) LM-Infinite is a plug-and-play solution for various LLMs, consisting of a $\\boldsymbol{\\Lambda}$-shaped mask and a distance ceiling during attention.\n```\n\n#### 5. Efficient Attention via Control Variates (Avg. Score: 0.68)\n\n*Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Chong Wang, Lingpeng Kong*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Learning Representations (2023)\t**Cited by** 15  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** Random-feature-based attention (RFA) is an efficient approximation of softmax attention with linear runtime and space complexity. However, the approximation gap between RFA and conventional softmax attention is not well studied. Built upon previous progress of RFA, we characterize this gap through the lens of control variates and show that RFA can be decomposed into a sum of multiple control variate estimators for each element in the sequence. This new framework reveals that exact softmax attention can be recovered from RFA by manipulating each control variate. Besides, it allows us to develop a more flexible form of control variates, resulting in a novel attention mechanism that significantly reduces the approximation gap while maintaining linear complexity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art efficient attention mechanisms on both vision and language tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 52/52 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\n2021). ## E. 4 EXPERIMENTAL SETTINGS OF EFFICIENCY COMPARISON\n\nFor the simulation experiment conducted in $\\S 5.3$ we adopt the same transformer architecture across all attention variants.

Besides, in our ablation study, the efficiency metrics reported in Table 6 and Table 7 are evaluated under the same setup used during training. Remark on Modeling Short Sequences. Unfortunately, similar to most previous efficient attention baselines, EVA also runs slower than softmax attention under shorter sequences (e.g., length of 128 or 256), but it soon catches up in running speed, and the reduction of memory consumption is still significant. Besides, in short-sequence settings (such as the case of DeiT-Tiny/Small with sequences of 196 tokens), EVA often performs on par with or better than conventional softmax attention (see Table 1, whereas most previous attention variants usually perform much worse. This implies EVA can achieve a better trade-off between efficiency and quality: for short sequences, EVA is possible to achieve stronger performance competitive with softmax attention (despite in longer running time); while for long sequences, EVA can be run much faster with less memory. Comparison to Memory-efficient Attention Mechanisms. In this section, we conduct an empirical efficiency comparison between efficient approximate attention methods and FlashAttention, one of the memory-efficient attention mechanisms (Rabe \\& Staats, 2021, Dao et al., 2022) with optimized memory accesses. FlashAttention computes the exact softmax attention in an online manner without materializing the full attention matrix, achieving linear memory complexity with respect to sequence lengths; besides, both runtime and memory usage are further improved by minimizing IO accesses. We benchmark different attention modules on one NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 GPU, where we measure the memory usage and runtime of running a single attention block, consisting of 8 attention heads with 512 embedding dimension size, for both a forward and backward pass. As shown in Figure 2, we observe that FlashAttention achieves significant memory usage reduction for softmax attention approximation and even consumes much less memory than all considered approximate baselines under all sequence lengths. In terms of runtime, we notice that FlashAttention runs faster than most attention baselines under sequence lengths less than 2048 despite scaling quadratically, but EVA, along with other more efficient approximate variants, begin to catch up at longer sequence lengths. This implies that the quadratic computational costs of softmax attention still bottleneck its runtime performance, aligning with one of the main findings in Dao et al. (2022). According to this empirical study, we observe that FlashAttention offers a general and effective technique to speed up softmax attention; since many approximate variants (including EVA) exhibit a similar formulation to softmax attention (e.g., Equation 16), we expect they can also benefit from the optimized online softmax calculation technique and memory accesses of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). ## F EXPERIMENTS on Long RANGE ArEnA\n\nLong Range Arena (LRA; Tay et al. 2021) is a lightweight benchmark that assesses the ability of efficient attention methods to model long sequences in diverse domains. We follow the same hyper-parameter setup as Xiong et al. (2021b) to re-evaluate all attention baselines and report the\n\nTable 15: Classification accuracy (\\%) on LRA benchmark with different efficient attention mechanisms. | Model | ListOps | Text | Retrieval | Image | Pathfinder | Avg. |\n| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |\n| Softmax | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 6}$ | 64.91 | 80.70 | 40.61 | 68.29 | 58.63 |\n| Linformer | 38.21 | 53.91 | 77.66 | 39.40 | 66.44 | 55.12 |\n| Performer | 29.84 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 3 0}$ | 77.70 | 38.29 | 66.39 | 55.50 |\n| Reformer | 27.12 | 63.90 | 78.08 | 42.40 | 51.90 | 52.69 |\n| Scatterbrain | 38.21 | 64.04 | 77.83 | 42.51 | 60.62 | 56.64 |\n| Combiner | 38.26 | 63.98 | 81.47 | 42.80 | 55.94 | 56.49 |\n| LARA | 37.10 | 64.62 | 80.82 | 38.99 | 68.96 | 58.10 |\n| Nystr\u00f6mformer | 38.46 | $\\mathbf{6 5 . 2 8}$ | 80.44 | 39.71 | 68.98 | 58.57 |\n| Local | 38.46 | 63.70 | 80.71 | 42.25 | 68.46 | 58.72 |\n| Long-short | 38.56 | 63.46 | $\\mathbf{8 1 . 7 3}$ | 40.54 | $\\mathbf{7 1 . 2 8}$ | 59.11 |\n| EVA | $\\mathbf{3 8 . 6 1}$ | 64.31 | 80.21 | $\\mathbf{4 3 . 2 4}$ | 70.90 | $\\mathbf{5 9 . 4 5}$ |\n\ncomparison in Table 15. We observe that EVA largely improves previous RFA methods such as Performer (Choromanski et al. 2021) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), and performs competitively with full softmax attention. Notably, EVA even achieves better average results over all tasks, with higher accuracy on Image and Pathfinder benchmarks, suggesting its capability of capturing long-term dependencies. For LRA benchmark, we set all attention-specific hyper-parameters to 128 (e.g., the number of landmarks in Nystr\u00f6mformer (Xiong et al. 2021b) and LARA (Zheng et al., 2022b), the window size in local attention and Combiner (Ren et al., 2021), etc.). We set $|E|=128$ and $C=64$ by default for EVA without any further tuning and find this setup works well. ## G Connections to Other AtTEntion Mechanisms\n\n## G. 1 RFA, SoftmAx AtTEntion, And EVA\n\nAs mentioned in our main text, one of the main contributions of this work is to develop a more general framework that bridges RFA and conventional softmax attention. To see how EVA (Equation 13) achieves this goal formally, note that if either $|E|=M$ or $C=M$, EVA would be equivalent to standard softmax attention; while if we set $|E|=0$ and $C=1$, EVA would recover vanilla RFA. ## G. 2 CONNECTIONS TO LARA\n\nNotably, EVA and LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) are two efficient attention mechanisms that are both built upon the self-normalized importance sampling (SNIS) formulation of RFAs. LARA (Zheng et al. 2022b) puts the main focus on the proposal distribution used in SNIS and tries to design importance sampling proposals that are closer to the true underlying distribution. The proposed usage of multiple proposals further improves the estimation quality of SNIS and achieves strong empirical performance while still keeping linear complexity. In contrast to LARA, in this work we do not focus on the design choice of proposals used in importance sampling but aim to generalize the SNIS formulation further via control variates. As demonstrated in \\$3.2 our theory clearly delineates how the gap between such SNIS estimation and softmax attention can be closed by manipulating control variates. Since LARA and RFA are both SNIS estimators (their main difference lies in the choice of proposal distributions), our generalization also applies to LARA. To summarize, compared with LARA, EVA is a more general framework and improves conventional RFA from an orthogonal perspective. ## G. 3 Connections to Clustered AtTEntion\n\nClustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) is an efficient attention mechanism that first clusters the set of queries into multiple groups, computes the mean centroid of each group, and then performs attention between query centroids and original key-value pairs. This framework is fast and effective and enjoys well-bounded approximation error. Clustered attention and EVA share some similarities in two aspects. First, both of them adopt the partitioning technique to reduce the computational complexity while remaining effective; and secondly, both observe that the efficient attention mechanism can be improved by refining the approximation over specific elements. For instance, clustered attention can be improved (Vyas et al., 2020) by selecting top- $k$ key-value pairs that are most relevant to each centroid and then refining the approximation by recomputing attention weights over these keys using original queries; while EVA notices that we can directly employ the optimal control variate coefficient for a subset of key-value pairs $(m \\in E)$ while still remaining efficient, which yields a more accurate approximation. Nevertheless, our main technical contribution is to develop a control variate formulation in the context of RFA and demonstrate that how RFA can be further improved locally. On the other hand, while clustered attention (Vyas et al. 2020) clusters queries, EVA partitions key-value pairs. This property makes EVA more amenable to the case of autoregressive language modeling since we do not impose clustering structures over the query set, and thus the causal relation among queries can be well maintained. ## G. 4 CONNECTIONS TO COMBINER\n\nCombiner (Ren et al. 2021) is a recently proposed attention mechanism that also partitions the sequence into chunks combined with local attention. The key difference between EVA and Combiner is the motivation, where Combiner introduces a structured factorization over the attention probability distribution, while our approach is built from the control variate perspective. ## G. 5 CONNECTIONS TO SCATTERbRAIN\n\nIn this section, we show that Scatterbrain (Chen et al., 2021a) can be cast as a special case of our framework EVA, although they are proposed based on quite different motivations. A Brief Review of Scatterbrain. Scatterbrain (Chen et al, 2021a) notes that sparse attention and RFA can approximate sharp and flat regions of the softmax attention matrix well, respectively. Based on this insight, Scatterbrain is proposed to first compute a Performer approximation to softmax attention and then cancel out the approximation error on critical regions via a sparse mechanism. Specifically, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) defines a sparse matrix $\\mathbf{S} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times M}$ ) so that for each $(n, m) \\in \\mathbf{S}$ that indexes a non-zero entry. For notational simplicity, we also denote $\\operatorname{Supp}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{(i, j) \\mid S_{i j} \\neq 0\\right\\}$ and $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})=\\left\\{m \\mid S_{n m} \\neq 0\\right\\}$. With random features $\\phi(\\cdot, \\cdot)$ defined in Appendix A we let\n\n$$\nS_{n m}=\\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m}\\right)-\\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)\n$$\n\nWe then add it back to the approximate output:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\ny_{n}^{\\prime} & =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\mathbf{S V} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m=1}^{M} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} S_{n m^{\\prime}} \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}} \\\\\n& =\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThe sparse mechanism can be thought of as modeling the error due to RFA and eliminating it on the support of $\\mathbf{S}$. After the correction step, Scatterbrain further adds a post-hoc normalization step to obtain a normalized attention output:\n\n$$\ny_{n}=\\frac{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m}+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}_{m^{\\prime}}}{\\sum_{m \\notin \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)^{\\top} \\boldsymbol{\\phi}\\left(\\mathbf{k}_{m}, \\boldsymbol{\\omega}\\right)+\\sum_{m^{\\prime} \\in \\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})} \\exp \\left(\\mathbf{q}_{n}^{\\top} \\mathbf{k}_{m^{\\prime}}\\right)}\n$$\n\nIntuitively, Scatterbrain (Chen et al. 2021a) produces accurate approximation in the support of the sparse matrix and remains the random feature approximation outside the support. Scatterbrain is a Special Case of EVA. For notational convenience, we denote $E:=\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$. According to Proposition 1, suppose we employ optimal coefficients $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}_{m}$ for all entries in $\\operatorname{Supp}_{n}(\\mathbf{S})$, and use the same coefficient $\\widehat{\\boldsymbol{\\beta}}$ for all the remaining entries (in other words, we let $C=1$ and the whole index set is only partitioned into two subsets $\\{E,[M] \\backslash E\\})$.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis\n\n### Integration of HyperNetworks and LoRA into MetaLearner GAU\n\n**Dynamic Low-Rank Weight Generation:**\n\n- **Concept:** By designing the MetaLearner GAU as a HyperNetwork, it can generate low-rank adaptation matrices (as in LoRA) dynamically based on the input data.\n- **Benefit:** This allows the model to adjust its parameters in response to different inputs, enhancing adaptability without significantly increasing the number of trainable parameters.\n\n**Advantages:**\n\n- **Parameter Efficiency:** LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by introducing low-rank matrices. When combined with HyperNetworks, we can generate these matrices dynamically, tailoring them to each input or task.\n- **Computational Efficiency:** Low-rank matrices reduce computational complexity, and since LoRA introduces no inference-time overhead, the model remains efficient during deployment.\n- **Adaptability:** HyperNetworks enable the model to generate parameter updates conditioned on input data, improving performance across diverse contexts.\n\n### Implementation Strategies\n\n**Modifying the MetaLearner GAU:**\n\n- **Design:** Implement the MetaLearner as a HyperNetwork that takes the input embeddings and generates the low-rank adaptation matrices for selected layers.\n- **Selectivity:** Focus on adapting specific layers (e.g., attention layers or feed-forward networks) that have the most significant impact on model performance. This balances efficiency and effectiveness.\n\n**Addressing Computational Overhead:**\n\n- **Efficient Training Techniques:** Utilize techniques such as parameter-sharing and sparse low-rank adaptations (SoRA) to minimize additional computational costs.\n- **Regularization and Pruning:** Implement methods like AB-LoRA to estimate the importance of LoRA ranks and prune redundant ones dynamically, reallocating resources to more important parameters.\n\n**Training Stability and Scalability:**\n\n- **Initialization:** Initialize the HyperNetwork with pre-trained weights or through careful pretraining to ensure stable convergence.\n- **Scalability:** The combined approach scales well to large models, as the parameter efficiency keeps the number of additional parameters manageable even as the base model size increases.\n\n### Potential Benefits and Impact\n\n- **Enhanced Efficiency:** Reduces the number of parameters that need to be fine-tuned, saving memory and computational resources.\n- **Improved Performance:** Dynamic parameter generation allows the model to adapt more effectively to varying inputs, potentially improving perplexity and downstream task performance.\n- **Scalability:** The approach is suitable for large-scale models, addressing efficiency concerns in training and inference of large language models.\n\n## 4.

Self-attention Networks Localize When QK-eigenspectrum Concentrates (Avg. Score: 0.20)\n\n*Han Bao, Ryuichiro Hataya, Ryo Karakida*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices is characterized and it is revealed that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n**Abstract:** The self-attention mechanism prevails in modern machine learning. It has an interesting functionality of adaptively selecting tokens from an input sequence by modulating the degree of attention localization, which many researchers speculate is the basis of the powerful model performance but complicates the underlying mechanism of the learning dynamics. In recent years, mainly two arguments have connected attention localization to the model performances. One is the rank collapse, where the embedded tokens by a self-attention block become very similar across different tokens, leading to a less expressive network. The other is the entropy collapse, where the attention probability approaches non-uniform and entails low entropy, making the learning dynamics more likely to be trapped in plateaus. These two failure modes may apparently contradict each other because the rank and entropy collapses are relevant to uniform and non-uniform attention, respectively. To this end, we characterize the notion of attention localization by the eigenspectrum of query-key parameter matrices and reveal that a small eigenspectrum variance leads attention to be localized. Interestingly, the small eigenspectrum variance prevents both rank and entropy collapse, leading to better model expressivity and trainability.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/27 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\n[19] Noci, L., Anagnostidis, S., Biggio, L., Orvieto, A., Singh, S.

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nGalanti, T. and Wolf, L.

In the pursuit of lower costs, we investigate simple MLP-based architectures. We find that existing architectures such as MLPMixer, which achieves token mixing through a static MLP applied to each feature independently, are too detached from the inductive biases required for natural language understanding. In this paper, we propose a simple variant, HyperMixer, which forms the token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks. Empirically, we demonstrate that our model performs better than alternative MLP-based models, and on par with Transformers. In contrast to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves these results at substantially lower costs in terms of processing time, training data, and hyperparameter tuning.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/36 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nDavid Ha, Andrew Dai, and Quoc V Le. 2016.

Originally designed for continuous signals, SSMs have shown superior performance on a plethora of tasks, in vision and audio; however, SSMs still lag Transformer performance in Language Modeling tasks. In this work, we propose a hybrid layer named Block-State Transformer (BST), that internally combines an SSM sublayer for long-range contextualization, and a Block Transformer sublayer for short-term representation of sequences. We study three different, and completely parallelizable, variants that integrate SSMs and block-wise attention. We show that our model outperforms similar Transformer-based architectures on language modeling perplexity and generalizes to longer sequences. In addition, the Block-State Transformer demonstrates more than tenfold increase in speed at the layer level compared to the Block-Recurrent Transformer when model parallelization is employed.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/28 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1805.04623, 2018.

State-space models (SSMs) offer a promising alternative due to their linear decoding efficiency and high parallelizability during training. However, existing SSMs often rely on seemingly ad hoc linear recurrence designs. In this work, we explore SSM design through the lens of online learning, conceptualizing SSMs as meta-modules for specific online learning problems. This approach links SSM design to formulating precise online learning objectives, with state transition rules derived from optimizing these objectives. Based on this insight, we introduce a novel deep SSM architecture based on the implicit update for optimizing an online regression objective. Our experimental results show that our models outperform state-of-the-art SSMs, including the Mamba model, on standard sequence modeling benchmarks and language modeling tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/24 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1711.05101, 2017.

Our main focus is int8 as GPU support for float8 is rare, though we also analyze float8 training through simulation. While SwitchBack proves effective for float8, we show that standard techniques are also successful if the network is trained and initialized so that large feature magnitudes are discouraged, which we accomplish via layer-scale initialized with zeros. 2) For stability, we analyze loss spikes and find they consistently occur 1-8 iterations after the squared gradients become under-estimated by their AdamW second moment estimator. As a result, we recommend an AdamW-Adafactor hybrid which avoids loss spikes when training a CLIP ViT-Huge model and outperforms gradient clipping at the scales we test.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 2. Generating Training Data with Language Models: Towards Zero-Shot Language Understanding\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Yu Meng, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper presents a simple approach that uses both types of PLMs for fully zero-shot learning of NLU tasks without requiring any task-specific data: a unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a bidirectionalPLM.\n\n**Abstract:** Pretrained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in various natural language processing tasks: Unidirectional PLMs (e.g., GPT) are well known for their superior text generation capabilities; bidirectional PLMs (e.g., BERT) have been the prominent choice for natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. While both types of models have achieved promising few-shot learning performance, their potential for zero-shot learning has been underexplored. In this paper, we present a simple approach that uses both types of PLMs for fully zero-shot learning of NLU tasks without requiring any task-specific data: A unidirectional PLM generates class-conditioned texts guided by prompts, which are used as the training data for fine-tuning a bidirectional PLM. With quality training data selected based on the generation probability and regularization techniques (label smoothing and temporal ensembling) applied to the fine-tuning stage for better generalization and stability, our approach demonstrates strong performance across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark (e.g., 72.3/73.8 on MNLI-m/mm and 92.8 on SST-2), significantly outperforming zero-shot prompting methods and achieving even comparable results to strong few-shot approaches using 32 training samples per class.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 186  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 3.

Namely, their performance varies substantially for different target languages and is the weakest where needed the most: for low-resource languages distant to the source language. One remedy is few-shot transfer (FS-XLT), where leveraging only a few task-annotated instances in the target language(s) may yield sizable performance gains. However, FS-XLT also succumbs to large variation, as models easily overfit to the small datasets. In this work, we present a systematic study focused on a spectrum of FS-XLT fine-tuning regimes, analyzing key properties such as effectiveness, (in)stability, and modularity. We conduct extensive experiments on both higher-level (NLI, paraphrasing) and lower-level tasks (NER, POS), presenting new FS-XLT strategies that yield both improved and more stable FS-XLT across the board. Our findings challenge established FS-XLT methods: e.g., we propose to replace sequential fine-tuning with joint fine-tuning on source and target language instances, offering consistent gains with different number of shots (including resource-rich scenarios). We also show that further gains can be achieved with multi-stage FS-XLT training in which joint multilingual fine-tuning precedes the bilingual source-target specialization.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 28  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 4. Improving Stability of Fine-Tuning Pretrained Language Models via Component-Wise Gradient Norm Clipping\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Chenghao Yang, Xuezhe Ma*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components, which achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.\n\n**Abstract:** Fine-tuning over large pretrained language models (PLMs) has established many state-of-the-art results. Despite its superior performance, such fine-tuning can be unstable, resulting in significant variance in performance and potential risks for practical applications. Previous works have attributed such instability to the catastrophic forgetting problem in the top layers of PLMs, which indicates iteratively fine-tuning layers in a top-down manner is a promising solution. In this paper, we first point out that this method does not always work out due to the different convergence speeds of different layers/modules. Inspired by this observation, we propose a simple component-wise gradient norm clipping method to adjust the convergence speed for different components. Experiment results demonstrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in terms of generalization performance, convergence speed, and training stability.

Tuning Language Models as Training Data Generators for Augmentation-Enhanced Few-Shot Learning\n\n*From Search Query: training stability hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Yu Meng, Martin Michalski, Jiaxin Huang, Yu Zhang, T. Abdelzaher, Jiawei Han*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work first tunes an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then uses it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set, achieving an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few- shot learning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent studies have revealed the intriguing few-shot learning ability of pretrained language models (PLMs): They can quickly adapt to a new task when fine-tuned on a small amount of labeled data formulated as prompts, without requiring abundant task-specific annotations. Despite their promising performance, most existing few-shot approaches that only learn from the small training set still underperform fully supervised training by nontrivial margins. In this work, we study few-shot learning with PLMs from a different perspective: We first tune an autoregressive PLM on the few-shot samples and then use it as a generator to synthesize a large amount of novel training samples which augment the original training set. To encourage the generator to produce label-discriminative samples, we train it via weighted maximum likelihood where the weight of each token is automatically adjusted based on a discriminative meta-learning objective. A classification PLM can then be fine-tuned on both the few-shot and the synthetic samples with regularization for better generalization and stability. Our approach FewGen achieves an overall better result across seven classification tasks of the GLUE benchmark than existing few-shot learning methods, improving no-augmentation methods by 5+ average points, and outperforming augmentation methods by 3+ average points.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 35  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using hypernetworks, focusing on training stability, dynamic parameter generation, and balancing stability with adaptability, here are some key insights and techniques from the provided sources and additional context:\n\n## Training Stability Techniques for Hypernetworks\n\n### Hyper LoRAs and HyperAT\n- The use of Hyper LoRAs, as described in the HyperDet and HyperAT papers, involves generating LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights using hypernetworks. This approach enhances training stability by allowing the model to adapt to different tasks without fine-tuning the entire network. Hyper LoRAs reduce the number of parameters to be tuned, thus improving computational efficiency and inference speed.\n- HyperAT specifically addresses adversarial robustness by using a shared hypernetwork to generate defensive LoRA modules. This method ensures that the model can learn multiple adversarial training methods simultaneously without suffering from catastrophic forgetting, thereby enhancing stability and robustness.\n\n## Methods for Ensuring Stable Convergence in Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n### Conditional Diffusion Models\n- Conditional diffusion models can be used to generate parameters dynamically based on specific tasks. These models learn to transform random noise into meaningful parameter distributions, ensuring that the generated parameters are optimized for the task at hand. This approach can help in achieving stable convergence by generating parameters that are tailored to the conditions provided.\n\n### Hypernetworks with Embeddings\n- Hypernetworks can generate parameters based on task embeddings, layer embeddings, and position embeddings. This method, as seen in HyperDet, allows the hypernetwork to learn common knowledge across different tasks, enhancing the model\u2019s generalization capability and stability.\n\n## Techniques for Balancing Stability and Adaptability in Neural Networks\n\n### Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\n- LoRA is an efficient method for fine-tuning large models by constraining parameter updates within two low-rank matrices. This technique reduces the number of parameters to be tuned, preserving pre-trained knowledge while improving computational efficiency. It balances stability by keeping the original network structure frozen and adaptability by allowing task-specific fine-tuning.\n\n### Hypernetworks and Model Merging\n- HyperAT's approach of merging parameters generated by different specialist hypernetworks enhances the model's robustness and adaptability. This method ensures that the model can learn from multiple adversarial training methods without introducing excessive computational overhead, balancing stability and adaptability.\n\n### Dynamic Adaptation and Robustness to Noise\n- Diffusion models, particularly those used in continual learning, can adapt to new data without forgetting previously learned information. They handle noisy data effectively, which is crucial for real-world applications where data quality may vary. This dynamic adaptation mechanism helps in maintaining stability while adapting to new tasks or data.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can design autoregressive language models that are not only efficient and adaptable but also stable during training and inference. The use of hypernetworks with LoRA, conditional diffusion models, and careful balancing of stability and adaptability through model merging and dynamic adaptation can significantly enhance the overall performance of these models.\n",

Part of their success is a result of a parallelizable training scheme over the input length. This improves training times and allows for larger volumes of data which makes these models amenable to pretraining (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019). Therefore, many current state-of-the-art models are fine-tuned extensions of large pretrained Transformers (Bommasani et al., 2021). However, these models come at a significant computational cost. They require considerable resources for pretraining and fine-tuning, which induces high energy consumption (Strubell et al., 2019) and limits access to research (Bommasani et al., 2021). Subsequently, Schwartz et al. (2020)\n\n[^0]argue the need for \"Green $A I$ \". They propose a cost evaluation of a result $R$ as following:\n$$\n\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto E \\cdot D \\cdot H\n$$\nwhere $E$ is the computational cost measured in floating point operations (FPO) of a single example, $D$ is the dataset size, and $H$ is the number of hyperparameter configurations required during tuning. To achieve a cost reduction, this paper proposes a simpler alternative to Transformers. We take inspiration from the computer vision community, which has recently seen a surge of research on Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). Most prominently, MLPMixer (Tolstikhin et al., 2021), which is a simple architecture based on two MLPs: one for token mixing and one for feature mixing. However, the token mixing MLP learns a fixed-size set of position-specific mappings, arguably making MLPMixer's architecture too detached from the inductive biases needed for natural language understanding, in contrast to Transformers (Henderson, 2020). In this paper, we propose a simple variant, $H y$ perMixer (Figure 1), which creates a token mixing MLP dynamically using hypernetworks (Ha et al., 2016). This variant is more appropriate, as it learns to generate a variable-size set of mappings in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism in Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017). In contrast to Transformer's quadratic complexity, HyperMixer's complexity is linear in the input length. This makes it a competitive alternative for training on longer inputs. Empirically, we demonstrate that HyperMixer works substantially better on natural language understanding tasks than the original MLPMixer and related alternatives. In comparison to Transformers, HyperMixer achieves competitive or improved results at a substantially lower cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R) \\propto$ $E \\cdot D \\cdot H$ : improved inference speeds (E), espe-\n\n## Model Layer\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_6b395d4a8d566ae2251dg-02.jpg?height=1030&width=1601&top_left_y=294&top_left_x=224)\n\nFigure 1: The figure outlines a general model layer consisting of a token mixing component and a feature mixing component (MLP). For token mixing, MLPMixer uses an MLP with a fixed size, maximum input length $N$ and position-specific weights. In contrast, HyperMixer generates an appropriately sized MLP based on the variable size of the input in a position-invariant way, similar to the attention mechanism. When using attention as token mixing the whole layer is equivalent to a Transformer encoder layer. cially for long inputs; favorable performance in the low-resource regime (D); and efficient tuning for hyperparameters (H). We attribute HyperMixer's success to its ability to approximate an attentionlike function. Further experiments on a synthetic task demonstrate that HyperMixer indeed learns to attend to tokens in similar pattern to the attention mechanism. In summary, our contributions can be enumerated as follows:\n\n1. A novel all-MLP model, HyperMixer, with inductive biases similar to Transformers. (Section: 2)\n2. A performance analysis of HyperMixer against alternative token mixing methods based on controlled experiments on the GLUE benchmark. (Section: 4.3)\n3. A comprehensive comparison of the cost $\\operatorname{Cost}(R)$ of HyperMixer and Transformers. (Sections: 4.4, 4.5, 4.6)\n4. An ablation demonstrating that HyperMixer learns attention patterns similar to Transformers. (Section: 4.7)\n\n## 2 Method\n\n### 2.1 Inductive Biases in NLP Models\n\nIn machine learning, the inductive biases of a model reflect implicit modeling assumptions which are key to facilitate learning and improve generalization on specific tasks. In NLP, well-known models with strong inductive biases include: recurrent neural networks (Elman, 1990), which assume the input to be a sequence; and recursive neural networks (Socher et al., 2013), which assume a treestructure. While both these inductive biases are reasonable, empirically, Transformers have been more successful in recent years. Furthermore, we reiterate the arguments of Henderson (2020) for inductive biases in language and apply them to our model design. Henderson (2020) attributes the Transformer's success to two concepts: vari-\nable binding and systematicity. Variable binding refers to the model's ability to represent multiple entities at once. This is arguably challenging in single-vector representations such as recurrent neural networks. However, Transformers represent each token with its own vector which accounts for variable binding as each token can be interpreted as an entity. Systematicity refers to the models ability to learn generalizable rules that reflect the structural relationship between entities (Fodor and Pylyshyn, 1988). Transformers achieve systematicity through the attention mechanism which is a learnable set of functions that determines the interaction between entities by matching query representations to key representations (as shown in Figure 1).\n```\n\n#### 2. Mogrifier LSTM (Avg. Score: 0.45)\n\n*Zihan Li, Fang Bai, Hongfu Zuo, Y. Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** Batteries (2023)\t**Cited by** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods and is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Lithium-ion battery health and remaining useful life (RUL) are essential indicators for reliable operation. Currently, most of the RUL prediction methods proposed for lithium-ion batteries use data-driven methods, but the length of training data limits data-driven strategies. To solve this problem and improve the safety and reliability of lithium-ion batteries, a Li-ion battery RUL prediction method based on iterative transfer learning (ITL) and Mogrifier long and short-term memory network (Mogrifier LSTM) is proposed. Firstly, the capacity degradation data in the source and target domain lithium battery historical lifetime experimental data are extracted, the sparrow search algorithm (SSA) optimizes the variational modal decomposition (VMD) parameters, and several intrinsic mode function (IMF) components are obtained by decomposing the historical capacity degradation data using the optimization-seeking parameters. The highly correlated IMF components are selected using the maximum information factor. Capacity sequence reconstruction is performed as the capacity degradation information of the characterized lithium battery, and the reconstructed capacity degradation information of the source domain battery is iteratively input into the Mogrifier LSTM to obtain the pre-training model; finally, the pre-training model is transferred to the target domain to construct the lithium battery RUL prediction model. The method\u2019s effectiveness is verified using CALCE and NASA Li-ion battery datasets, and the results show that the ITL-Mogrifier LSTM model has higher accuracy and better robustness and stability than other prediction methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/23 (Score: 0.68)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1704.06779, 2017.

Such Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs) learn to manipulate the contents of a finite memory and dynamically interact with it. We infer a memory capacity limitation of recent linearised softmax attention variants, and replace the purely additive outer products by a delta rule-like programming instruction, such that the FWP can more easily learn to correct the current mapping from keys to values. The FWP also learns to compute dynamically changing learning rates. We also propose a new kernel function to linearise attention which balances simplicity and effectiveness. We conduct experiments on synthetic retrieval problems as well as standard machine translation and language modelling tasks which demonstrate the benefits of our methods.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/47 (Score: 0.26)*\n\n```\nGalanti, T. and Wolf, L.

HyperNetwork-based Decoupling to Improve Model Generalization for Few-Shot Relation Extraction\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*Liang Zhang, Chulun Zhou, Fandong Meng, Jinsong Su, Yidong Chen, Jie Zhou*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a HyperNetwork-based Decoupling approach to improve the generalization of FSRE models and designs a two-step training strategy along with a class-agnostic aligner, by which the generated classifiers focus on acquiring relation-specific knowledge and the encoder is encouraged to learn more general relation knowledge.\n\n**Abstract:** Few-shot relation extraction (FSRE) aims to train a model that can deal with new relations using only a few labeled examples. Most existing studies employ Prototypical Networks for FSRE, which usually overfits the relation classes in the training set and cannot generalize well to unseen relations. By investigating the class separation of an FSRE model, we find that model upper layers are prone to learn relation-specific knowledge. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a HyperNetwork-based Decoupling approach to improve the generalization of FSRE models. Specifically, our model consists of an encoder, a network generator (for producing relation classifiers) and the generated-then-finetuned classifiers for every N -way- K -shot episode. Meanwhile, we design a two-step training strategy along with a class-agnostic aligner, by which the generated classifiers focus on acquiring relation-specific knowledge and the encoder is encouraged to learn more general relation knowledge. In this way, the roles of upper and lower layers in our FSRE model are explicitly decoupled, thus enhancing its generalizing capability during testing. Experiments on two public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

HyperPELT: Unified Parameter-Efficient Language Model Tuning for Both Language and Vision-and-Language Tasks\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*Zhengkun Zhang, Wenya Guo, Xiaojun Meng, Yasheng Wang, Yadao Wang, Xin Jiang, Qun Liu, Zhenglu Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper designs a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks and adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** The workflow of pretraining and fine-tuning has emerged as a popular paradigm for solving various NLP and V&L (Vision-and-Language) downstream tasks. With the capacity of pretrained models growing rapidly, how to perform parameter-efficient fine-tuning has become fairly important for quick transfer learning and deployment. In this paper, we design a novel unified parameter-efficient transfer learning framework that works effectively on both pure language and V&L tasks. In particular, we use a shared hypernetwork that takes trainable hyper-embeddings as input, and outputs weights for fine-tuning different small modules in a pretrained language model, such as tuning the parameters inserted into multi-head attention blocks (i.e., prefix-tuning) and feed-forward blocks (i.e., adapter-tuning). We define a set of embeddings (e.g., layer, block, task and visual embeddings) as the key components to calculate hyper-embeddings, which thus can support both pure language and V&L tasks. Our proposed framework adds fewer trainable parameters in multi-task learning while achieving superior performances and transfer ability compared to state-of-the-art methods. Empirical results on the GLUE benchmark and multiple V&L tasks confirm the effectiveness of our framework on both textual and visual modalities.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Hyper-X: A Unified Hypernetwork for Multi-Task Multilingual Transfer\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*A. Ustun, Arianna Bisazza, G. Bouma, Gertjan van Noord, Sebastian Ruder*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hyper-X is a single hypernetwork that unifies multi-task and multilingual learning with efficient adaptation and generates weights for adapter modules conditioned on both tasks and language embeddings, enabling zero-shot transfer for unseen languages and task-language combinations.\n\n**Abstract:** Massively multilingual models are promising for transfer learning across tasks and languages. However, existing methods are unable to fully leverage training data when it is available in different task-language combinations. To exploit such heterogeneous supervision, we propose Hyper-X, a single hypernetwork that unifies multi-task and multilingual learning with efficient adaptation. It generates weights for adapter modules conditioned on both tasks and language embeddings. By learning to combine task and language-specific knowledge, our model enables zero-shot transfer for unseen languages and task-language combinations. Our experiments on a diverse set of languages demonstrate that Hyper-X achieves the best or competitive gain when a mixture of multiple resources is available, while on par with strong baseline in the standard scenario. Hyper-X is also considerably more efficient in terms of parameters and resources compared to methods that train separate adapters. Finally, Hyper-X consistently produces strong results in few-shot scenarios for new languages, showing the versatility of our approach beyond zero-shot transfer.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 30  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 4. HINT: Hypernetwork Instruction Tuning for Efficient Zero- and Few-Shot Generalisation\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*Hamish Ivison, Akshita Bhagia, Yizhong Wang, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Matthew E. Peters*\n\n**TL;DR:** Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT) is introduced, which convert task instructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an underlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to include instructions in the model input.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent NLP models have shown the remarkable ability to effectively generalise \u2018zero-shot\u2019 to new tasks using only natural language instructions as guidance. However, many of these approaches suffer from high computational costs due to their reliance on concatenating lengthy instructions with every input example, resulting in costly reprocessing of the instruction. To avoid this, we introduce Hypernetworks for INstruction Tuning (HINT), which convert task instructions and examples into parameter-efficient modules inserted into an underlying model using a pretrained text encoder, eliminating the need to include instructions in the model input. The hypernetwork in HINT also produces an encoded instruction, which we concatenate with encoded inputs during decoding to further improve performance. HINT models outperform strong state-of-the-art baselines by over 10% when controlling for compute (measured in FLOPs). By converting instructions into modules, HINT models can effectively disregard the length of instructions and few-shot example inputs in terms of compute usage. As a result, HINT can enhance its performance by up to 25% by incorporating additional few-shot data, while utilizing only up to 5% more compute. This combines the strengths of parameter-efficient fine-tuning and in-context learning.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Towards Anytime Fine-tuning: Continually Pre-trained Language Models with Hypernetwork Prompt\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*Ying WEI, Defu Lian, Jun Zhou, James Y. Zhang, Siqiao Xue, Caigao Jiang, Gangwei Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual pre-training has been urgent for adapting a pre-trained model to a multitude of domains and tasks in the fast-evolving world. In practice, a continually pre-trained model is expected to demonstrate not only greater capacity when fine-tuned on pre-trained domains but also a non-decreasing performance on unseen ones. In this work, we first investigate such anytime fine-tuning effectiveness of existing continual pre-training approaches, concluding with unanimously decreased performance on unseen domains. To this end, we propose a prompt-guided continual pre-training method, where we train a hypernetwork to generate domain-specific prompts by both agreement and disagreement losses. The agreement loss maximally preserves the generalization of a pre-trained model to new domains, and the disagreement one guards the exclusiveness of the generated hidden states for each domain. Remarkably, prompts by the hypernetwork alleviate the domain identity when fine-tuning and promote knowledge transfer across domains. Our method achieved improvements of 3.57% and 3.4% on two real-world datasets (including domain shift and temporal shift), respectively, demonstrating its efficacy.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-19\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Dynamic Generation of Personalities with Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hypernetwork language model*\n\n*Zhaofeng He, Jie Fu, Huijia Wu, Liuyu Xiang, Tianyu Zheng, Hexiang Gu, Jianzhi Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** In the realm of mimicking human deliberation, large language models (LLMs) show promising performance, thereby amplifying the importance of this research area. Deliberation is influenced by both logic and personality. However, previous studies predominantly focused on the logic of LLMs, neglecting the exploration of personality aspects. In this work, we introduce Dynamic Personality Generation (DPG), a dynamic personality generation method based on Hypernetworks. Initially, we embed the Big Five personality theory into GPT-4 to form a personality assessment machine, enabling it to evaluate characters' personality traits from dialogues automatically. We propose a new metric to assess personality generation capability based on this evaluation method. Then, we use this personality assessment machine to evaluate dialogues in script data, resulting in a personality-dialogue dataset. Finally, we fine-tune DPG on the personality-dialogue dataset. Experiments prove that DPG's personality generation capability is stronger after fine-tuning on this dataset than traditional fine-tuning methods, surpassing prompt-based GPT-4.\n\n**Published:** 2024-04-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design by integrating HyperNetworks with parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods like LoRA, here are some key findings and references that align with your investigation plan:\n\n## Applications of HyperNetworks in Language Models\n\n- HyperNetworks have been explored for generating weights for primary networks, which can be particularly useful in language models. For instance, the concept of using HyperNetworks to generate method-specific and layer-specific parameters is discussed in the context of adversarial training, but it can be adapted for language models. This approach allows for dynamic parameter generation and can enhance model adaptability.\n\n## Dynamic Parameter Generation Techniques\n\n- The use of HyperNetworks for dynamic parameter generation is a promising area. In the context of adversarial training, HyperAT uses a shared HyperNetwork to generate weights for different LoRA modules based on method and layer embeddings. This technique can be extended to language models, enabling dynamic adaptation of model parameters without the need for extensive retraining.\n\n## Integration of HyperNetworks with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Methods\n\n- The integration of HyperNetworks with LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a key area of interest. LoRA involves low-rank decomposition of weight matrices, which can be generated dynamically using HyperNetworks. This approach can significantly reduce the number of trainable parameters while maintaining or improving model performance. The method described in HyperAT, where a shared HyperNetwork generates LoRA parameters for different layers and methods, can be directly applied to language models to enhance parameter efficiency and adaptability.\n\n### Specific References and Findings\n\n- **HyperAT and LoRA Integration**: The paper on HyperAT provides a detailed explanation of how HyperNetworks can be used to generate LoRA parameters dynamically. This method involves using a shared HyperNetwork to produce method-specific and layer-specific LoRA modules, which is highly relevant to improving the efficiency and adaptability of language models.\n\n- **Parameter Efficiency and Scalability**: The use of HyperNetworks to generate LoRA parameters ensures that the number of training parameters remains contained even as the model size and the number of tasks increase. This is crucial for maintaining efficiency and scalability in large language models.\n\n- **Dynamic Adaptation and Training Stability**: The dynamic parameter generation technique using HyperNetworks can impact training stability. However, by unifying method-specific LoRA across different layers and block types, and using layer ID and block position embeddings, the method ensures that the HyperNetwork can generate parameters that are consistent and stable across different layers and tasks.\n\n### Future Search Directions\n\n- **Existing Combinations**: Look for papers or research that have already combined HyperNetworks with LoRA or similar parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods in language models.

We propose to adapt pre-trained LMs into AutoCompressors. These models are capable of compressing long contexts into compact summary vectors, which are then accessible to the model as soft prompts. Summary vectors are trained with an unsupervised objective, whereby long documents are processed in segments and summary vectors from all previous segments are used in language modeling. We fine-tune OPT models on sequences of up to 30,720 tokens and show that AutoCompressors can utilize long contexts to improve perplexity. We evaluate AutoCompressors on in-context learning by compressing task demonstrations. We find that summary vectors are good substitutes for plain-text demonstrations, increasing accuracy while reducing inference cost. Finally, we explore the benefits of pre-computing summary vectors for large corpora by applying summary vectors to retrieval-augmented language modeling. Overall, AutoCompressors emerge as a simple and inexpensive solution for extending the context window of LMs while speeding up inference over long contexts.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/40 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nEdward J Hu, yelong shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan AllenZhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Lu Wang, and Weizhu Chen. 2022.

Score: 0.89)\n\n*Hengyu Zhang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention, but is still not as efficient as vanilla attention.\n\n**Abstract:** Extending the functionality of the Transformer model to accommodate longer sequence lengths has become a critical challenge. This extension is crucial not only for improving tasks such as language translation and long-context processing but also for enabling novel applications like chatbots, code generation, and multimedia content creation. The primary obstacle is the self-attention mechanism, which scales quadratically with sequence length in terms of computation time and memory requirements. LongLoRA proposed shifted sparse attention (S\\(^2\\)-Attn), effectively enabling context extension and leading to non-trivial computation savings with similar performance to fine-tuning with vanilla attention. However, LongLoRA is still not as efficient as vanilla attention, reaching only 39\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention. This inefficiency is due to the cyclic shift applied within different attention head patterns, causing either chaos in the attention head structure or unnecessary information exchange between token groups. To address these issues, We propose \\textbf{SinkLoRA}, which features better work partitioning. Specifically, (1) we developed SF-Attn with a segmentation and reassembly algorithm to proportionally return cyclically shifted groups of attention heads to their un-shifted state together with global attention of\"sink attention tokens\", achieving 92\\% of the perplexity improvement compared to full attention after fine tuning, and (2) applied a SOTA KV cache compression algorithm H$_2$O to accelerate inference. Furthermore, We conducted supervised fine-tuning with SinkLoRA using a self collected LongAlpaca-plus dataset. All our code, models, datasets, and demos are available at \\url{https://github.com/Dexter-GT-86/SinkLoRA}.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/28 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIt aims to facilitate more information exchange between different groups of tokens. However, this approach also leads to an information leaking problem. The information leaking issue likely arises because the shift operation allows tokens from different segments to share information too freely. While the intention is to enhance the model's ability to integrate information from various parts of the sequence, it inadvertently causes tokens to access information that they should not be aware of at that particular stage of processing. This premature exposure to information can disrupt the model's learning process, leading to overfitting or incorrect associations. Moreover, the shift operation might blur the distinct boundaries between token groups, causing the model to lose track of the specific context within each group. This can result in a degradation of performance, as the model might struggle to maintain a coherent understanding of the local context, which is essential for accurately interpreting and generating long sequences. In summary, while the shift operation aims to improve information exchange, it inadvertently causes information leakage by allowing tokens to prematurely access and integrate information from different segments. This undermines the model's ability to maintain distinct contextual boundaries and can negatively impact its performance on tasks requiring precise contextual understanding. ### 5.2 The Success of Making Sink Attention Tokens Globally Operative\n\nThe method described in the following section details the successful implementation of globally operative sink attention tokens, enhancing the model's ability to handle long sequences efficiently. The successful results observed from implementing sink attention tokens can be attributed to several key factors. First, by designating specific tokens as sink attention tokens that attend to all other tokens in the sequence, the model can effectively capture and integrate information from across the entire sequence. This global attention mechanism ensures that critical information is not lost, even in very long sequences. Furthermore, by ensuring that all tokens in the sequence also attend to the sink attention tokens, the model can maintain a coherent understanding of the sequence context. This bidirectional attention flow allows the model to reinforce important information at multiple stages, enhancing the overall comprehension and retention of context. The efficient complexity of $O(n \\log n)$ achieved through this method, due to the relatively small number of sink attention tokens, ensures that this enhanced capability does not come at the cost of significantly increased computational overhead. This balance between maintaining comprehensive attention and computational efficiency is likely a key factor in the improved performance observed in models utilizing this technique. In summary, the implementation of globally operative sink attention tokens allows the model to maintain a robust and coherent understanding of long sequences, ensuring critical information is\nattended to throughout the processing stages, thus leading to improved performance on tasks requiring extensive context comprehension. ### 5.3 The Convenience of Applying KV Cache Compression Function\n\nAs the results shown in the $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ inference test indicate, the $\\mathrm{H}_{2} \\mathrm{O}$ method can maintain accuracy even when the KV cache budget is reduced by half. However, the time savings achieved with this method are significant, reducing inference time by a factor of 1.5 . This capability allows for flexible deployment of inference methods based on the available computing resources. The ability to adjust the KV cache budget without compromising accuracy ensures that large language models can be efficiently and effectively utilized in resource-constrained environments, optimizing both performance and computational efficiency. ### 5.4 The Good Result of Chatbot\n\nAs shown in the example of chat ability comparison in Section C, we observe the responses from two versions of the LongLoRA model to a story-related question. The user input describes a narrative involving an old fisherman named Tom, who ventures farther out to sea to a place known as the \"Blue Deep\" in hopes of finding fish after several unsuccessful weeks. The question asks why Tom decided to venture farther out to sea than he ever had before. The LongLoRA-7B model's response focuses on Tom's desperation and worry about not catching any fish, emphasizing his repeated return with an empty net and his determination to support his family. This response accurately captures the key elements of Tom's motivation as described in the narrative. On the other hand, the SinkLoRA-7B model provides a more detailed explanation, highlighting the prolonged disappearance of fish and Tom's resultant decision to take the risk of venturing to the \"Blue Deep.' It also mentions Tom's hope to find fish there, providing a more comprehensive understanding of his motivations. The reason for the differing levels of detail and context in the responses can be attributed to the training and fine-tuning differences between the two models. The SinkLoRA-7B model might have been trained on a more diverse dataset or undergone additional fine-tuning to better understand and generate contextually rich responses. This additional training could enable it to provide more nuanced and detailed answers, capturing the subtleties of the narrative more effectively. In conclusion, both models successfully identify Tom's primary motivation, but the SinkLoRA-7B model offers a more thorough and contextually rich explanation. This comparison underscores the effectiveness of the chat capabilities in understanding and accurately responding to narrative-based questions. The observed differences highlight the importance of extensive training and fine-tuning in enhancing model performance and response quality. ## 6 Conclusion and Future Work\n\nIn this study, we introduced SinkLoRA, a significant enhancement over the original LongLoRA, designed to improve the efficiency and performance of large language models (LLMs) in handling long-context sequences. SinkLoRA addresses the limitations of the previous model by implementing Sink Fixed Attention (SF-Attn) and utilizing advanced KV cache compression techniques like the Heavy-Hitter Oracle (H2O). Our proposed SF-Attn method effectively redistributes attention scores, reducing the overemphasis on initial tokens and improving overall model accuracy. This approach, combined with the segmentation and reassembly algorithm, allows for better handling of extended contexts without increasing computational complexity. The integration of the H2O KV cache compression further accelerates inference, making SinkLoRA a highly efficient solution for deploying LLMs in resource-constrained environments. Future work will focus on further optimizing the attention mechanisms and exploring the compatibility of SinkLoRA with other types of LLMs and position encodings. We also plan to investigate more advanced KV cache management techniques to enhance the flexibility and efficiency of inference processes. The goal is to continue improving the performance and scalability of LLMs, enabling their application in a broader range of tasks and environments. In summary, SinkLoRA represents a\nsubstantial step forward in the development of efficient long-context processing techniques for large language models, offering promising avenues for future research and application. ## References\n\n[1] Pascal Severin Andermatt and Tobias Fankhauser.

Recent approaches show that scaling the model achieves human-level performance. However, with increasing demands for scaling and constraints on hardware memory, the inference costs of these models remain high. To reduce the inference time, Multi-Query Attention (MQA) and Grouped-Query Attention (GQA) were proposed in (Shazeer, 2019) and (Ainslieet al., 2023) respectively. In this paper, we propose a variation of Grouped-Query Attention, termed Weighted Grouped-Query Attention (WGQA). We introduced new learnable parameters for each key and value head in the T5 decoder attention blocks, enabling the model to take a weighted average during finetuning. Our model achieves an average of 0.53% improvement over GQA, and the performance converges to traditional Multi-head attention (MHA) with no additional overhead during inference. We evaluated the introduction of these parameters and subsequent finetuning informs the model about the grouping mechanism during training, thereby enhancing performance. Additionally, we demonstrate the scaling laws in our analysis by comparing the results between T5-small and T5-base architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/10 (Score: 0.70)*\n\n```\nMarkus Freitag and Yaser Al-Onaizan. 2017.

We propose a novel neural architecture Transformer-XL that enables learning dependency beyond a fixed length without disrupting temporal coherence. It consists of a segment-level recurrence mechanism and a novel positional encoding scheme. Our method not only enables capturing longer-term dependency, but also resolves the context fragmentation problem. As a result, Transformer-XL learns dependency that is 80% longer than RNNs and 450% longer than vanilla Transformers, achieves better performance on both short and long sequences, and is up to 1,800+ times faster than vanilla Transformers during evaluation. Notably, we improve the state-of-the-art results of bpc/perplexity to 0.99 on enwiki8, 1.08 on text8, 18.3 on WikiText-103, 21.8 on One Billion Word, and 54.5 on Penn Treebank (without finetuning). When trained only on WikiText-103, Transformer-XL manages to generate reasonably coherent, novel text articles with thousands of tokens. Our code, pretrained models, and hyperparameters are available in both Tensorflow and PyTorch.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.22)*\n\n```\nOfir Press and Lior Wolf. 2016.

LoRA: Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*J. E. Hu, Yelong Shen, Phillip Wallis, Zeyuan Allen-Zhu, Yuanzhi Li, Shean Wang, Weizhu Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, is proposed, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** An important paradigm of natural language processing consists of large-scale pre-training on general domain data and adaptation to particular tasks or domains. As we pre-train larger models, full fine-tuning, which retrains all model parameters, becomes less feasible. Using GPT-3 175B as an example -- deploying independent instances of fine-tuned models, each with 175B parameters, is prohibitively expensive. We propose Low-Rank Adaptation, or LoRA, which freezes the pre-trained model weights and injects trainable rank decomposition matrices into each layer of the Transformer architecture, greatly reducing the number of trainable parameters for downstream tasks. Compared to GPT-3 175B fine-tuned with Adam, LoRA can reduce the number of trainable parameters by 10,000 times and the GPU memory requirement by 3 times. LoRA performs on-par or better than fine-tuning in model quality on RoBERTa, DeBERTa, GPT-2, and GPT-3, despite having fewer trainable parameters, a higher training throughput, and, unlike adapters, no additional inference latency. We also provide an empirical investigation into rank-deficiency in language model adaptation, which sheds light on the efficacy of LoRA. We release a package that facilitates the integration of LoRA with PyTorch models and provide our implementations and model checkpoints for RoBERTa, DeBERTa, and GPT-2 at https://github.com/microsoft/LoRA.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 6350  (*Influential: 1121*)\n\n#### 2.

In this work we focus on the scenario where quantization and LoRA fine-tuning are applied together on a pre-trained model. In such cases it is common to observe a consistent gap in the performance on downstream tasks between full fine-tuning and quantization plus LoRA fine-tuning approach. In response, we propose LoftQ (LoRA-Fine-Tuning-aware Quantization), a novel quantization framework that simultaneously quantizes an LLM and finds a proper low-rank initialization for LoRA fine-tuning. Such an initialization alleviates the discrepancy between the quantized and full-precision model and significantly improves generalization in downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on natural language understanding, question answering, summarization, and natural language generation tasks. Experiments show that our method is highly effective and outperforms existing quantization methods, especially in the challenging 2-bit and 2/4-bit mixed precision regimes.

QA-LoRA: Quantization-Aware Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Yuhui Xu, Lingxi Xie, Xiaotao Gu, Xin Chen, Heng Chang, Hengheng Zhang, Zhensu Chen, Xiaopeng Zhang, Qi Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** A quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm that equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; and after fine- Tuning,the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced degrees of freedom of quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators which increase the degree of freedom of quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM's weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

Specializing Smaller Language Models towards Multi-Step Reasoning\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Yao Fu, Hao-Chun Peng, Litu Ou, Ashish Sabharwal, Tushar Khot*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work shows two important aspects of model abilities: there exists a very complex balance/ tradeoff between language models' multi-dimensional abilities, and by paying the price of decreased generic ability, it can clearly lift up the scaling curve of models smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability.\n\n**Abstract:** The surprising ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to perform well on complex reasoning with only few-shot chain-of-thought prompts is believed to emerge only in very large-scale models (100+ billion parameters). We show that such abilities can, in fact, be distilled down from GPT-3.5 ($\\ge$ 175B) to T5 variants ($\\le$ 11B). We propose model specialization, to specialize the model's ability towards a target task. The hypothesis is that large models (commonly viewed as larger than 100B) have strong modeling power, but are spread on a large spectrum of tasks. Small models (commonly viewed as smaller than 10B) have limited model capacity, but if we concentrate their capacity on a specific target task, the model can achieve a decent improved performance. We use multi-step math reasoning as our testbed because it is a very typical emergent ability. We show two important aspects of model abilities: (1). there exists a very complex balance/ tradeoff between language models' multi-dimensional abilities; (2). by paying the price of decreased generic ability, we can clearly lift up the scaling curve of models smaller than 10B towards a specialized multi-step math reasoning ability. We further give comprehensive discussions about important design choices for better generalization, including the tuning data format, the start model checkpoint, and a new model selection method. We hope our practice and discoveries can serve as an important attempt towards specialized smaller models in the new research paradigm set by LLMs.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 185  (*Influential: 28*)\n\n#### 5. Grounding Large Language Models in Interactive Environments with Online Reinforcement Learning\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Thomas Carta, Cl\u00e9ment Romac, Thomas Wolf, S. Lamprier, Olivier Sigaud, Pierre-Yves Oudeyer*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper considers an agent using an LLM as a policy that is progressively updated as the agent interacts with the environment, leveraging online Reinforcement Learning to improve its performance to solve goals.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works successfully leveraged Large Language Models' (LLM) abilities to capture abstract knowledge about world's physics to solve decision-making problems. Yet, the alignment between LLMs' knowledge and the environment can be wrong and limit functional competence due to lack of grounding. In this paper, we study an approach (named GLAM) to achieve this alignment through functional grounding: we consider an agent using an LLM as a policy that is progressively updated as the agent interacts with the environment, leveraging online Reinforcement Learning to improve its performance to solve goals. Using an interactive textual environment designed to study higher-level forms of functional grounding, and a set of spatial and navigation tasks, we study several scientific questions: 1) Can LLMs boost sample efficiency for online learning of various RL tasks? 2) How can it boost different forms of generalization? 3) What is the impact of online learning? We study these questions by functionally grounding several variants (size, architecture) of FLAN-T5.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 128  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Camoscio: an Italian Instruction-tuned LLaMA\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Emanuele Rodol\u00e0, Andrea Santilli*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years Large Language Models (LLMs) have increased the state of the art on several natural language processing tasks. However, their accessibility is often limited to paid API services, posing challenges for researchers in conducting extensive investigations. On the other hand, while some open-source models have been proposed by the community, they are typically English-centric or multilingual without a specific adaptation for the Italian language. In an effort to democratize the available and open resources for the Italian language, in this paper we introduce Camoscio: a language model specifically tuned to follow users' prompts in Italian. Specifically, we finetuned the smallest variant of LLaMA (7b) with LoRA on a corpus of instruction prompts translated to Italian via ChatGPT. Results indicate that the model's zero-shot performance on various downstream tasks in Italian competes favorably with existing models specifically finetuned for those tasks.

VB-LoRA: Extreme Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning with Vector Banks\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Shihao Ji, Shaobo Han, Yang Li*\n\n**Abstract:** As the adoption of large language models increases and the need for per-user or per-task model customization grows, the parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA) and its variants, incur substantial storage and transmission costs. To further reduce stored parameters, we introduce a \"divide-and-share\" paradigm that breaks the barriers of low-rank decomposition across matrix dimensions, modules, and layers by sharing parameters globally via a vector bank. As an instantiation of the paradigm to LoRA, our proposed VB-LoRA composites all the low-rank matrices of LoRA from a shared vector bank with a differentiable top-k admixture module. VB-LoRA achieves extreme parameter efficiency while maintaining comparable or better performance compared to state-of-the-art PEFT methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of VB-LoRA on natural language understanding, natural language generation, instruction tuning, and mathematical reasoning tasks. When fine-tuning the Llama2-13B model, VB-LoRA only uses 0.4% of LoRA's stored parameters, yet achieves superior results. Our source code is available at https://github.com/leo-yangli/VB-LoRA. This method has been merged into the Hugging Face PEFT package.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 3. Tracking Meets LoRA: Faster Training, Larger Model, Stronger Performance\n\n*From Search Query: LoRA variants language models*\n\n*Haibin Ling, Yong Xu, YaoWei Wang, Zhipeng Zhang, Heng Fan, Liting Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Motivated by the Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in large language models, we propose LoRAT, a method that unveils the power of large ViT model for tracking within laboratory-level resources. The essence of our work lies in adapting LoRA, a technique that fine-tunes a small subset of model parameters without adding inference latency, to the domain of visual tracking. However, unique challenges and potential domain gaps make this transfer not as easy as the first intuition. Firstly, a transformer-based tracker constructs unshared position embedding for template and search image. This poses a challenge for the transfer of LoRA, usually requiring consistency in the design when applied to the pre-trained backbone, to downstream tasks. Secondly, the inductive bias inherent in convolutional heads diminishes the effectiveness of parameter-efficient fine-tuning in tracking models. To overcome these limitations, we first decouple the position embeddings in transformer-based trackers into shared spatial ones and independent type ones. The shared embeddings, which describe the absolute coordinates of multi-resolution images (namely, the template and search images), are inherited from the pre-trained backbones. In contrast, the independent embeddings indicate the sources of each token and are learned from scratch. Furthermore, we design an anchor-free head solely based on MLP to adapt PETR, enabling better performance with less computational overhead. With our design, 1) it becomes practical to train trackers with the ViT-g backbone on GPUs with only memory of 25.8GB (batch size of 16); 2) we reduce the training time of the L-224 variant from 35.0 to 10.8 GPU hours; 3) we improve the LaSOT SUC score from 0.703 to 0.742 with the L-224 variant; 4) we fast the inference speed of the L-224 variant from 52 to 119 FPS. Code and models are available at https://github.com/LitingLin/LoRAT.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-08\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models using LoRA variants and other parameter-efficient methods, here are some key findings and techniques from the recent developments:\n\n## Recent Developments and Variants of LoRA\n\n1. **Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO**:\n   This approach introduces a method to combine multiple LoRA modules efficiently using \"Rank-Wise Clustering.\" This technique allows for the identification and merging of compatible LoRA modules, creating more compact and expressive models without sacrificing performance. This is particularly useful for deploying large language models on resource-constrained devices.\n\n2. **MiLoRA: Efficient Mixture of Low-Rank Adaptation**:\n   MiLoRA integrates LoRA with a mixture-of-experts (MOE) framework, where each LoRA module is treated as an expert. It employs a prompt-aware routing mechanism to reduce latency in multi-tenant settings. This method outperforms other PEFT baselines and significantly reduces latency, making it suitable for efficient fine-tuning in various tasks.\n\n## Techniques for Improving LoRA Efficiency and Effectiveness\n\n1. **Efficient Merging and Clustering**:\n   The \"Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO\" approach enhances efficiency by clustering and merging LoRA modules based on their singular value distributions. This method ensures that the merged modules are compatible and can be fine-tuned effectively, reducing the overall model size and improving performance.\n\n2. **Prompt-Aware Routing Mechanism**:\n   MiLoRA's prompt-aware routing mechanism calculates expert routing results once before generating the first new token and reuses these results for subsequent tokens. This reduces the computational overhead and latency associated with traditional LoRA and MOE methods.\n\n3. **Optimizing LoRA Parameters**:\n   LoRA's core concept involves updating the weight matrix using low-rank matrices, which significantly reduces the number of parameters to be trained. This optimization is crucial for efficient fine-tuning, especially in resource-constrained environments.\n\n## Integration of LoRA with Other Parameter-Efficient Methods\n\n1. **Combining LoRA with Model Compression**:\n   The \"Merging LoRAs like Playing LEGO\" paper also discusses the integration of LoRA with model compression techniques. It introduces a Compression-Aware LoRA (CA-LoRA) framework that adapts existing LoRAs to compressed model versions, ensuring that the model's performance is not compromised despite the reduced size.\n\n2. **Mixture-of-Experts (MOE) Integration**:\n   MiLoRA integrates LoRA with MOE, treating each LoRA module as an expert. This integration allows for efficient routing and reduces latency, making it a robust method for multi-task and multi-tenant settings.\n\n3. **Potential Integration with HyperNetworks**:\n   While not explicitly covered in the provided sources, the analysis suggests potential benefits from integrating LoRA with hypernetworks, similar to the approaches in HyperPELT, Hyper-X, and HINT. These methods use shared hypernetworks to generate weights for different modules, which could be combined with LoRA to enhance adaptability and efficiency in autoregressive language models.\n\nBy leveraging these techniques, researchers can develop more efficient, effective, and scalable autoregressive language models that combine the strengths of LoRA and other parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods.\n",

The mainstream approach to addressing extrapolation with LLMs involves modifying RoPE by replacing 10000, the rotary base of $\\theta_n={10000}^{-2n/d}$ in the original RoPE, with a larger value and providing longer fine-tuning text. In this work, we first observe that fine-tuning a RoPE-based LLM with either a smaller or larger base in pre-training context length could significantly enhance its extrapolation performance. After that, we propose \\textbf{\\textit{Scaling Laws of RoPE-based Extrapolation}}, a unified framework from the periodic perspective, to describe the relationship between the extrapolation performance and base value as well as tuning context length. In this process, we also explain the origin of the RoPE-based extrapolation issue by \\textbf{\\textit{critical dimension for extrapolation}}. Besides these observations and analyses, we achieve extrapolation up to 1 million context length within only 16K training length on LLaMA2 7B and 13B.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.48)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 54th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2016, August 7-12, 2016, Berlin, Germany, Volume 1: Long Papers.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 3.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.34)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, existing SP methods do not take advantage of linear attention features, resulting in sub-optimal parallelism efficiency and usability for linear attention-based language models. In this paper, we introduce Linear Attention Sequence Parallel (LASP), an efficient SP method tailored to linear attention-based language models. Specifically, we design an efficient point-to-point communication mechanism to leverage the right-product kernel trick of linear attention, which sharply decreases the communication overhead of SP. We also enhance the practical efficiency of LASP by performing kernel fusion and intermediate state caching, making the implementation of LASP hardware-friendly on GPU clusters. Furthermore, we meticulously ensure the compatibility of sequence-level LASP with all types of batch-level data parallel methods, which is vital for distributed training on large clusters with long sequences and large batches. We conduct extensive experiments on two linear attention-based models with varying sequence lengths and GPU cluster sizes. LASP scales sequence length up to 4096K using 128 A100 80G GPUs on 1B models, which is 8 times longer than existing SP methods while being significantly faster.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 7 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory efficient hypernetworks language models\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Client-Customized Adaptation for Parameter-Efficient Federated Learning\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Yeachan Kim, Junho Kim, Wing-Lam Mok, Jun-Hyung Park, SangKeun Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes C2A, a novel hypernetwork-based FL framework that generates client-specific adapters by conditioning the client information that can maximize the utility of shared model parameters while minimizing the divergence caused by client heterogeneity.\n\n**Abstract:** Despite the versatility of pre-trained language models (PLMs) across domains, their large memory footprints pose significant challenges in federated learning (FL), where the training model has to be distributed between a server and clients. One potential solution to bypass such constraints might be the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) in the context of FL. However, we have observed that typical PEFT tends to severely suffer from heterogeneity among clients in FL scenarios, resulting in unstable and slow convergence. In this paper, we propose C lient-C ustomized A daptation (C2A), a novel hypernetwork-based FL framework that generates client-specific adapters by conditioning the client information. With the effectiveness of the hypernetworks in generating customized weights through learning to adopt the different characteristics of inputs, C2A can maximize the utility of shared model parameters while minimizing the divergence caused by client heterogeneity. To verify the efficacy of C2A, we perform extensive evaluations on FL scenarios involving heterogeneity in label and language distributions. Comprehensive evaluation results clearly support the superiority of C2A in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness in FL scenarios 1 .\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 12  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Memory-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Compressed Large Language Models via sub-4-bit Integer Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Jeonghoon Kim, J. H. Lee, Sungdong Kim, Joonsuk Park, Kang Min Yoo, S. Kwon, Dongsoo Lee*\n\n**TL;DR:** Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) is presented - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs and significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) face the challenges in fine-tuning and deployment due to their high memory demands and computational costs. While parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods aim to reduce the memory usage of the optimizer state during fine-tuning, the inherent size of pre-trained LLM weights continues to be a pressing concern. Even though quantization techniques are widely proposed to ease memory demands and accelerate LLM inference, most of these techniques are geared towards the deployment phase. To bridge this gap, this paper presents Parameter-Efficient and Quantization-aware Adaptation (PEQA) - a simple yet effective method that combines the advantages of PEFT with quantized LLMs. By updating solely the quantization scales, PEQA can be directly applied to quantized LLMs, ensuring seamless task transitions. Parallel to existing PEFT methods, PEQA significantly reduces the memory overhead associated with the optimizer state. Furthermore, it leverages the advantages of quantization to substantially reduce model sizes. Even after fine-tuning, the quantization structure of a PEQA-tuned LLM remains intact, allowing for accelerated inference on the deployment stage. We employ PEQA-tuning for task-specific adaptation on LLMs with up to 65 billion parameters. To assess the logical reasoning and language comprehension of PEQA-tuned LLMs, we fine-tune low-bit quantized LLMs using a instruction dataset. Our results show that even when LLMs are quantized to below 4-bit precision, their capabilities in language modeling, few-shot in-context learning, and comprehension can be resiliently restored to (or even improved over) their full-precision original performances with PEQA.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 66  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Quantized Side Tuning: Fast and Memory-Efficient Tuning of Quantized Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Zhengxin Zhang, Dan Zhao, Xupeng Miao, Gabriele Oliaro, Qing Li, Yong Jiang, Zhihao Jia*\n\n**TL;DR:** Quantized Side Tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process, and leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states.\n\n**Abstract:** Finetuning large language models (LLMs) has been empirically effective on a variety of downstream tasks. Existing approaches to finetuning an LLM either focus on parameter-efficient finetuning, which only updates a small number of trainable parameters, or attempt to reduce the memory footprint during the training phase of the finetuning. Typically, the memory footprint during finetuning stems from three contributors: model weights, optimizer states, and intermediate activations. However, existing works still require considerable memory and none can simultaneously mitigate memory footprint for all three sources. In this paper, we present Quantized Side Tuing (QST), which enables memory-efficient and fast finetuning of LLMs by operating through a dual-stage process. First, QST quantizes an LLM's model weights into 4-bit to reduce the memory footprint of the LLM's original weights; QST also introduces a side network separated from the LLM, which utilizes the hidden states of the LLM to make task-specific predictions. Using a separate side network avoids performing backpropagation through the LLM, thus reducing the memory requirement of the intermediate activations. Furthermore, QST leverages several low-rank adaptors and gradient-free downsample modules to significantly reduce the trainable parameters, so as to save the memory footprint of the optimizer states. Experiments show that QST can reduce the total memory footprint by up to 2.3 $\\times$ and speed up the finetuning process by up to 3 $\\times$ while achieving competent performance compared with the state-of-the-art. When it comes to full finetuning, QST can reduce the total memory footprint up to 7 $\\times$.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

LoGAH: Predicting 774-Million-Parameter Transformers using Graph HyperNetworks with 1/100 Parameters\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Jie Fu, Alexia Jolicoeur-Martineau, Boris Knyazev, Xinyu Zhou*\n\n**Abstract:** A good initialization of deep learning models is essential since it can help them converge better and faster. However, pretraining large models is unaffordable for many researchers, which makes a desired prediction for initial parameters more necessary nowadays. Graph HyperNetworks (GHNs), one approach to predicting model parameters, have recently shown strong performance in initializing large vision models. Unfortunately, predicting parameters of very wide networks relies on copying small chunks of parameters multiple times and requires an extremely large number of parameters to support full prediction, which greatly hinders its adoption in practice. To address this limitation, we propose LoGAH (Low-rank GrAph Hypernetworks), a GHN with a low-rank parameter decoder that expands to significantly wider networks without requiring as excessive increase of parameters as in previous attempts. LoGAH allows us to predict the parameters of 774-million large neural networks in a memory-efficient manner. We show that vision and language models (i.e., ViT and GPT-2) initialized with LoGAH achieve better performance than those initialized randomly or using existing hypernetworks. Furthermore, we show promising transfer learning results w.r.t. training LoGAH on small datasets and using the predicted parameters to initialize for larger tasks.

Towards Efficient Pareto Set Approximation via Mixture of Experts Based Model Fusion\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient hypernetworks language models*\n\n*Bo Du, Han Hu, Shiwei Liu, Yong Luo, Li Shen, Anke Tang*\n\n**Abstract:** Solving multi-objective optimization problems for large deep neural networks is a challenging task due to the complexity of the loss landscape and the expensive computational cost of training and evaluating models. Efficient Pareto front approximation of large models enables multi-objective optimization for various tasks such as multi-task learning and trade-off analysis. Existing algorithms for learning Pareto set, including (1) evolutionary, hypernetworks, and hypervolume-maximization methods, are computationally expensive and have restricted scalability to large models; (2) Scalarization algorithms, where a separate model is trained for each objective ray, which is inefficient for learning the entire Pareto set and fails to capture the objective trade-offs effectively. Inspired by the recent success of model merging, we propose a practical and scalable approach to Pareto set learning problem via mixture of experts (MoE) based model fusion. By ensembling the weights of specialized single-task models, the MoE module can effectively capture the trade-offs between multiple objectives and closely approximate the entire Pareto set of large neural networks. Once the routers are learned and a preference vector is set, the MoE module can be unloaded, thus no additional computational cost is introduced during inference. We conduct extensive experiments on vision and language tasks using large-scale models such as CLIP-ViT and GPT-2. The experimental results demonstrate that our method efficiently approximates the entire Pareto front of large models. Using only hundreds of trainable parameters of the MoE routers, our method even has lower memory usage compared to linear scalarization and algorithms that learn a single Pareto optimal solution, and are scalable to both the number of objectives and the size of the model.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-14\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models with a focus on memory-efficient implementations of HyperNetworks, reducing memory overhead in dynamic parameter generation, and balancing adaptability and memory efficiency, here are some key findings and suggestions based on the provided sources and additional insights:\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of HyperNetworks\n\n1. **Neural Metamorphosis (NeuMeta)**:\n   This approach introduces self-morphable architectures that dynamically adapt their structure without retraining. By leveraging Implicit Neural Representations (INR) as hypernetworks, NeuMeta enables dynamic transformations while ensuring smooth performance across configurations. This method can be particularly useful for creating memory-efficient HyperNetworks that adapt to different tasks and hardware demands.\n\n## Techniques for Reducing Memory Overhead in Dynamic Parameter Generation\n\n1. **Targeted Vaccine (T-Vaccine)**:\n   While primarily focused on safety alignment, T-Vaccine demonstrates a method of applying perturbations only to safety-critical layers, keeping other layers frozen. This selective approach can be adapted to reduce memory overhead in dynamic parameter generation by identifying and updating only the necessary parameters.\n\n2. **LoRA and Variants**:\n   Methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation of Large Language Models) and its variants (e.g., LoftQ, QA-LoRA, SinkLoRA) are designed to be memory-efficient by inserting lightweight neural network modules into large models. These methods optimize only the parameters of these adapters during fine-tuning, reducing overall memory consumption[References in the analysis].\n\n## Methods for Balancing Adaptability and Memory Efficiency\n\n1. **Balancing Quantization and Adaptation**:\n   QA-LoRA introduces group-wise operators that increase the degree of freedom of quantization while decreasing that of adaptation. This balance is crucial for managing computational efficiency and memory usage. Similar strategies can be applied to HyperNetworks to ensure they are both adaptable and memory-efficient[References in the analysis].\n\n2. **Efficient Attention Mechanisms**:\n   SinkLoRA features better work partitioning and uses a segmentation and reassembly algorithm with SF-Attn, which is an efficient attention mechanism. Integrating such mechanisms into HyperNetworks can help manage memory efficiently while maintaining adaptability[References in the analysis].\n\n3. **Dynamic Architecture Adaptation**:\n   The NeuMeta approach allows neural networks to flexibly resize and adjust based on hardware or task demands. This dynamic adaptation can be integrated with HyperNetworks to ensure that the model remains both adaptable and memory-efficient across different scenarios.\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n- **Initialization and Adaptation Strategies**:\n  Proper initialization and adaptation strategies are crucial for the effective integration of HyperNetworks with parameter-efficient methods. This includes ensuring that the initialization of the HyperNetworks aligns well with the dynamic adaptation needs of the model[References in the analysis].\n\n- **Training Stability Techniques**:\n  Techniques like those used in T-Vaccine, which selectively perturb safety-critical layers, can be adapted to ensure training stability in dynamic parameter generation. This helps in balancing the adaptability of the model with the need for stable training.\n\nBy combining these insights, researchers can develop autoregressive language models that are not only highly adaptable but also memory-efficient, leveraging the strengths of HyperNetworks, LoRA variants, and dynamic architecture adaptation.\n",

**Original Computation**: \\(\\mathcal{O}(d^2)\\)\n   - **Adaptation Overhead**: \\(\\mathcal{O}(d r)\\), which is negligible for small \\(r\\).\n\n## Implementation Guidelines\n\n### Pseudo-Code for the Enhanced MetaLearner\n\n```python\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\n\nclass HyperLoRAMetaLearner(GAUBase):\n    def __init__(self, embed_dim: int, block_loc: tuple, kwarg_all: dict,\n                 device=None, dtype=None, rank: int = 4, **kwargs):\n        self.factory_kwargs = {'device': device, 'dtype': dtype}\n        super().__init__(embed_dim, block_loc, kwarg_all)\n        self.rank = rank\n\n        # HyperNetworks to generate A(X) and B(X)\n        self.hypernet_A = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim * self.rank, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n\n        self.hypernet_B = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs),\n            nn.ReLU(),\n            nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim * self.rank, **self.factory_kwargs)\n        )\n\n        # Original weight matrix W (e.g., for a projection layer)\n        self.W = nn.Linear(embed_dim, embed_dim, **self.factory_kwargs)\n\n    def _forward(self, X, **Z):\n        \"\"\"\n        Forward pass of the HyperLoRAMetaLearner.\n\n        Args:\n            X (Tensor): Input tensor of shape (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim)\n            Z (dict): Dictionary of intermediate variables\n\n        Returns:\n            Tuple[Tensor, dict]: Output tensor and updated Z\n        \"\"\"\n        batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim = X.size()\n\n        # Generate low-rank adaptation matrices A(X) and B(X)\n        A = self.hypernet_A(X)  # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim * rank)\n        B = self.hypernet_B(X)  # Shape: (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim * rank)\n\n        # Reshape A and B to (batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, rank)\n        A = A.view(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, self.rank)\n        B = B.view(batch_size, seq_len, embed_dim, self.rank)\n\n        # Compute adaptation term for each position\n        delta_WX = torch.einsum('bsdr,bsr->bsd', A, B.transpose(-2, -1).matmul(X.unsqueeze(-1)).squeeze(-1))\n\n        # Original projection\n        WX = self.W(X)\n\n        # Combine original and adaptation\n        Y = WX + delta_WX\n\n        return Y, Z\n```\n\n### Step-by-Step Integration\n\n1. **Initialize HyperLoRAMetaLearner**\n\n   - Replace the existing MetaLearner with HyperLoRAMetaLearner in the model initialization.\n\n2. **Update Forward Pass**\n\n   - In the forward pass, the HyperLoRAMetaLearner computes the dynamic low-rank adaptation and applies it to the selected layers.\n\n3. **Select Layers for Adaptation**\n\n   - Identify layers where the weight updates will be applied (e.g., attention projections).\n\n4. **Training**\n\n   - Use standard training procedures.\n   - Monitor training stability and adjust hyperparameters as needed.\n\n### Computational Considerations\n\n- **Memory Efficiency**\n\n  - Low-rank matrices reduce memory usage.\n  - Dynamic generation avoids storing large adaptation matrices.\n\n- **Computational Overhead**\n\n  - Minimal overhead due to small rank \\(r\\).\n  - Parallel computation can be utilized for efficiency.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIntegrating HyperNetworks with Low-Rank Adaptation into the MetaLearner GAU results in a dynamic, efficient, and scalable model. This design allows for real-time parameter adaptation based on input data while maintaining computational efficiency through low-rank approximations. The proposed HyperLoRAMetaLearner enhances the model's adaptability to diverse inputs and tasks, potentially improving perplexity and downstream performance without significant increases in computational costs.\n\n## References\n\n1. **Ha, D., Dai, A., & Le, Q.
