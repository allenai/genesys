FlashAttention: Fast and Memory-Efficient Exact Attention with IO-Awareness (Avg. Score: 1.00)\n\n*Tri Dao, Daniel Y. Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba.

Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.92)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.92)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 5. Coupled Mamba: Enhanced Multi-modal Fusion with Coupled State Space Model (Avg. Score: 0.85)\n\n*Wenbing Li, Hang Zhou, Junqing Yu, Zikai Song, Wei Yang*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** The Coupled SSM model is proposed, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes, and demonstrates that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n**Abstract:** The essence of multi-modal fusion lies in exploiting the complementary information inherent in diverse modalities. However, prevalent fusion methods rely on traditional neural architectures and are inadequately equipped to capture the dynamics of interactions across modalities, particularly in presence of complex intra- and inter-modality correlations. Recent advancements in State Space Models (SSMs), notably exemplified by the Mamba model, have emerged as promising contenders. Particularly, its state evolving process implies stronger modality fusion paradigm, making multi-modal fusion on SSMs an appealing direction. However, fusing multiple modalities is challenging for SSMs due to its hardware-aware parallelism designs. To this end, this paper proposes the Coupled SSM model, for coupling state chains of multiple modalities while maintaining independence of intra-modality state processes. Specifically, in our coupled scheme, we devise an inter-modal hidden states transition scheme, in which the current state is dependent on the states of its own chain and that of the neighbouring chains at the previous time-step. To fully comply with the hardware-aware parallelism, we devise an expedite coupled state transition scheme and derive its corresponding global convolution kernel for parallelism. Extensive experiments on CMU-MOSEI, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMSV2 through multi-domain input verify the effectiveness of our model compared to current state-of-the-art methods, improved F1-Score by 0.4\\%, 0.9\\%, and 2.3\\% on the three datasets respectively, 49\\% faster inference and 83.7\\% GPU memory save. The results demonstrate that Coupled Mamba model is capable of enhanced multi-modal fusion.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/22 (Score: 0.85)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 58th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pages 3718-3727, 2020.

Remember the Past: Distilling Datasets into Addressable Memories for Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Zhiwei Deng, Olga Russakovsky*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an algorithm that compresses the critical information of a large dataset into compact addressable memories. These memories can then be recalled to quickly re-train a neural network and recover the performance (instead of storing and re-training on the full original dataset). Building upon the dataset distillation framework, we make a key observation that a shared common representation allows for more efficient and effective distillation. Concretely, we learn a set of bases (aka ``memories'') which are shared between classes and combined through learned flexible addressing functions to generate a diverse set of training examples. This leads to several benefits: 1) the size of compressed data does not necessarily grow linearly with the number of classes; 2) an overall higher compression rate with more effective distillation is achieved; and 3) more generalized queries are allowed beyond recalling the original classes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art results on the dataset distillation task across six benchmarks, including up to 16.5% and 9.7% in retained accuracy improvement when distilling CIFAR10 and CIFAR100 respectively. We then leverage our framework to perform continual learning, achieving state-of-the-art results on four benchmarks, with 23.2% accuracy improvement on MANY.

Many successful building blocks, e.g. inception and residual modules, have been designed to refresh state-of-the-art records of CNNs on visual recognition tasks. Beyond these high-level modules, we suggest that an ordinary \ufb01lter in the neural network can be upgraded to a sophisticated module as well. Filter modules are established by assem-bling a shared set of Lego \ufb01lters that are often of much lower dimensions. Weights in Lego \ufb01lters and binary masks to stack Lego \ufb01lters for these \ufb01lter modules can be simultaneously optimized in an end-to-end manner as usual. Inspired by network engineering, we develop a split-transform-merge strategy for an ef\ufb01cient convolution by exploiting intermediate Lego feature maps. The compression and acceleration achieved by Lego Networks using the proposed Lego \ufb01lters have been theoretically discussed.

Recently, there has been significant interest in utilizing this information in the context of deep neural networks; however, relatively little is known about the quality of existing approximations in this context. Our work examines this question, identifies issues with existing approaches, and proposes a method called WoodFisher to compute a faithful and efficient estimate of the inverse Hessian. \nOur main application is to neural network compression, where we build on the classic Optimal Brain Damage/Surgeon framework. We demonstrate that WoodFisher significantly outperforms popular state-of-the-art methods for one-shot pruning. Further, even when iterative, gradual pruning is considered, our method results in a gain in test accuracy over the state-of-the-art approaches, for pruning popular neural networks (like ResNet-50, MobileNetV1) trained on standard image classification datasets such as ImageNet ILSVRC. We examine how our method can be extended to take into account first-order information, as well as illustrate its ability to automatically set layer-wise pruning thresholds and perform compression in the limited-data regime.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 137  (*Influential: 14*)\n\n#### 4. ScaleCom: Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression for Communication-Efficient Distributed Training\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Chia-Yu Chen, Jiamin Ni, Songtao Lu, Xiaodong Cui, Pin-Yu Chen, Xiao Sun, Naigang Wang, Swagath Venkataramani, Vijayalakshmi Srinivasan, Wei Zhang, K. Gopalakrishnan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability and provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques.\n\n**Abstract:** Large-scale distributed training of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) on state-of-the-art platforms is expected to be severely communication constrained. To overcome this limitation, numerous gradient compression techniques have been proposed and have demonstrated high compression ratios. However, most existing methods do not scale well to large scale distributed systems (due to gradient build-up) and/or fail to evaluate model fidelity (test accuracy) on large datasets. To mitigate these issues, we propose a new compression technique, Scalable Sparsified Gradient Compression (ScaleCom), that leverages similarity in the gradient distribution amongst learners to provide significantly improved scalability. Using theoretical analysis, we show that ScaleCom provides favorable convergence guarantees and is compatible with gradient all-reduce techniques. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate that ScaleCom has small overheads, directly reduces gradient traffic and provides high compression rates (65-400X) and excellent scalability (up to 64 learners and 8-12X larger batch sizes over standard training) across a wide range of applications (image, language, and speech) without significant accuracy loss.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 60  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n#### 5. Entroformer: A Transformer-based Entropy Model for Learned Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Yichen Qian, Ming Lin, Xiuyu Sun, Zhiyu Tan, Rong Jin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently and achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Abstract:** One critical component in lossy deep image compression is the entropy model, which predicts the probability distribution of the quantized latent representation in the encoding and decoding modules. Previous works build entropy models upon convolutional neural networks which are inefficient in capturing global dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel transformer-based entropy model, termed Entroformer, to capture long-range dependencies in probability distribution estimation effectively and efficiently. Different from vision transformers in image classification, the Entroformer is highly optimized for image compression, including a top-k self-attention and a diamond relative position encoding. Meanwhile, we further expand this architecture with a parallel bidirectional context model to speed up the decoding process. The experiments show that the Entroformer achieves state-of-the-art performance on image compression while being time-efficient.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 107  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. EPTQ: Enhanced Post-Training Quantization via Hessian-guided Network-wise Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Hai Victor Habi, Elad Cohen, Arnon Netzer, Ofir Gordon*\n\n**Abstract:** Quantization is a key method for deploying deep neural networks on edge devices with limited memory and computation resources. Recent improvements in Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods were achieved by an additional local optimization process for learning the weight quantization rounding policy. However, a gap exists when employing network-wise optimization with small representative datasets. In this paper, we propose a new method for enhanced PTQ (EPTQ) that employs a network-wise quantization optimization process, which benefits from considering cross-layer dependencies during optimization. EPTQ enables network-wise optimization with a small representative dataset using a novel sample-layer attention score based on a label-free Hessian matrix upper bound. The label-free approach makes our method suitable for the PTQ scheme. We give a theoretical analysis for the said bound and use it to construct a knowledge distillation loss that guides the optimization to focus on the more sensitive layers and samples. In addition, we leverage the Hessian upper bound to improve the weight quantization parameters selection by focusing on the more sensitive elements in the weight tensors. Empirically, by employing EPTQ we achieve state-of-the-art results on various models, tasks, and datasets, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, and Pascal-VOC for semantic segmentation.\n\n**Published:** 2023-09-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. HPTQ: Hardware-Friendly Post Training Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Arnon Netzer, Roy H. Jennings, Idit Diamant, Oranit Dror, Lior Dikstein, Elad Cohen, Reuven Peretz, Hai Victor Habi*\n\n**Abstract:** Neural network quantization enables the deployment of models on edge devices. An essential requirement for their hardware efficiency is that the quantizers are hardware-friendly: uniform, symmetric, and with power-of-two thresholds. To the best of our knowledge, current post-training quantization methods do not support all of these constraints simultaneously. In this work, we introduce a hardware-friendly post training quantization (HPTQ) framework, which addresses this problem by synergistically combining several known quantization methods. We perform a large-scale study on four tasks: classification, object detection, semantic segmentation and pose estimation over a wide variety of network architectures. Our extensive experiments show that competitive results can be obtained under hardware-friendly constraints.\n\n**Published:** 2021-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Dataset Distillation with Infinitely Wide Convolutional Networks\n\n*From Search Query: efficient state compression neural networks*\n\n*Jaehoon Lee, Lechao Xiao, Roman Novak, Timothy Nguyen*\n\n**Abstract:** The effectiveness of machine learning algorithms arises from being able to extract useful features from large amounts of data. As model and dataset sizes increase, dataset distillation methods that compress large datasets into significantly smaller yet highly performant ones will become valuable in terms of training efficiency and useful feature extraction. To that end, we apply a novel distributed kernel based meta-learning framework to achieve state-of-the-art results for dataset distillation using infinitely wide convolutional neural networks. For instance, using only 10 datapoints (0.02% of original dataset), we obtain over 65% test accuracy on CIFAR-10 image classification task, a dramatic improvement over the previous best test accuracy of 40%. Our state-of-the-art results extend across many other settings for MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN. Furthermore, we perform some preliminary analyses of our distilled datasets to shed light on how they differ from naturally occurring data.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on efficient state compression techniques that maintain model expressiveness while reducing memory requirements, here are some relevant approaches and findings from the provided sources:\n\n## Efficient State Compression Techniques\n\n### Network Pruning and Compression\nThe paper on \"Efficient Neural Network Pruning Based on Relative Importance\" discusses a method for network pruning that can be applied to reduce the size of neural networks, thereby decreasing their computational costs and memory requirements. This method involves removing specific weights based on their importance, which can be particularly useful for reducing the state size in autoregressive models. The approach includes a novel regularization term to enhance the pruning process, ensuring that the model remains accurate even at high compression rates.\n\n### Optimizer State and Activation Compression\nThe COAT (Compressing Optimizer States and Activations for FP8 Training) framework is another significant contribution. COAT reduces the memory footprint by quantizing optimizer states and activations into lower precision (FP8), which is crucial for memory-efficient training of large models. The method uses Dynamic Range Expansion and Mixed-Granularity Activation Quantization to minimize quantization error and maintain performance. This approach can be adapted to compress the states in autoregressive models, especially during training and inference phases.\n\n## Adaptive and Hierarchical State Management\n\n### Hierarchical Gating Mechanisms\nThe concept of hierarchical gating with learnable bounds, as mentioned in the analysis note, can be applied to manage states more efficiently. This approach allows upper layers to model long-term dependencies and lower layers to model short-term dependencies, which can be integrated into the state management of autoregressive models to handle multi-scale dependencies more effectively[Analysis Note].\n\n### Adaptive State Compression\nIntroducing adaptive state compression based on importance, as suggested in the analysis note, can be a viable strategy. This involves compressing states dynamically based on their relevance to the current context, which can help in reducing memory usage without sacrificing model expressiveness. This approach aligns with the need for better state compression and management techniques mentioned in the analysis[Analysis Note].\n\n## Additional Considerations\n\n### Structured Sparsity and Hardware Utilization\nThe use of structured sparsity, as hinted at in the analysis note, can improve hardware utilization and efficiency. Techniques like those discussed in the network pruning paper can be adapted to introduce structured sparsity, which not only reduces memory but also enhances computational efficiency.\n\n### Combining Different Techniques\nCombining different state compression techniques, such as pruning, quantization, and adaptive compression, can provide a comprehensive solution. For example, using COAT for optimizer and activation compression alongside pruning methods can lead to significant reductions in memory requirements while maintaining model performance.\n\nBy integrating these approaches, researchers can develop more efficient autoregressive language models that balance expressiveness with reduced memory requirements, making them more scalable and efficient for large-scale applications.\n",

However, training and deploying these models can be prohibitively costly for long sequences, as the standard self-attention mechanism of the Transformer uses $O(n^2)$ time and space with respect to sequence length. In this paper, we demonstrate that the self-attention mechanism can be approximated by a low-rank matrix. We further exploit this finding to propose a new self-attention mechanism, which reduces the overall self-attention complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ in both time and space. The resulting linear transformer, the \\textit{Linformer}, performs on par with standard Transformer models, while being much more memory- and time-efficient.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/18 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. $103-112,2019$.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/67 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nSIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 36(3):A1207-A1220, 2014.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/24 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/2106.09685, 2021 .

All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.95)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

Despite its superior practical performance, there has been some lack of fundamental understanding about its theoretical properties. In this work, we address the following open research question: To train an overparameterized model over a set of distributed nodes, what is the minimum communication overhead (in terms of the bits got exchanged) that the system needs to sustain, while still achieving (near) zero training loss? We show that for a class of overparameterized models where the number of parameters D is much larger than the total data samples N , the best possible communication complexity is \u2326 ( N ) , which is independent of the problem dimension D . Further, for a few speci\ufb01c overparameterized models (i.e., the linear regression, and certain multi-layer neural network with one wide layer), we develop a set of algorithms which uses certain linear compression followed by adaptive quantization, and show that they achieve dimension independent, near-optimal communication complexity.

Deep Compression: Compressing Deep Neural Network with Pruning, Trained Quantization and Huffman Coding\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression adaptive quantization*\n\n*Song Han, Huizi Mao, W. Dally*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces \"deep compression\", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks are both computationally intensive and memory intensive, making them difficult to deploy on embedded systems with limited hardware resources. To address this limitation, we introduce \"deep compression\", a three stage pipeline: pruning, trained quantization and Huffman coding, that work together to reduce the storage requirement of neural networks by 35x to 49x without affecting their accuracy. Our method first prunes the network by learning only the important connections. Next, we quantize the weights to enforce weight sharing, finally, we apply Huffman coding. After the first two steps we retrain the network to fine tune the remaining connections and the quantized centroids. Pruning, reduces the number of connections by 9x to 13x; Quantization then reduces the number of bits that represent each connection from 32 to 5. On the ImageNet dataset, our method reduced the storage required by AlexNet by 35x, from 240MB to 6.9MB, without loss of accuracy. Our method reduced the size of VGG-16 by 49x from 552MB to 11.3MB, again with no loss of accuracy. This allows fitting the model into on-chip SRAM cache rather than off-chip DRAM memory. Our compression method also facilitates the use of complex neural networks in mobile applications where application size and download bandwidth are constrained. Benchmarked on CPU, GPU and mobile GPU, compressed network has 3x to 4x layerwise speedup and 3x to 7x better energy efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 8227  (*Influential: 820*)\n\n#### 4.

BSQ: Exploring Bit-Level Sparsity for Mixed-Precision Neural Network Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression adaptive quantization*\n\n*Huanrui Yang, Lin Duan, Yiran Chen, Hai Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Mixed-precision quantization can potentially achieve the optimal tradeoff between performance and compression rate of deep neural networks, and thus, have been widely investigated. However, it lacks a systematic method to determine the exact quantization scheme. Previous methods either examine only a small manually-designed search space or utilize a cumbersome neural architecture search to explore the vast search space. These approaches cannot lead to an optimal quantization scheme efficiently. This work proposes bit-level sparsity quantization (BSQ) to tackle the mixed-precision quantization from a new angle of inducing bit-level sparsity. We consider each bit of quantized weights as an independent trainable variable and introduce a differentiable bit-sparsity regularizer. BSQ can induce all-zero bits across a group of weight elements and realize the dynamic precision reduction, leading to a mixed-precision quantization scheme of the original model. Our method enables the exploration of the full mixed-precision space with a single gradient-based optimization process, with only one hyperparameter to tradeoff the performance and compression. BSQ achieves both higher accuracy and higher bit reduction on various model architectures on the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets comparing to previous methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 56  (*Influential: 7*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. A Winning Hand: Compressing Deep Networks Can Improve Out-Of-Distribution Robustness\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression adaptive quantization*\n\n*Bhavya Kailkhura, Jize Zhang, Shreya Chaganti, Brian R. Bartoldson, James Diffenderfer*\n\n**Abstract:** Successful adoption of deep learning (DL) in the wild requires models to be: (1) compact, (2) accurate, and (3) robust to distributional shifts. Unfortunately, efforts towards simultaneously meeting these requirements have mostly been unsuccessful. This raises an important question: Is the inability to create Compact, Accurate, and Robust Deep neural networks (CARDs) fundamental? To answer this question, we perform a large-scale analysis of popular model compression techniques which uncovers several intriguing patterns. Notably, in contrast to traditional pruning approaches (e.g., fine tuning and gradual magnitude pruning), we find that \"lottery ticket-style\" approaches can surprisingly be used to produce CARDs, including binary-weight CARDs. Specifically, we are able to create extremely compact CARDs that, compared to their larger counterparts, have similar test accuracy and matching (or better) robustness -- simply by pruning and (optionally) quantizing. Leveraging the compactness of CARDs, we develop a simple domain-adaptive test-time ensembling approach (CARD-Decks) that uses a gating module to dynamically select appropriate CARDs from the CARD-Deck based on their spectral-similarity with test samples. The proposed approach builds a \"winning hand'' of CARDs that establishes a new state-of-the-art (on RobustBench) on CIFAR-10-C accuracies (i.e., 96.8% standard and 92.75% robust) and CIFAR-100-C accuracies (80.6% standard and 71.3% robust) with better memory usage than non-compressed baselines (pretrained CARDs and CARD-Decks available at https://github.com/RobustBench/robustbench). Finally, we provide theoretical support for our empirical findings.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-16\n\n\n\n#### 2. Neural Network Compression Framework for fast model inference\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression adaptive quantization*\n\n*Yury Gorbachev, Vasily Shamporov, Nikolay Lyalyushkin, Ivan Lazarevich, Alexander Kozlov*\n\n**Abstract:** In this work we present a new framework for neural networks compression with fine-tuning, which we called Neural Network Compression Framework (NNCF). It leverages recent advances of various network compression methods and implements some of them, such as sparsity, quantization, and binarization. These methods allow getting more hardware-friendly models which can be efficiently run on general-purpose hardware computation units (CPU, GPU) or special Deep Learning accelerators. We show that the developed methods can be successfully applied to a wide range of models to accelerate the inference time while keeping the original accuracy. The framework can be used within the training samples, which are supplied with it, or as a standalone package that can be seamlessly integrated into the existing training code with minimal adaptations. Currently, a PyTorch version of NNCF is available as a part of OpenVINO Training Extensions at https://github.com/openvinotoolkit/nncf.\n\n**Published:** 2020-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 3. QARV: Quantization-Aware ResNet VAE for Lossy Image Compression\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression adaptive quantization*\n\n*Zhan Ma, Yuning Huang, Fengqing Zhu, Jack Ma, Ming Lu, Zhihao Duan*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper addresses the problem of lossy image compression, a fundamental problem in image processing and information theory that is involved in many real-world applications. We start by reviewing the framework of variational autoencoders (VAEs), a powerful class of generative probabilistic models that has a deep connection to lossy compression. Based on VAEs, we develop a novel scheme for lossy image compression, which we name quantization-aware ResNet VAE (QARV). Our method incorporates a hierarchical VAE architecture integrated with test-time quantization and quantization-aware training, without which efficient entropy coding would not be possible. In addition, we design the neural network architecture of QARV specifically for fast decoding and propose an adaptive normalization operation for variable-rate compression. Extensive experiments are conducted, and results show that QARV achieves variable-rate compression, high-speed decoding, and a better rate-distortion performance than existing baseline methods. The code of our method is publicly accessible at https://github.com/duanzhiihao/lossy-vae\n\n**Published:** 2023-02-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) with efficient state management and memory optimization, several adaptive compression and quantization techniques can be considered based on the provided analysis and keywords.\n\n## Adaptive Quantization and Compression\n\n### Mixed-Precision Quantization and Dynamic Pruning\nThe paper on \"MC-MoE: Mixture Compressor for Mixture-of-Experts LLMs\" introduces a method that combines static quantization and dynamic pruning. This approach, known as Pre-Loading Mixed-Precision Quantization (PMQ) and Online Dynamic Pruning (ODP), allows for the compression of Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models to ultra-low bit-widths while maintaining performance. The method dynamically adjusts the quantization bit-width based on the importance and activation frequencies of experts, which is crucial for adaptive compression.\n\n### Quantization-Aware Training (QAT)\nThe work on implicit neural representation (INR) for video compression also employs quantization-aware training (QAT), which introduces quantization noise during training to prevent the zero-gradient problem. This approach allows for the quantization of network parameters to lower precision (e.g., 6 bits) without significant loss in performance. This technique can be adapted for LMs to achieve efficient compression while preserving model performance.\n\n### Adaptive Weight Quantization\nSong Han's work on \"Deep Compression\" and related techniques, such as SmoothQuant and AWQ (Adaptive Weight Quantization), provides methods for efficient quantization that can be dynamically adjusted. AWQ, in particular, is integrated into various platforms and allows for the quantization of weights in a way that minimizes performance loss, which is beneficial for adaptive state management in LMs.\n\n## Hierarchical and Selective Compression\n\n### Hierarchical State Organization\nThe concept of hierarchical state organization, as seen in the Hierarchically Gated Recurrent Neural Network (HGRN), can be combined with compression techniques. By applying layer-specific compression strategies based on the importance and the learnable bounds of the gates, LMs can achieve more efficient state representation and compression.\n\n### Selective State Processing\nThe Mamba model's selective state space approach can be integrated with compression methods. By selectively processing and compressing states based on input content, LMs can improve efficiency. This content-based selection can be combined with adaptive quantization to enhance state processing and reduce memory usage.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Hardware-Aware Quantization\nThe work by Song Han and his team emphasizes the importance of hardware-aware neural architecture search and quantization. Techniques like SmoothQuant and AWQ are designed to be efficient on various hardware platforms, which is crucial for deploying compressed LMs on resource-constrained devices.\n\n### Memory Hierarchy Optimization\nOptimizing memory access patterns, as seen in FlashAttention, is essential for efficient state management. Applying tiling strategies and other memory hierarchy optimizations can significantly reduce the memory reads/writes, which aligns with the need for hardware-efficient implementations of state space models.\n\nBy integrating these adaptive quantization, dynamic pruning, and hierarchical compression techniques, researchers can develop more efficient autoregressive language models that optimize state management and memory usage, leading to better scalability and performance.\n",

Training LLMs over Neurally Compressed Text (Avg. Score: 0.41)\n\n*Brian Lester, Jaehoon Lee, A. Alemi, Jeffrey Pennington, Adam Roberts, Jascha Narain Sohl-Dickstein, Noah Constant*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length, is proposed, demonstrating effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks.\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we explore the idea of training large language models (LLMs) over highly compressed text. While standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression. If it were possible to train LLMs directly over neurally compressed text, this would confer advantages in training and serving efficiency, as well as easier handling of long text spans. The main obstacle to this goal is that strong compression tends to produce opaque outputs that are not well-suited for learning. In particular, we find that text na\\\"ively compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by LLMs. To overcome this, we propose Equal-Info Windows, a novel compression technique whereby text is segmented into blocks that each compress to the same bit length. Using this method, we demonstrate effective learning over neurally compressed text that improves with scale, and outperforms byte-level baselines by a wide margin on perplexity and inference speed benchmarks. While our method delivers worse perplexity than subword tokenizers for models trained with the same parameter count, it has the benefit of shorter sequence lengths. Shorter sequence lengths require fewer autoregressive generation steps, and reduce latency. Finally, we provide extensive analysis of the properties that contribute to learnability, and offer concrete suggestions for how to further improve the performance of high-compression tokenizers.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 5/68 (Score: 0.44)*\n\n```\n2022 ), and even in settings where models do learn to copy the behavior of another network (Hinton et al. |2015), this is often only when looking at which symbol was assigned the highest probability - the actual probabilities assigned often differ (Stanton et al, 2021). Second, M2 needs to learn the compression procedure itself. In our case, this means tracking the Arithmetic Coding algorithm, which requires maintaining high-precision numerical state across long contexts. We investigate these sub-tasks in detail in Section 5.2 . A further learnability challenge is the high level of context sensitivity needed to interpret a bitstream of compressed text. When chunked into tokens, a particular bit subsequence (e.g., 10111001) can map onto the same token despite having no stable \"meaning\" across occurrences. We show examples in Section 6.1, where a token maps to many different underlying text forms, necessitating strong contextual understanding. While LLMs are robust to some level of polysemy, as highlighted by the success of Hash Embeddings (Tito Svenstrup et al. 2017) where multiple unrelated words share a single token representation, we suspect this has its limits. [^2]Numerical Stability An additional technical challenge is that compression methods can be sensitive to the precise model probabilities used. To achieve lossless compression in our setup, it is critical that the M1 probabilities match during compression and decompression. This can be hard to guarantee in practice, as there are many sources of numerical noise in LLM inference, especially when running on parallel hardware. An expanded discussion of numerical stability issues can be found in Section 3.7\n\nMulti-Model Inference Finally, a specific challenge of training over neurally compressed text is that multiple models need to be stored and run side-by-side in order to perform inference. We assume that if M1 is relatively small, this additional overhead is not a significant drawback compared to a standard tokenizer, which is also a separate model that is needed to tokenize text input and detokenize LLM outputs. In evaluating our approach, we include M1 compute in our calculations of total inference cost (FLOPs/byte). ### 2.3 Compression\n\nIn this work, we focus on lossless compression, which aims to encode a sequence of input symbols, $x_{0: N}=$ $\\left\\{x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{N}\\right\\} \\in X^{|V|}$, into a bitstream while minimizing the expected length of the bitstream. Compression methods are often factored into a \"modeling\" component and a \"coding\" component (Mahoney, 2013). The input sequence can be viewed as a sample from a true distribution $p, x_{0: N} \\sim p$, with a standard autoregressive decomposition, $p\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N} p\\left(x_{i} \\mid x_{0}, \\ldots, x_{i-1}\\right)$. The \"modeling\" component aims to approximate $p$ with $\\hat{p}$. While some compression algorithms assume static probabilities for each symbol, stronger algorithms are \"adaptive\", meaning that symbol probabilities may change based on context. In this work, we use context-aware transformer-based language models to represent $\\hat{p}$. The \"coding\" component of a compression algorithm converts the input sequence to a bitstream of length $\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)$. To maximize compression, we want a coding algorithm that minimizes the expected number of bits in the bitstream, $L:=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[\\ell\\left(x_{0: N}\\right)\\right]$. This is done by assigning shorter bit sequences to common symbols and longer sequences to less common ones ${ }^{8}$ The expected length is lower bounded by $L \\geq H(p)$ where $H(p):=\\mathbb{E}_{x_{0: N} \\sim p}\\left[-\\log _{2} p(x)\\right]$ Shannon, 1948). This means that, given a near-optimal coding algorithm, the achievable level of compression derives from how well the model $\\hat{p}$ approximates $p$. ### 2.4 Arithmetic Coding\n\nArithmetic Coding Rissanen, 1976 Pasco, 1977) uses a model $\\hat{p}$ to compresses a sequence $x_{0: N}$ to a bitstream, which is the binary expansion of a float $f \\in[0,1)$.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/68 (Score: 0.38)*\n\n```\nWhile standard subword tokenizers compress text by a small factor, neural text compressors can achieve much higher rates of compression.

The tokenizers used to produce these tokens-often BPE (Gage, 1994, Sennrich et al., 2016) or Unigram (Kudo, 2018), as implemented by the SentencePiece library (Kudo \\& Richardson, 2018) \u2014are compressors that typically achieve $\\sim 4 \\times$ compression over natural language text (Xue et al., 2022) ${ }^{1}$ While these tokenizers \"hide\" the character-level makeup of each token from the LLM (Xue et al. 2022, Liu et al., 2023), this downside is widely seen as outweighed by the significant benefits of compression. Compared to raw byte-level models, an LLM trained over subword tokens sees $\\sim 4 \\times$ more text per token, allowing it to model longer-distance dependencies, ingest more pretraining data, and predict more text at inference time, all without increasing compute ${ }^{2}$\n\nGiven these advantages, it raises the question, could we compress text further to achieve even greater gains? It is well known that autoregressive language models can be turned into lossless text compressors, and recent work has shown that LLMs can easily achieve $12 \\times$ compression over English text (Del\u00e9tang et al., 2024) ${ }^{3}$ Can we simply train an LLM over this neurally compressed text? [^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_65bb68439ece380b605cg-02.jpg?height=1047&width=1250&top_left_y=271&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: An overview of our approach for training an LLM (M2) over neurally compressed text. First, M1 is trained as a standard byte-level language model-given a leftward context, M1 assigns a probability to each possible following byte. Next, corpus text is compressed into a bitstream using M1 as a compressor. Specifically, the probabilities that M1 assigns at each text position are fed into a compression algorithm like Arithmetic Coding that supports using dynamic symbol probabilities. Finally, this bitstream is chunked into tokens (e.g., 8-bit chunks), and M2 is trained as a language model over compressed text. In this paper we explore various options for doing so, focusing primarily on the idea of using Arithmetic Coding (AC) Witten et al., 1987), which is known to reach the near-optimal compression rate for a particular model that assigns probabilities to text continuations. Figure 1 presents our high-level approach. First, a small language model \"M1\" is trained over raw byte sequences. Next, this frozen model is used to compress pretraining corpus text by applying a standard compression algorithm like AC. The resulting compressed bitstream is then chunked into tokens, which are used to train \"M2\", a language model that directly reads and writes neural-compressed text. Given a perfect probabilistic model of the raw byte sequence, the compression step would output a fullycompressed bitstream that would be indistinguishable from random noise, and hence unlearnable by M2. In reality, M1 can never be perfect (Zvonkin \\& Levin, 2007), so the M1-compressed output will still contain learnable patterns. We explore whether using compression powered by a relatively small M1 is able to \"remove\" the simple structure that M1 understands from the input - e.g., patterns of spelling, word frequency, and basic grammar-while retaining any higher-level structure that M1 fails to model-e.g., patterns requiring \"deeper\" reasoning and long range coherence. A larger M2 would then learn to model this higher-level structure, without needing to relearn the low-level structure removed by M1 ${ }_{4}^{4}$ In theory, this process could be repeated by training an even-larger M3 model on text compressed by M2, and so on. In practice, we find that text compressed via Arithmetic Coding is not readily learnable by a standard transformer-based LLM, with resulting models predicting tokens at chance. Interestingly, this result holds\n\n[^1]even when M1 is reduced to a context-free unigram model, suggesting that the challenge of modeling ACcompressed text stems from the difficulty of learning the AC compression and decompression process itself. We verify this hypothesis by showing that even the sub-tasks of AC-compressing and AC-decompressing text are not learned well beyond a few initial tokens. To aid learnability, we propose compression via Equal-Info Windows, a simple technique that breaks text into contiguous windows and compresses them via Arithmetic Coding independently. Rather than splitting text into windows of equal text length, we track the number of bits output by the compressor, and close each window just before it exceeds a set information threshold (e.g., 32 bits of information). This has the advantage that when chunking the subsequent bitstream into M2 tokens, there is a stable mapping from N tokens to one window (e.g., four 8 -bit tokens $\\Rightarrow$ one 32 -bit window). At each window boundary, we reset both AC algorithm and the M1 model context. This ensures that each window may be mapped back onto raw text without any additional information. Through ablations on window size and M2 vocabulary size, we find that Equal-Info Windows make learning of AC-compressed text possible across a range of settings. However, we also observe that learning progresses gradually, starting with tokens at the left edge of each window, and for longer windows, the model learns little about the tokens near the right edge. Our best-performing setting uses short 16 -bit windows that each correspond to a single 16-bit M2 token. Despite resetting the compression algorithm every 16 bits, we still achieve $\\sim 5.3 \\times$ token-level compression overall, which exceeds standard subword tokenizers. Remarkably, our best M2 models outperform byte-level baselines on perplexity benchmarks (bits/byte) for fixed computation budget (FLOPs/byte). This shows that learning over neural-compressed text can be effective. At the same time, our best M2 models underperform subword baselines. We suspect this is due at least in part to the relatively unstable mappings our neural tokenizers induce between words and tokens. By contrast, standard subword tokenizers induce essentially stable word-to-token mappings, which likely makes the token sequences they output well-suited for LLM training. We illustrate this contrast through qualitative examples. Whether a neural tokenizer can reach a high level of compression while maintaining high learnability for LLM training is an interesting question for future research. Our main contributions are as follows: (1) Outline advantages and challenges of training over neurally compressed text. (2) Compare LLMs trained over different tokenizers along two axes: bits/byte and FLOPs/byte. (3) Show that standard LLMs can't learn to model vanilla AC-compressed text. (4) Show that GZip-compressed text is learnable by standard LLMs, but not competitive. (5) Propose compression via Equal-Info Windows, and show that it enables learning over neurally compressed text. ## 2 Motivation and Background\n\n### 2.1 Advantages of Training over Neurally Compressed Text\n\nTraining LLMs over compressed text is appealing for many reasons.\n```\n\n#### 2. FlashFFTConv: Efficient Convolutions for Long Sequences with Tensor Cores (Avg. Score: 0.28)\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.28)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

However, existing architectures such as Transformers scale quadratically along both these axes. We ask: are there performant architectures that can scale sub-quadratically along sequence length and model dimension? We introduce Monarch Mixer (M2), a new architecture that uses the same sub-quadratic primitive along both sequence length and model dimension: Monarch matrices, a simple class of expressive structured matrices that captures many linear transforms, achieves high hardware efficiency on GPUs, and scales sub-quadratically. As a proof of concept, we explore the performance of M2 in three domains: non-causal BERT-style language modeling, ViT-style image classification, and causal GPT-style language modeling. For non-causal BERT-style modeling, M2 matches BERT-base and BERT-large in downstream GLUE quality with up to 27% fewer parameters, and achieves up to 9.1$\\times$ higher throughput at sequence length 4K. On ImageNet, M2 outperforms ViT-b by 1% in accuracy, with only half the parameters. Causal GPT-style models introduce a technical challenge: enforcing causality via masking introduces a quadratic bottleneck. To alleviate this bottleneck, we develop a novel theoretical view of Monarch matrices based on multivariate polynomial evaluation and interpolation, which lets us parameterize M2 to be causal while remaining sub-quadratic. Using this parameterization, M2 matches GPT-style Transformers at 360M parameters in pretraining perplexity on The PILE--showing for the first time that it may be possible to match Transformer quality without attention or MLPs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/67 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nSIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 36(3):A1207-A1220, 2014.

We focus on designing top-quality LLMs with fewer than a billion parameters, a practical choice for mobile deployment. Contrary to prevailing belief emphasizing the pivotal role of data and parameter quantity in determining model quality, our investigation underscores the significance of model architecture for sub-billion scale LLMs. Leveraging deep and thin architectures, coupled with embedding sharing and grouped-query attention mechanisms, we establish a strong baseline network denoted as MobileLLM, which attains a remarkable 2.7%/4.3% accuracy boost over preceding 125M/350M state-of-the-art models. Additionally, we propose an immediate block-wise weight-sharing approach with no increase in model size and only marginal latency overhead. The resultant models, denoted as MobileLLM-LS, demonstrate a further accuracy enhancement of 0.7%/0.8% than MobileLLM 125M/350M. Moreover, MobileLLM model family shows significant improvements compared to previous sub-billion models on chat benchmarks, and demonstrates close correctness to LLaMA-v2 7B in API calling tasks, highlighting the capability of small models for common on-device use cases.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 28/45 (Score: 0.21)*\n\n```\nIn International Conference on Machine Learning, pp. 31094-31116.

On Distributed Adaptive Optimization with Gradient Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Xiaoyun Li, Belhal Karimi, Ping Li*\n\n**Abstract:** We study COMP-AMS, a distributed optimization framework based on gradient averaging and adaptive AMSGrad algorithm. Gradient compression with error feedback is applied to reduce the communication cost in the gradient transmission process. Our convergence analysis of COMP-AMS shows that such compressed gradient averaging strategy yields same convergence rate as standard AMSGrad, and also exhibits the linear speedup effect w.r.t. the number of local workers. Compared with recently proposed protocols on distributed adaptive methods, COMP-AMS is simple and convenient. Numerical experiments are conducted to justify the theoretical findings, and demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve same test accuracy as the full-gradient AMSGrad with substantial communication savings. With its simplicity and efficiency, COMP-AMS can serve as a useful distributed training framework for adaptive gradient methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 21  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2. Gradient-Free Structured Pruning with Unlabeled Data\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Azade Nova, H. Dai, D. Schuurmans*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data and shows that up to 40% of the original FLOP count can be reduced with less than a 4% accuracy loss across all tasks considered.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in solving difficult tasks across many domains, but such success comes with a high computation cost, and inference latency. As developers and third parties customize these models, the need to provide efficient inference has increased. Many efforts have attempted to reduce inference cost through model compression techniques such as pruning and distillation. However, these techniques either require labeled data, or are time-consuming as they require the compressed model to be retrained to regain accuracy. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data. An evaluation on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks using BERT$_{BASE}$ and DistilBERT illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By only using the weights of the pre-trained model and unlabeled data, in a matter of a few minutes on a single GPU, up to 40% of the original FLOP count can be reduced with less than a 4% accuracy loss across all tasks considered.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 3. Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning for Robust Sparse Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Anna Bair, Hongxu Yin, Maying Shen, Pavlo Molchanov, J. \u00c1lvarez*\n\n**TL;DR:** Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning (AdaSAP) is introduced, which unifies these goals through the lens of network sharpness, and produces sparse networks that are robust to input variations which are unseen at training time.\n\n**Abstract:** Robustness and compactness are two essential attributes of deep learning models that are deployed in the real world. The goals of robustness and compactness may seem to be at odds, since robustness requires generalization across domains, while the process of compression exploits specificity in one domain. We introduce Adaptive Sharpness-Aware Pruning (AdaSAP), which unifies these goals through the lens of network sharpness. The AdaSAP method produces sparse networks that are robust to input variations which are unseen at training time. We achieve this by strategically incorporating weight perturbations in order to optimize the loss landscape. This allows the model to be both primed for pruning and regularized for improved robustness. AdaSAP improves the robust accuracy of pruned models on image classification by up to +6% on ImageNet C and +4% on ImageNet V2, and on object detection by +4% on a corrupted Pascal VOC dataset, over a wide range of compression ratios, pruning criteria, and network architectures, outperforming recent pruning art by large margins.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Gradient-based Intra-attention Pruning on Pre-trained Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Ziqing Yang, Yiming Cui, Xin Yao, Shijin Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models.\n\n**Abstract:** Pre-trained language models achieve superior performance but are computationally expensive. Techniques such as pruning and knowledge distillation have been developed to reduce their sizes and latencies. In this work, we propose a structured pruning method GRAIN (gradient-based intra-attention pruning), which performs task-specific pruning with knowledge distillation and yields highly effective models. Different from common approaches that prune each attention head as a whole, GRAIN inspects and prunes intra-attention structures, which greatly expands the structure search space and enables more flexible models. We also propose a gradient separation strategy that reduces the interference of distillation on pruning for a better combination of the two approaches. Experiments on GLUE, SQuAD, and CoNLL 2003 show that GRAIN notably outperforms other methods, especially in the high sparsity regime, and achieves 6 7x speedups while maintaining 93% 99% performance. Under extreme compression where only 3% transformer weights remain, the pruned model is still competitive compared to larger models.\n\n**Venue:** Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. LLM-Pruner: On the Structural Pruning of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Xinyin Ma, Gongfan Fang, Xinchao Wang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work explores LLM compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM, and adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's functionality.\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in language understanding and generation. However, such impressive capability typically comes with a substantial model size, which presents significant challenges in both the deployment, inference, and training stages. With LLM being a general-purpose task solver, we explore its compression in a task-agnostic manner, which aims to preserve the multi-task solving and language generation ability of the original LLM. One challenge to achieving this is the enormous size of the training corpus of LLM, which makes both data transfer and model post-training over-burdensome. Thus, we tackle the compression of LLMs within the bound of two constraints: being task-agnostic and minimizing the reliance on the original training dataset. Our method, named LLM-Pruner, adopts structural pruning that selectively removes non-critical coupled structures based on gradient information, maximally preserving the majority of the LLM's functionality. To this end, the performance of pruned models can be efficiently recovered through tuning techniques, LoRA, in merely 3 hours, requiring only 50K data. We validate the LLM-Pruner on three LLMs, including LLaMA, Vicuna, and ChatGLM, and demonstrate that the compressed models still exhibit satisfactory capabilities in zero-shot classification and generation.

LoRAPrune: Structured Pruning Meets Low-Rank Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Hao Chen, Bohan Zhuang, Xinyi Yu, Linlin Ou, Zhen Yang, Chunhua Shen, Mingyang Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), such as LLaMA and T5, have shown exceptional performance across various tasks through fine-tuning. Although low-rank adaption (LoRA) has emerged to cheaply fine-tune these LLMs on downstream tasks, their deployment is still hindered by the vast model scale and computational costs. Post-training model pruning offers a way to compress LLMs. However, the current pruning methods designed for LLMs are not compatible with LoRA. This is due to their utilization of unstructured pruning on LLMs, impeding the merging of LoRA weights, or their dependence on the gradients of pre-trained weights to guide pruning, which can impose significant memory overhead. To this end, we propose LoRAPrune, a new framework that delivers an accurate structured pruned model in a highly memory-efficient manner. Specifically, we first design a LoRA-guided pruning criterion, which uses the weights and gradients of LoRA, rather than the gradients of pre-trained weights for importance estimation. We subsequently integrate this criterion into an iterative pruning process, effectively removing redundant channels and heads. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our LoRAPrune over existing approaches on the LLaMA series models. At a 50\\% compression rate, LoRAPrune demonstrates superior performance over LLM-Pruner, achieving a reduction in perplexity by 4.81 on WikiText2 and 3.46 on PTB, while also decreasing memory usage by 52.6%. Besides, LoRAPrune also matches semi-structural pruning across multiple LLMs, proving its wide applicability.

Pruning by Explaining: A Novel Criterion for Deep Neural Network Pruning\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Klaus-Robert M\u00fcller, Seul-Ki Yeom, Philipp Seegerer, Wojciech Samek, Alexander Binder, Simon Wiedemann, Sebastian Lapuschkin*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in various applications is accompanied by a significant increase in computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts to reduce these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various layers while at the same time aiming to not sacrifice performance. In this paper, we propose a novel criterion for CNN pruning inspired by neural network interpretability: The most relevant units, i.e. weights or filters, are automatically found using their relevance scores obtained from concepts of explainable AI (XAI). By exploring this idea, we connect the lines of interpretability and model compression research. We show that our proposed method can efficiently prune CNN models in transfer-learning setups in which networks pre-trained on large corpora are adapted to specialized tasks. The method is evaluated on a broad range of computer vision datasets. Notably, our novel criterion is not only competitive or better compared to state-of-the-art pruning criteria when successive retraining is performed, but clearly outperforms these previous criteria in the resource-constrained application scenario in which the data of the task to be transferred to is very scarce and one chooses to refrain from fine-tuning. Our method is able to compress the model iteratively while maintaining or even improving accuracy. At the same time, it has a computational cost in the order of gradient computation and is comparatively simple to apply without the need for tuning hyperparameters for pruning.\n\n**Published:** 2019-12-18\n\n\n\n#### 3. Learning Accurate Performance Predictors for Ultrafast Automated Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive pruning gradient compression*\n\n*Jie zhou, Shengyu Liu, Han Xiao, Jiwen Lu, Ziwei Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we propose an ultrafast automated model compression framework called SeerNet for flexible network deployment. Conventional non-differen-tiable methods discretely search the desirable compression policy based on the accuracy from exhaustively trained lightweight models, and existing differentiable methods optimize an extremely large supernet to obtain the required compressed model for deployment. They both cause heavy computational cost due to the complex compression policy search and evaluation process. On the contrary, we obtain the optimal efficient networks by directly optimizing the compression policy with an accurate performance predictor, where the ultrafast automated model compression for various computational cost constraint is achieved without complex compression policy search and evaluation. Specifically, we first train the performance predictor based on the accuracy from uncertain compression policies actively selected by efficient evolutionary search, so that informative supervision is provided to learn the accurate performance predictor with acceptable cost. Then we leverage the gradient that maximizes the predicted performance under the barrier complexity constraint for ultrafast acquisition of the desirable compression policy, where adaptive update stepsizes with momentum are employed to enhance optimality of the acquired pruning and quantization strategy. Compared with the state-of-the-art automated model compression methods, experimental results on image classification and object detection show that our method achieves competitive accuracy-complexity trade-offs with significant reduction of the search cost.\n\n**Published:** 2023-04-13\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design using adaptive pruning and gradient-based compression methods, several recent studies and techniques are particularly relevant:\n\n## Adaptive Pruning Techniques\n\n### Dynamic and Context-Aware Pruning\nThe paper on CASAK-V introduces a dynamic sparse attention mechanism combined with adaptive KV-cache compression. This approach dynamically generates and applies head-specific sparse attention patterns, which can be beneficial for maintaining model quality while reducing computational overhead. The method uses a combination of frequency-based and recency-based importance scoring to determine the compression ratio for each key-value pair, which is implemented through pruning and quantization.\n\n### Calibration Data for Pruning\nThe study on the impact of calibration data for pruning large language models highlights the importance of using appropriate calibration data to estimate parameter importance. It suggests that using calibration data similar to the training data can yield better performance, and proposes a self-generating calibration data synthesis strategy. This is crucial for post-training pruning, which does not require iterative training but relies on accurate parameter importance estimation.\n\n### Layer-Wise Compression\nRecent work on layer-wise compression, such as the differentiable pruning framework and outlier-weighted layer-wise sparsity, emphasizes the need for layer-specific compression strategies. These methods optimize pruning rates for each layer, considering the overall model performance rather than applying a uniform sparsity rate across all layers.\n\n## Gradient-Based Compression Methods\n\n### Multi-Stage Compression Pipeline\nThe concept of a multi-stage compression pipeline, as seen in the Deep Compression paper, involves pruning, trained quantization, and Huffman coding. This approach can significantly reduce memory requirements without affecting accuracy. Such a pipeline can be adapted for autoregressive language models to achieve high compression rates while maintaining model quality.\n\n### Bit-Level Sparsity and Mixed-Precision Quantization\nThe BSQ paper introduces bit-level sparsity for mixed-precision neural network quantization, allowing for fine-grained control over compression through a differentiable bit-sparsity regularizer. This method enables the exploration of the full mixed-precision space with a single gradient-based optimization process, which can be highly efficient for autoregressive models[Analysis Note].\n\n### Gradient-Based Optimization for Bit Allocation\nGradient-based optimization for bit allocation, as mentioned in the analysis note, is crucial for mixed-precision quantization. This approach allows for adaptive bit-width adjustment based on importance, which can be integrated into the training process to ensure stability and efficiency[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Compute-In-Memory Compression\nThe paper on improved JPEG lossless compression for intermediate layers in neural networks based on compute-in-memory highlights the importance of hardware-efficient implementations. This method uses predictive coding, quantization, and other techniques to compress intermediate layers efficiently, which can be beneficial for reducing memory footprint and improving inference efficiency in autoregressive models.\n\nBy integrating these adaptive pruning techniques, gradient-based compression methods, and hardware-efficient implementations, researchers can significantly improve the efficiency, scalability, and performance of autoregressive language models.\n",

However, the quadratic computational cost of the attention mechanism limits its practicality for long sequences. There are existing attention variants that improve the computational efficiency, but they have limited ability to effectively compute global information. In parallel to Transformer models, state space models (SSMs) are tailored for long sequences, but they are not flexible enough to capture complicated local information. We propose SPADE, short for $\\underline{\\textbf{S}}$tate s$\\underline{\\textbf{P}}$ace $\\underline{\\textbf{A}}$ugmente$\\underline{\\textbf{D}}$ Transform$\\underline{\\textbf{E}}$r. Specifically, we augment a SSM into the bottom layer of SPADE, and we employ efficient local attention methods for the other layers. The SSM augments global information, which complements the lack of long-range dependency issue in local attention methods. Experimental results on the Long Range Arena benchmark and language modeling tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To further demonstrate the scalability of SPADE, we pre-train large encoder-decoder models and present fine-tuning results on natural language understanding and natural language generation tasks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/35 (Score: 0.82)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the 2013 Conference on\n\nEmpirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, pages 1631-1642, Seattle, Washington, USA.

Score: 0.79)\n\n*Zhen Qin, Weigao Sun, Dong Li, Xuyang Shen, Weixuan Sun, Yiran Zhong*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Lightning Attention-2 is presented, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits and retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.\n\n**Abstract:** Linear attention is an efficient attention mechanism that has recently emerged as a promising alternative to conventional softmax attention. With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

This attention mechanism uses multiple parallel key-value attention blocks (called heads), each performing two fundamental computations: (1) search - selection of a relevant entity from a set via query-key interactions, and (2) retrieval - extraction of relevant features from the selected entity via a value matrix. Importantly, standard attention heads learn a rigid mapping between search and retrieval. In this work, we first highlight how this static nature of the pairing can potentially: (a) lead to learning of redundant parameters in certain tasks, and (b) hinder generalization. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel attention mechanism, called Compositional Attention, that replaces the standard head structure. The proposed mechanism disentangles search and retrieval and composes them in a dynamic, flexible and context-dependent manner through an additional soft competition stage between the query-key combination and value pairing. Through a series of numerical experiments, we show that it outperforms standard multi-head attention on a variety of tasks, including some out-of-distribution settings. Through our qualitative analysis, we demonstrate that Compositional Attention leads to dynamic specialization based on the type of retrieval needed. Our proposed mechanism generalizes multi-head attention, allows independent scaling of search and retrieval, and can easily be implemented in lieu of standard attention heads in any network architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/40 (Score: 0.65)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2012.14601, 2020.

PMLR, 2015. ## APPENDIX\n\n## A RELATED WORK\n\nThe advent of transformer-like models have led to advancements on various flavours of attention based models. This revolution first started with augmenting Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a form of semi-parametric memory structure through attention (Bahdanau et al., 2015) and it soon led to people questioning the need for recurrence. This line of questioning resulted in a famous class of models that get rid of recurrence in favour of just parallel self-attention computations that are quite efficient to do on modern hardware (Vaswani et al., 2017). We briefly discuss the various advances along these lines and distinguish how our proposed attention algorithm is different from them. ## A. 1 ATTENTION\n\nAttention has been a major component of human cognition which allows humans to selectively process relevant information from the plethora of sensory stimulus we receive. The idea of selecting relevant features from a sea of information allows us to make predictions in both a robust as well as compute efficient way. Inspired from neural cognition, there have been a lot of efforts in trying to introduce a notion of attention to relevant states of the input for reliable downstream prediction ( Xu et al., 2015; Luong et al., 2015; Kerg et al., 2020). A major problem in Recurrent Neural Networks based systems is the problem of vanishing and exploding gradients that happens due to improper credit assignment in the model. This is because RNNs model all the information seen up to a certain time through a parametric fixed sized vector which undergoes repeated computations over all time steps. This makes the system brittle to changes in sequence lengths or in presence of long sequence of distracting information. A way to solve this problem was to move away from parametric representations of the entire past and instead rely on dynamic semi-parametric \"memory\" to allow these models to look back whenever needed (Graves et al., 2014; Bahdanau et al., 2015). These works aimed at augmenting recurrence with self-attention and demonstrated that when combined with these cognition-inspired inductive biases, ML systems were able to extrapolate much better to larger sequence lengths. Following this, there has been a lot of recent work that then aimed to remove recurrence between timesteps and rely solely on querying information through self-attention. Recent advances on multiple domains (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2020; Ding et al., 2020; Locatello et al., 2020) showcased that removing recurrence from the picture and relying solely on parallel computations not only leads to significant improvements in performance and generalization but is also easier and faster to train on current hardware. Since the advent of these transformer based models built fundamentally on multi-head attention, the role of attention has become increasingly important across various domains like vision, language and reinforcement learning. It has also led to a lot of research on various architectural choices in fully attention-based systems, some of which we discuss in Appendix A.2. It is, however, important to note that there has been some research that highlight the need for recurrence jointly with self-attention for solving certain logical reasoning tasks efficiently (Hudson \\& Manning, 2018; Selvakumar et al., 2018; Webb et al., 2020). ## A. 2 TRANSFORMER VARIANTS\n\nThe ubiquity of self-attention models in the current ML community has led to tremendous research aimed at incorporating different inductive biases in the attention mechanism used; namely in the multi-head attention. Most of these variants aim to alter multi-head attention in a way that would remove the quadratic time complexity computational bottleneck that is present in standard multi-head attention. However, there are certain works that aim more on the fundamental inductive biases that the attention encodes as opposed to computational benefits. We discuss some of these variants here. Reducing Computational Complexity. Given a set of $n$ vectors, the standard multi-head attention aims to create an $n \\times n$ attention matrix that takes quadratic complexity to compute. This bottleneck prevents usage of self-attention when $n$ is large. In light of this, a lot of recent research aims to reduce this quadratic complexity to $n \\log n$ or linear complexity. This is often achieved by either introducing some restrictions in the $n \\times n$ attention matrix through locality sensitive hashing (Kitaev et al., 2020),\nsparsity (Child et al., 2019), low rank approximation (Wang et al., 2020) or through random features for approximation of softmax (Choromanski et al., 2020).\n```\n\n#### 5.

Kakade, Eran Malach*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2024)\t**Cited by** 25  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n**TL;DR:** It is proved that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state, and a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest is suggested.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are the dominant architecture for sequence modeling, but there is growing interest in models that use a fixed-size latent state that does not depend on the sequence length, which we refer to as\"generalized state space models\"(GSSMs). In this paper we show that while GSSMs are promising in terms of inference-time efficiency, they are limited compared to transformer models on tasks that require copying from the input context. We start with a theoretical analysis of the simple task of string copying and prove that a two layer transformer can copy strings of exponential length while GSSMs are fundamentally limited by their fixed-size latent state. Empirically, we find that transformers outperform GSSMs in terms of efficiency and generalization on synthetic tasks that require copying the context. Finally, we evaluate pretrained large language models and find that transformer models dramatically outperform state space models at copying and retrieving information from context. Taken together, these results suggest a fundamental gap between transformers and GSSMs on tasks of practical interest.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/39 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2301.10743, 2023.

However, incorporating both semantic and syntactic information simultaneously within complex global structures can introduce irrelevant contexts and syntactic dependencies during the process of graph structure learning, potentially resulting in inaccurate predictions.

Specifically,S$^2$GSL is featured with a segment-aware semantic graph learning and a syntax-based latent graph learning enabling the removal of irrelevant contexts and dependencies, respectively. We further propose a self-adaptive aggregation network that facilitates the fusion of two graph learning branches, thereby achieving complementarity across diverse structures.

Towards Deep Attention in Graph Neural Networks: Problems and Remedies\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Soo Yong Lee, Fanchen Bu, Jaemin Yoo, Kijung Shin*\n\n**TL;DR:** AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64).\n\n**Abstract:** Graph neural networks (GNNs) learn the representation of graph-structured data, and their expressiveness can be further enhanced by inferring node relations for propagation. Attention-based GNNs infer neighbor importance to manipulate the weight of its propagation. Despite their popularity, the discussion on deep graph attention and its unique challenges has been limited. In this work, we investigate some problematic phenomena related to deep graph attention, including vulnerability to over-smoothed features and smooth cumulative attention. Through theoretical and empirical analyses, we show that various attention-based GNNs suffer from these problems. Motivated by our findings, we propose AEROGNN, a novel GNN architecture designed for deep graph attention. AERO-GNN provably mitigates the proposed problems of deep graph attention, which is further empirically demonstrated with (a) its adaptive and less smooth attention functions and (b) higher performance at deep layers (up to 64).

Enhancing Adaptive History Reserving by Spiking Convolutional Block Attention Module in Recurrent Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Qi Xu, Yuyuan Gao, Jiangrong Shen, Yaxin Li, Xuming Ran, Huajin Tang, Gang Pan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper develops a recurrent spiking neural network model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns.\n\n**Abstract:** Spiking neural networks (SNNs) serve as one type of efficient model to process spatio-temporal patterns in time series, such as the Address-Event Representation data collected from Dynamic Vision Sensor (DVS). Although convolutional SNNs have achieved remarkable performance on these AER datasets, benefiting from the predominant spatial feature extraction ability of convolutional structure, they ignore temporal features related to sequential time points. In this paper, we develop a recurrent spiking neural network (RSNN) model embedded with an advanced spiking convolutional block attention module (SCBAM) component to combine both spatial and temporal features of spatio-temporal patterns. It invokes the history information in spatial and temporal channels adaptively through SCBAM, which brings the advantages of efficient memory calling and history redundancy elimination. The performance of our model was evaluated in DVS128-Gesture dataset and other time-series datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed SRNN-SCBAM model makes better use of the history information in spatial and temporal dimensions with less memory space, and achieves higher accuracy compared to other models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 7  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Unraveling Feature Extraction Mechanisms in Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xiaobing Sun, Jiaxi Li, Wei Lu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Considering the infinite network width, it is hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening insights into their internal mechanisms and aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.\n\n**Abstract:** The underlying mechanism of neural networks in capturing precise knowledge has been the subject of consistent research efforts. In this work, we propose a theoretical approach based on Neural Tangent Kernels (NTKs) to investigate such mechanisms. Specifically, considering the infinite network width, we hypothesize the learning dynamics of target models may intuitively unravel the features they acquire from training data, deepening our insights into their internal mechanisms. We apply our approach to several fundamental models and reveal how these models leverage statistical features during gradient descent and how they are integrated into final decisions. We also discovered that the choice of activation function can affect feature extraction. For instance, the use of the \\textit{ReLU} activation function could potentially introduce a bias in features, providing a plausible explanation for its replacement with alternative functions in recent pre-trained language models. Additionally, we find that while self-attention and CNN models may exhibit limitations in learning n-grams, multiplication-based models seem to excel in this area. We verify these theoretical findings through experiments and find that they can be applied to analyze language modeling tasks, which can be regarded as a special variant of classification. Our contributions offer insights into the roles and capacities of fundamental components within large language models, thereby aiding the broader understanding of these complex systems.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Demystifying Oversmoothing in Attention-Based Graph Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xinyi Wu, A. Ajorlou, Zihui Wu, A. Jadbabaie*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is established that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially.\n\n**Abstract:** Oversmoothing in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) refers to the phenomenon where increasing network depth leads to homogeneous node representations. While previous work has established that Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) exponentially lose expressive power, it remains controversial whether the graph attention mechanism can mitigate oversmoothing. In this work, we provide a definitive answer to this question through a rigorous mathematical analysis, by viewing attention-based GNNs as nonlinear time-varying dynamical systems and incorporating tools and techniques from the theory of products of inhomogeneous matrices and the joint spectral radius. We establish that, contrary to popular belief, the graph attention mechanism cannot prevent oversmoothing and loses expressive power exponentially. The proposed framework extends the existing results on oversmoothing for symmetric GCNs to a significantly broader class of GNN models, including random walk GCNs, Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and (graph) transformers. In particular, our analysis accounts for asymmetric, state-dependent and time-varying aggregation operators and a wide range of common nonlinear activation functions, such as ReLU, LeakyReLU, GELU and SiLU.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 16  (*Influential: 3*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Self-Adaptive Physics-Informed Neural Networks using a Soft Attention Mechanism\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Ulisses Braga-Neto, Levi McClenny*\n\n**Abstract:** Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged recently as a promising application of deep neural networks to the numerical solution of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). However, it has been recognized that adaptive procedures are needed to force the neural network to fit accurately the stubborn spots in the solution of \"stiff\" PDEs. In this paper, we propose a fundamentally new way to train PINNs adaptively, where the adaptation weights are fully trainable and applied to each training point individually, so the neural network learns autonomously which regions of the solution are difficult and is forced to focus on them. The self-adaptation weights specify a soft multiplicative soft attention mask, which is reminiscent of similar mechanisms used in computer vision. The basic idea behind these SA-PINNs is to make the weights increase as the corresponding losses increase, which is accomplished by training the network to simultaneously minimize the losses and maximize the weights. In addition, we show how to build a continuous map of self-adaptive weights using Gaussian Process regression, which allows the use of stochastic gradient descent in problems where conventional gradient descent is not enough to produce accurate solutions. Finally, we derive the Neural Tangent Kernel matrix for SA-PINNs and use it to obtain a heuristic understanding of the effect of the self-adaptive weights on the dynamics of training in the limiting case of infinitely-wide PINNs, which suggests that SA-PINNs work by producing a smooth equalization of the eigenvalues of the NTK matrix corresponding to the different loss terms. In numerical experiments with several linear and nonlinear benchmark problems, the SA-PINN outperformed other state-of-the-art PINN algorithm in L2 error, while using a smaller number of training epochs.\n\n**Published:** 2020-09-07\n\n\n\n#### 2. Visual Attention Network\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Shi-Min Hu, Ming-Ming Cheng, Zheng-Ning Liu, Cheng-Ze Lu, Meng-Hao Guo*\n\n**Abstract:** While originally designed for natural language processing tasks, the self-attention mechanism has recently taken various computer vision areas by storm. However, the 2D nature of images brings three challenges for applying self-attention in computer vision. (1) Treating images as 1D sequences neglects their 2D structures. (2) The quadratic complexity is too expensive for high-resolution images. (3) It only captures spatial adaptability but ignores channel adaptability. In this paper, we propose a novel linear attention named large kernel attention (LKA) to enable self-adaptive and long-range correlations in self-attention while avoiding its shortcomings. Furthermore, we present a neural network based on LKA, namely Visual Attention Network (VAN). While extremely simple, VAN surpasses similar size vision transformers(ViTs) and convolutional neural networks(CNNs) in various tasks, including image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, panoptic segmentation, pose estimation, etc. For example, VAN-B6 achieves 87.8% accuracy on ImageNet benchmark and set new state-of-the-art performance (58.2 PQ) for panoptic segmentation. Besides, VAN-B2 surpasses Swin-T 4% mIoU (50.1 vs. 46.1) for semantic segmentation on ADE20K benchmark, 2.6% AP (48.8 vs. 46.2) for object detection on COCO dataset.

Selective Kernel Networks\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive attention mechanisms neural networks*\n\n*Xiang Li, Jian Yang, Xiaolin Hu, Wenhai Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** In standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the receptive fields of\nartificial neurons in each layer are designed to share the same size. It is\nwell-known in the neuroscience community that the receptive field size of\nvisual cortical neurons are modulated by the stimulus, which has been rarely\nconsidered in constructing CNNs. We propose a dynamic selection mechanism in\nCNNs that allows each neuron to adaptively adjust its receptive field size\nbased on multiple scales of input information. A building block called\nSelective Kernel (SK) unit is designed, in which multiple branches with\ndifferent kernel sizes are fused using softmax attention that is guided by the\ninformation in these branches. Different attentions on these branches yield\ndifferent sizes of the effective receptive fields of neurons in the fusion\nlayer. Multiple SK units are stacked to a deep network termed Selective Kernel\nNetworks (SKNets). On the ImageNet and CIFAR benchmarks, we empirically show\nthat SKNet outperforms the existing state-of-the-art architectures with lower\nmodel complexity. Detailed analyses show that the neurons in SKNet can capture\ntarget objects with different scales, which verifies the capability of neurons\nfor adaptively adjusting their receptive field sizes according to the input.\nThe code and models are available at https://github.com/implus/SKNet.\n\n**Conference:** selective-kernel-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2019-03-15\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models (LMs) by integrating adaptive attention mechanisms and enhancing efficiency and scalability, here are some key findings and suggestions from the provided sources:\n\n## Adaptive Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Density Adaptive Attention Mechanism (DAAM)\nThe paper on DAAM introduces a novel probabilistic attention framework that can significantly enhance the performance of Transformer models. DAAM integrates learnable mean and variance into its attention mechanism, allowing it to dynamically adjust attention based on input context. This approach enables the model to handle highly non-stationary data more effectively and improves performance by up to 20% in accuracy. The multi-head design of DAAM allows each head to focus on different aspects of the data, enhancing adaptability and robustness.\n\n### Dynamic and Adaptive Attention in AI\nDynamic and adaptive attention mechanisms, inspired by human attentional focus, allow models to shift focus based on task demands and environmental cues. These mechanisms are crucial for improving performance in tasks like natural language processing (NLP), image recognition, and sequence prediction. Multi-head attention, in particular, enables models to attend to multiple aspects of input data simultaneously, enhancing robustness and efficiency.\n\n## Efficiency and Scalability Improvements\n\n### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning\nThe DAAM mechanism is designed for parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT), which is essential for maintaining efficiency. By integrating Gaussian modulation and multi-head attention, DAAM reduces the number of learnable parameters while improving performance. This approach is particularly beneficial for models that need to be fine-tuned across multiple modalities.\n\n### Sparse Attention Mechanisms\nThe use of sparse attention mechanisms can enhance context length without significantly increasing computational costs. This is relevant for improving the efficiency of LMs, as it allows for more comprehensive processing of input data without excessive computational overhead.\n\n### Combining Attention with Sparsity\nThe sTAB-Net model combines attention mechanisms with sparsity to improve performance on tabular data.

Our code will be publicly available. ## 1 Introduction\n\nTransformer models [72] have been considered as a de facto backbone of modeling arbitrary sequences, pretraining foundation models [8, 21], and more recently, constructing large language models (LLMs) [9, 69]. Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 2. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg. Score: 0.84)\n\n*Xuezhe Ma, Xiang Kong, Sinong Wang, Chunting Zhou, Jonathan May, Hao Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2021)\t**Cited by** 94  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Luna is proposed, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear time and space complexity.\n\n**Abstract:** The quadratic computational and memory complexities of the Transformer's attention mechanism have limited its scalability for modeling long sequences. In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.84)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 3. Faster Causal Attention Over Large Sequences Through Sparse Flash Attention (Avg.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 2/38 (Score: 0.80)*\n\n```\nFor these applications, the causal self-attention-which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length\u2014becomes a central concern.

Some methods attempt to linearize the attention (Beltagy et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) by for instance linearizing the softmax operator to take advantage of the associativity of matrix products (Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Other methods rely on a predefined sparse masking of the attention matrix, e.g. to constrain the attention to a local temporal neighborhood (Zaheer et al., 2020; Child et al., 2019). While the structure is fixed, it is assumed that information from arbitrary locations in the sequence can still flow through this structure over several layers. All those methods impose static implicit or explicit constraints over the attention matrix. Another promising line of work consists in computing a dynamic modulation of a sub-part of the attention matrix. They are based, for instance, on dropping keys and queries (Kim et al., 2022) or using geometric hashing of the keys and queries to identify linear cost sub-blocks of the attention matrix that carry most of the weight (Kitaev et al., 2020). [^0]The promising theoretical computational complexity of these methods contrasts with the fact that today's most successfully deployed practical models instead rely on vanilla attention, in part thanks to the efficiency of FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022). This implementation is mathematically identical to the vanilla attention proposed by Vaswani et al. (2017) in their seminal paper, but trades in additional compute for less memory I/O. While still avoiding a memory footprint quadratic with the sequence length, it delivers practical speedups of over $5 \\times$ compared to a naive implementation. Using an attention layer in an autoregressive model-which has been key in the recent remarkable AI breakthroughs-requires to make it causal. This is achieved by applying a mask to the attention matrix, so that information cannot flow from the future to the past during training. While FlashAttention can deal with vanilla causal masks, it does not provide enough flexibility to be used for situations where the causal attention mask is not perfectly regular, that is, lower triangular. This in particular prevents using it for models that dynamically drop keys and queries or rely on geometric hashing, which results in irregular causal structures as illustrated in Fig.\n```\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.53)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.53)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

(2023). More recently, generalized state space models that build on previous research (Martin and Cundy, 2017) (Gu et al., 2021) have shown promise by incorporating data-driven mechanisms to control the evolution of a fixed-size latent state (Peng et al., 2023) (Gu and Dao, 2023) (Katsch, 2023), but their performance is inferior on certain tasks (e.g., recalling arbitrary parts of the input context), motivating the hypothesis that methods with a fixed-size latent space cannot outperform conventional attention (Jelassi et al., 2024). ### 1.1 Modifying Attention\n\nWe find that a simple modification to conventional attention linearizes it (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps, and we show that this modification renders attention expressible as a composition of log-sums of exponentials, with a fixed-size latent space, for sequential application with constant cost per token. We implement our modification, verify that it works, and conclude that it is a promising alternative.

If any of $V$ 's elements are negative, $\\log V$ is complex, and therefore so is $\\log S$, but all Softmax mixtures of $V$ remain over $\\mathbb{R}$ because they are a composition of operations under which $\\mathbb{R}$ is closed (1). ### 1.3 Autoregressive Case\n\nFor autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}=n_{K}$ and for each query at step $t$ we compute attention only over $t$ trailing tokens, we note that in (3), all sequential dependencies are modeled by the logsums computed with $\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$, so we can compute autoregressive $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\times d_{V} \\text { elements }}) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q+\\underbrace{\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)}_{d_{K} \\times n_{K} \\text { elements }})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere the function $\\operatorname{LCSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}(\\cdot)$ computes a logcumulative-sum of exponentials over the dimension indexed by and $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$. For sequential application, given a new query $Q_{t}$ at step $t$, we need only the end-states of the two log-cumulative-sums of exponentials:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(S)}}_{d_{K} \\times d_{V}}) \\\\\n& \\log Z_{t}=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}(Q_{t}+\\underbrace{H_{t}^{(Z)}}_{d_{K}})\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere hidden states $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the states of the two log-cumulative-sums at step $t$ :\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{t}^{(S)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(S)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}+\\log V_{t}\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& H_{t}^{(Z)}=\\log \\left(\\exp \\left(H_{t-1}^{(Z)}\\right)+\\exp \\left(K_{t}\\right)\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwith zeros as their initial condition:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& H_{0}^{(S)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K} \\times d_{V}} \\\\\n& H_{0}^{(Z)}=\\{0\\}^{d_{K}}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nTogether, $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ hold the latent, or hidden, state of autoregressive attention's computation at step $t$. They enable us to compute autoregressive attention sequentially with constant time and space complexity per token, $\\mathcal{O}(1)$. ### 1.4 Non-Autoregressive Case\n\nFor non-autoregressive attention, in which $n_{Q}$ may differ from $n_{K}$ and for each query we compute attention over all tokens in the sequence, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ with (3). For sequential application, in which we add a new token to the input context at step $t$, with key $K_{t}$ and value $V_{t}$, we compute $\\log S$ and $\\log Z$ for all queries from the updated hidden states:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(S)}\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+H_{t}^{(Z)}\\right)\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $H_{t}^{(S)}$ and $H_{t}^{(Z)}$ are the hidden states at step $t$ (6), with zeros as their initial condition (7). ## 2 Proof\n\nGiven a query $q$ and a key $k$ in $\\mathbb{R}^{d_{K}}$, the logarithm of the dot-product of their exponentials is $\\log \\left(\\sum(\\exp (q) \\odot \\exp (k))\\right)=\\operatorname{LSE}(q+k)$, where $\\odot$ denotes an elementwise product. Log-sums of exponentials are associative and commutative, making the proof fairly straightforward. For clarity's sake, we walk step-by-step through a sequence of algebraic manipulations. We start by expanding the Softmax function in (1) and simplifying the resulting expression. We obtain a form of linear attention (Katharopoulos et al., 2020) with exponential kernel feature maps:\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\operatorname{Softmax}\\left(\\log \\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\exp (c)}\\right) V= \\\\\n{\\left[\\frac{\\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V}\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}$ normalizes each row to a probability distribution. The scaling constant $\\exp (c)$ disappears because it becomes a common divisor of numerator and denominator expressions. Note that the feature function corresponding to the exponential kernel is infinite dimensional. Substitute the dot-products of exponentiated queries and exponentiated keys with equivalent explicit summations over elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\left[\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\\right] V\n$$\n\nwhere the elementwise product $\\odot$ is over compatible dimensions, broadcasting over any other dimensions, from left to right, such that the broadcasted elementwise product $\\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}$ has $n_{Q} \\times d_{K} \\times n_{K}$ elements. ${ }^{2}$\nExpress matrix multiplication with $V$ as a summation over broadcasted elementwise products:\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nBoth $\\exp (K)^{T}$ and $V$ have a dimension indexed by $\\left(1,2, \\ldots, n_{K}\\right)$, but $\\exp (Q)$ does not, so we can sum over that dimension before broadcastmultiplying elementwise with $\\exp (Q)$ :\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V}{\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}}\n$$\n\nDefine $S$ and $Z$ as the expressions that compute numerators and denominators, respectively,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& S:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T} \\odot V \\\\\n& Z:=\\sum_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]} \\exp (Q) \\odot \\sum_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]} \\exp (K)^{T}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nand take their logarithms. We obtain:\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& \\log S=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}+\\log V\\right)\\right) \\\\\n& \\log Z=\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[d_{K}\\right]}\\left(Q+\\operatorname{LSE}_{\\left[n_{K}\\right]}\\left(K^{T}\\right)\\right),\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhich is the same as (3). [^1]\n## 3 Implementation\n\nAs proof of concept, we implement our attention mechanism for both autoregressive applications (e.g., generative language modeling) and nonautoregressive applications (e.g., masked language modeling). For simplicity and expediency, we limit our implementation in two significant ways: First, we restrict $V$ to elements $\\geq 0$ to avoid dealing with complex floating-point numbers, which incur greater overhead and are more cumbersome to manipulate than real floating-point numbers with existing software infrastructure. Second, when computing autoregressive attention over $n_{K}$ tokens, we first compute all $n_{K}$ hidden states with a parallel scan, and then reduce them, which is space-inefficient but easier to implement with existing software infrastructure. ${ }^{3}$\n\nWe apply our implementation in a small generative language model ( 125 M parameters, 50257 token ids, 768 embedding features). For numerical stability, in each layer we compute $\\log V$ over $\\mathbb{R}$ directly, with a dense feed-forward transformation of token states, implicitly defining $V$ as $\\log V$ 's exponential but never actually computing it. To remain in $\\mathbb{R}$, we use the logarithm of attention as input to subsequent transformations in the layer, i.e., the input to subsequent transformations is $\\log S-\\log Z$ instead of $\\exp (\\log S-\\log Z)$. Please see our published code for all model details. We train the model on 300B tokens from The Pile (Gao et al., 2020) with a conventional sequence length of 1024 tokens, and obtain a crossentropy loss of 2.47 , competitive with state-of-theart generative language models of similar size. ## 4 Conclusions\n\nBy all indications, our attention mechanism is a promising alternative to the conventional one, but the evidence we have so far is too scant to be conclusive. An adequate comparison requires addressing our implementation's temporary limitations and evaluating models with one to several orders of magnitude more parameters on a diverse set of benchmarks and downstream tasks.

Susskind*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work investigates the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers, and shows that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training a Vision Transformer without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers.\n\n**Abstract:** Training stability is of great importance to Transformers. In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

Meta-Learning for Relative Density-Ratio Estimation\n\n*From Search Query: Density-Adaptive Linear Attention Stability*\n\n*Atsutoshi Kumagai, Tomoharu Iwata, Y. Fujiwara*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets, and model the relative densities by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution.\n\n**Abstract:** The ratio of two probability densities, called a density-ratio, is a vital quantity in machine learning. In particular, a relative density-ratio, which is a bounded extension of the density-ratio, has received much attention due to its stability and has been used in various applications such as outlier detection and dataset comparison. Existing methods for (relative) density-ratio estimation (DRE) require many instances from both densities. However, sufficient instances are often unavailable in practice. In this paper, we propose a meta-learning method for relative DRE, which estimates the relative density-ratio from a few instances by using knowledge in related datasets. Specifically, given two datasets that consist of a few instances, our model extracts the datasets' information by using neural networks and uses it to obtain instance embeddings appropriate for the relative DRE. We model the relative density-ratio by a linear model on the embedded space, whose global optimum solution can be obtained as a closed-form solution. The closed-form solution enables fast and effective adaptation to a few instances, and its differentiability enables us to train our model such that the expected test error for relative DRE can be explicitly minimized after adapting to a few instances. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method by using three problems: relative DRE, dataset comparison, and outlier detection.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 10  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. A Stability-based Validation Procedure for Differentially Private Machine Learning\n\n*From Search Query: Density-Adaptive Linear Attention Stability*\n\n*Kamalika Chaudhuri, S. Vinterbo*\n\n**TL;DR:** A generic validation procedure for differentially private machine learning algorithms that apply when a certain stability condition holds on the training algorithm and the validation performance metric is introduced.\n\n**Abstract:** Differential privacy is a cryptographically motivated definition of privacy which has gained considerable attention in the algorithms, machine-learning and data-mining communities. While there has been an explosion of work on differentially private machine learning algorithms, a major barrier to achieving end-to-end differential privacy in practical machine learning applications is the lack of an effective procedure for differentially private parameter tuning, or, determining the parameter value, such as a bin size in a histogram, or a regularization parameter, that is suitable for a particular application. \n \nIn this paper, we introduce a generic validation procedure for differentially private machine learning algorithms that apply when a certain stability condition holds on the training algorithm and the validation performance metric. The training data size and the privacy budget used for training in our procedure is independent of the number of parameter values searched over. We apply our generic procedure to two fundamental tasks in statistics and machine-learning - training a regularized linear classifier and building a histogram density estimator that result in end-to-end differentially private solutions for these problems.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2013\n\n**Citations:** 86  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 4.

Effective solution of this problem requires adaptation of predictive models trained on the source domain to a target domain, using only unlabeled target domain data, without access to source domain data. Existing test-time adaptation methods for tabular data have difficulty coping with the heterogeneous features and their complex dependencies inherent in tabular data. To overcome these limitations, we consider test-time adaptation in the setting wherein the logical structure of the rules is assumed to remain invariant despite distribution shift between source and target domains whereas the numerical parameters associated with the rules and the weights assigned to them can vary to accommodate distribution shift. TabLog discretizes numerical features, models dependencies between heterogeneous features, introduces a novel contrastive loss for coping with distribution shift, and presents an end-to-end framework for efficient training and test-time adaptation by taking advantage of a logical neural network representation of a rule ensemble. We present results of experiments using several benchmark data sets that demonstrate TabLog is competitive with or improves upon the state-of-the-art methods for test-time adaptation of predictive models trained on tabular data.

Leveraging Proxy of Training Data for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity in Test-Time Adaptation Models*\n\n*Juwon Kang, Nayeong Kim, Donghyeon Kwon, Jungseul Ok, Suha Kwak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them, which enables virtually supervised test-time training and outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disre-gard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 6. How Does Structured Sparsity Work in Abnormal Event Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity in Test-Time Adaptation Models*\n\n*Huamin Ren, Hong Pan, S\u00f8ren Ingvor, T. Moeslund*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithm to solve the abnormality detection problem by sparse representation, in which local structured sparsity is preserved in coefficients is proposed and compared with state-of-the-art on the public dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In traditional sparse modeling, it is assumed that a signal/feature/image can be either accurately or approximately represented by a sparse linear combination of atoms from a learned dictionary. Structured sparsity, which is beyond traditional sparse modeling, addresses collaborative structured sparsity to add stability and prior information to the representation. Specifically, in structured sparse modeling, the atoms are partitioned in groups, and a few groups are selected at a time for the sparse coding. Supposing there are n classes and mi training data for each class i, B[i] = [bi1...bimi ], i = 1...n and each bij \u2208 R , the dictionary of the training data has a block structure where a few blocks of the dictionary correspond to the training data in each class. Thus, a test example can be represented as a linear combination of training data from a few blocks of the dictionary corresponding to its class. Structured sparsity has been found important in computer vision such as face recognition, motion segmentation, and activity recognition, since the data lie in multiple low-dimensional subspaces of a high dimensional ambient space in these applications. In fact, abnormal event detection can be another beneficiary given a testing frame, it should be identified as a normal frame if all the features within the frame preserves a structured sparsity: all features could be linearly represented by only a few atoms, more importantly, these a few atoms come from the same or similar behavior. Otherwise, it should be detected as an abnormal frame. This structured sparsity is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is straightforward to consider structured sparsity algorithms to achieve the structured sparsity shown in Fig. 1. However, it is infeasible to apply structured sparsity algorithms directly in abnormal event detection, which are mainly due to two reasons: 1) abnormal event detection has a highly biased training data only normal videos are used during the training, which is the due to the fact that abnormal videos are limited or even unavailable in advance in most video surveillance applications. As a result, there could be only one label in the training data which hampers supervised learning; 2) Even though there are multiple types of normal behaviors, how many normal patterns lie in the whole surveillance data is still unknown. This is because there is huge amount of video surveillance data and only a small proportion is used in algorithm learning, consequently, the normal patterns in the training data could be incomplete. As a result, any sparse structure learned from the training data could have a high bias and ruin the precision of abnormal event detection. Therefore, we in the paper propose an algorithm to solve the abnormality detection problem by sparse representation, in which local structured sparsity is preserved in coefficients. To better meet the needs of practical video surveillance applications, our method aims at dictionary learning preserving the structured Fig. 1. Ideal structured sparsity in normal and abnormal features. As normal features, their non zeros in coefficients should only distributed in the atoms with the same behavior; as abnormal features, their non zeros in coefficients should spread over atoms. sparsity through a relatively small training data. Our method contains three steps. Step 1: Initial dictionary construction, which selects initial atoms to form multiple dictionaries. These atoms are learned based on visual features; Step 2: Transferring atoms in Step 1 into feature space, and replace atoms in the initial dictionary with new feature atoms; Step 3: Dictionary refinement, which preserves local structured sparsity. We compare our method with state-of-the-art on the public dataset: UCSD anomaly dataset; moreover, we carry our experiments on the Anomaly Stairs dataset with a challenging setting: an incomplete normal patterns or a small set is used for training the model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. Sparse Attention with Linear Units\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparse Linear Attention Implementations*\n\n*Biao Zhang, Ivan Titov, Rico Sennrich*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: it replaces the softmax activation with a ReLU, and shows that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation.\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, it has been argued that encoder-decoder models can be made more interpretable by replacing the softmax function in the attention with its sparse variants. In this work, we introduce a novel, simple method for achieving sparsity in attention: we replace the softmax activation with a ReLU, and show that sparsity naturally emerges from such a formulation. Training stability is achieved with layer normalization with either a specialized initialization or an additional gating function. Our model, which we call Rectified Linear Attention (ReLA), is easy to implement and more efficient than previously proposed sparse attention mechanisms. We apply ReLA to the Transformer and conduct experiments on five machine translation tasks. ReLA achieves translation performance comparable to several strong baselines, with training and decoding speed similar to that of the vanilla attention. Our analysis shows that ReLA delivers high sparsity rate and head diversity, and the induced cross attention achieves better accuracy with respect to source-target word alignment than recent sparsified softmax-based models. Intriguingly, ReLA heads also learn to attend to nothing (i.e. \u2018switch off\u2019) for some queries, which is not possible with sparsified softmax alternatives.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 33  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 8.

To efficiently implement sparse IDS, we propose an empirical Bayesian approach for sparse posterior sampling using a spike-and-slab Gaussian-Laplace prior.

Decomposing the Neurons: Activation Sparsity via Mixture of Experts for Continual Test Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity in Test-Time Adaptation Models*\n\n*Shanghang Zhang, Yanbing Jiang, Yuan Du, Li Du, ran Xu, Jiaming Liu, Huanrui Yang, Gaole Dai, Yulin Luo, Aosong Cheng, Rongyu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), which aims to adapt the pre-trained model to ever-evolving target domains, emerges as an important task for vision models. As current vision models appear to be heavily biased towards texture, continuously adapting the model from one domain distribution to another can result in serious catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from the human visual system's adeptness at processing both shape and texture according to the famous Trichromatic Theory, we explore the integration of a Mixture-of-Activation-Sparsity-Experts (MoASE) as an adapter for the CTTA task. Given the distinct reaction of neurons with low/high activation to domain-specific/agnostic features, MoASE decomposes the neural activation into high-activation and low-activation components with a non-differentiable Spatial Differentiate Dropout (SDD). Based on the decomposition, we devise a multi-gate structure comprising a Domain-Aware Gate (DAG) that utilizes domain information to adaptive combine experts that process the post-SDD sparse activations of different strengths, and the Activation Sparsity Gate (ASG) that adaptively assigned feature selection threshold of the SDD for different experts for more precise feature decomposition. Finally, we introduce a Homeostatic-Proximal (HP) loss to bypass the error accumulation problem when continuously adapting the model. Extensive experiments on four prominent benchmarks substantiate that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks.

Graph Federated Learning for CIoT Devices in Smart Home Applications\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity in Test-Time Adaptation Models*\n\n*Konstantinos N. Plataniotis, Jamshid Abouei, Seyed Mohammad Sheikholeslami, Arash Rasti-Meymandi*\n\n**Abstract:** This paper deals with the problem of statistical and system heterogeneity in a cross-silo Federated Learning (FL) framework where there exist a limited number of Consumer Internet of Things (CIoT) devices in a smart building. We propose a novel Graph Signal Processing (GSP)-inspired aggregation rule based on graph filtering dubbed ``G-Fedfilt''. The proposed aggregator enables a structured flow of information based on the graph's topology. This behavior allows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training domain-specific models. The embedded graph filter is equipped with a tunable parameter which enables a continuous trade-off between domain-agnostic and domain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act similar to the conventional Federated Averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule. The proposed G-Fedfilt also enables an intrinsic smooth clustering based on the graph connectivity without explicitly specified which further boosts the personalization of the models in the framework. In addition, the proposed scheme enjoys a communication-efficient time-scheduling to alleviate the system heterogeneity. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of training data samples and sparsity of the models' gradients to reduce communication desynchronization and latency.

Our NLAIC 1) embeds non-local network operations as non-linear transforms in the encoders and decoders for both the image and the latent representation probability information (known as hyperprior) to capture both local and global correlations, 2) applies attention mechanism to generate masks that are used to weigh the features, which implicitly adapt bit allocation for feature elements based on their importance, and 3) implements the improved conditional entropy modeling of latent features using joint 3D convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoregressive contexts and hyperpriors. Towards the practical application, additional enhancements are also introduced to speed up processing (e.g., parallel 3D CNN-based context prediction), reduce memory consumption (e.g., sparse non-local processing) and alleviate the implementation complexity (e.g., unified model for variable rates without re-training). The proposed model outperforms existing methods on Kodak and CLIC datasets with the state-of-the-art compression efficiency reported, including learned and conventional (e.g., BPG, JPEG2000, JPEG) image compression methods, for both PSNR and MS-SSIM distortion metrics.\n\n**Published:** 2019-10-11\n\n\n\n#### 4. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparse Linear Attention Implementations*\n\n*Seunghoon Hong, Honglak Lee, Moontae Lee, Jinwoo Kim, Seonwoo Min, Sungjun Cho*\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/sc782/SBM-Transformer .\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-27\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the **AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear** model, here are the key points and the most useful information from the provided analysis and references:\n\n### Key Components of the Proposal\n\n1. **Density-Adaptive Attention:**\n   - The proposal involves integrating learnable density parameters into the attention mechanism to dynamically modulate attention weights.

Key Insights and Detailed Analysis**\n\n- **Density-Adaptive Attention Mechanisms:**\n\n  - **Effectiveness:** The concept of integrating learnable density parameters into attention mechanisms to adaptively modulate attention weights shows promise in enhancing model expressiveness and handling non-stationary data. However, there is a gap in existing literature regarding the application of density-adaptive attention in linear attention models, particularly those supporting test-time training.\n\n  - **Implementation Challenges:** Introducing learnable density parameters may pose challenges in terms of numerical stability and computational efficiency.

This would enhance the scalability and practicality of the model for real-world applications.\n\n- **Implementation Considerations:**\n\n  - **Numerical Stability:** Adaptive mechanisms may introduce numerical instability, particularly during training. Exploring methods from related works, such as the stabilization techniques in SEA (Lee et al., 2023) or the attention entropy considerations in Zhai et al. (2023), could be beneficial.\n\n  - **Hardware Efficiency:** Ensuring that the added complexity from adaptive attention and structured sparsity does not negate the efficiency gains is essential.

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 10/30 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nIn Proceedings of the AAAI conference on artificial intelligence, volume 34, pages $7432-7439,2020$.

Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

For these applications, the causal self-attention -- which is the only component scaling quadratically w.r.t. the sequence length -- becomes a central concern. While many works have proposed schemes to sparsify the attention patterns and reduce the computational overhead of self-attention, those are often limited by implementations concerns and end up imposing a simple and static structure over the attention matrix. Conversely, implementing more dynamic sparse attentions often results in runtimes significantly slower than computing the full attention using the Flash implementation from Dao et al. (2022). We extend FlashAttention to accommodate a large class of attention sparsity patterns that, in particular, encompass key/query dropping and hashing-based attention. This leads to implementations with no computational complexity overhead and a multi-fold runtime speedup on top of FlashAttention. Even with relatively low degrees of sparsity, our method improves visibly upon FlashAttention as the sequence length increases. Without sacrificing perplexity, we increase the training speed of a transformer language model by $2.0\\times$ and $3.3\\times$ for sequences of respectively $8k$ and $16k$ tokens.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 17/38 (Score: 0.96)*\n\n```\nBehnke, M. and Heafield, K.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Learning to Incorporate Texture Saliency Adaptive Attention to Image Cartoonization\n\n*From Search Query: Density Adaptive Attention*\n\n*Xiang Gao, Yuqi Zhang, Yingjie Tian*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is demonstrated that texture saliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of related methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in facilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for high-resolution input pictures.\n\n**Abstract:** Image cartoonization is recently dominated by generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of unsupervised image-to-image translation, in which an inherent challenge is to precisely capture and sufficiently transfer characteristic cartoon styles (e.g., clear edges, smooth color shading, abstract fine structures, etc.). Existing advanced models try to enhance cartoonization effect by learning to promote edges adversarially, introducing style transfer loss, or learning to align style from multiple representation space. This paper demonstrates that more distinct and vivid cartoonization effect could be easily achieved with only basic adversarial loss. Observing that cartoon style is more evident in cartoon-texture-salient local image regions, we build a region-level adversarial learning branch in parallel with the normal image-level one, which constrains adversarial learning on cartoon-texture-salient local patches for better perceiving and transferring cartoon texture features. To this end, a novel cartoon-texture-saliency-sampler (CTSS) module is proposed to dynamically sample cartoon-texture-salient patches from training data. With extensive experiments, we demonstrate that texture saliency adaptive attention in adversarial learning, as a missing ingredient of related methods in image cartoonization, is of significant importance in facilitating and enhancing image cartoon stylization, especially for high-resolution input pictures.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3.

NASH: A Simple Unified Framework of Structured Pruning for Accelerating Encoder-Decoder Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Pruning Transformers*\n\n*Jongwoo Ko, Seungjoon Park, Yujin Kim, Sumyeong Ahn, Du-Seong Chang, Euijai Ahn, SeYoung Yun*\n\n**TL;DR:** A simple and effective framework, NASH, is proposed that narrows the encoder and shortens the decoder networks of encoder-decoder models and proves the effectiveness of the method in both speedup and output quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Structured pruning methods have proven effective in reducing the model size and accelerating inference speed in various network architectures such as Transformers. Despite the versatility of encoder-decoder models in numerous NLP tasks, the structured pruning methods on such models are relatively less explored compared to encoder-only models. In this study, we investigate the behavior of the structured pruning of the encoder-decoder models in the decoupled pruning perspective of the encoder and decoder component, respectively. Our findings highlight two insights: (1) the number of decoder layers is the dominant factor of inference speed, and (2) low sparsity in the pruned encoder network enhances generation quality. Motivated by these findings, we propose a simple and effective framework, NASH, that narrows the encoder and shortens the decoder networks of encoder-decoder models. Extensive experiments on diverse generation and inference tasks validate the effectiveness of our method in both speedup and output quality.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. A Fast Post-Training Pruning Framework for Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Pruning Transformers*\n\n*Woosuk Kwon, Sehoon Kim, Michael W. Mahoney, Joseph Hassoun, K. Keutzer, A. Gholami*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a fast post-training pruning framework for Transformers that prunes Transformers in less than 3 minutes on a single GPU, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than existing pruning approaches that retrain the models.\n\n**Abstract:** Pruning is an effective way to reduce the huge inference cost of Transformer models. However, prior work on pruning Transformers requires retraining the models. This can add high training cost and high complexity to model deployment, making it difficult to use in many practical situations. To address this, we propose a fast post-training pruning framework for Transformers that does not require any retraining. Given a resource constraint and a sample dataset, our framework automatically prunes the Transformer model using structured sparsity methods. To retain high accuracy without retraining, we introduce three novel techniques: (i) a lightweight mask search algorithm that finds which heads and filters to prune based on the Fisher information; (ii) mask rearrangement that complements the search algorithm; and (iii) mask tuning that reconstructs the output activations for each layer. We apply our method to BERT-base and DistilBERT, and we evaluate its effectiveness on GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks. Our framework achieves up to 2.0x reduction in FLOPs and 1.56x speedup in inference latency, while maintaining<1% loss in accuracy. Importantly, our framework prunes Transformers in less than 3 minutes on a single GPU, which is over two orders of magnitude faster than existing pruning approaches that retrain the models.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 109  (*Influential: 16*)\n\n#### 6.

Pruning methods have proven to be an effective way of reducing model size, whereas distillation methods are proven for speeding up inference. We introduce a block pruning approach targeting both small and fast models. Our approach extends structured methods by considering blocks of any size and integrates this structure into the movement pruning paradigm for fine-tuning. We find that this approach learns to prune out full components of the underlying model, such as attention heads. Experiments consider classification and generation tasks, yielding among other results a pruned model that is a 2.4x faster, 74% smaller BERT on SQuAD v1, with a 1% drop on F1, competitive both with distilled models in speed and pruned models in size.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 194  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 7. Pruning Deep Neural Networks from a Sparsity Perspective\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparsity Attention*\n\n*Enmao Diao, G. Wang, Jiawei Zhan, Yuhong Yang, Jie Ding, V. Tarokh*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed PQ Index (PQI) is proposed to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and used to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm that is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, deep network pruning has attracted significant attention in order to enable the rapid deployment of AI into small devices with computation and memory constraints. Pruning is often achieved by dropping redundant weights, neurons, or layers of a deep network while attempting to retain a comparable test performance. Many deep pruning algorithms have been proposed with impressive empirical success. However, existing approaches lack a quantifiable measure to estimate the compressibility of a sub-network during each pruning iteration and thus may under-prune or over-prune the model. In this work, we propose PQ Index (PQI) to measure the potential compressibility of deep neural networks and use this to develop a Sparsity-informed Adaptive Pruning (SAP) algorithm. Our extensive experiments corroborate the hypothesis that for a generic pruning procedure, PQI decreases first when a large model is being effectively regularized and then increases when its compressibility reaches a limit that appears to correspond to the beginning of underfitting. Subsequently, PQI decreases again when the model collapse and significant deterioration in the performance of the model start to occur. Additionally, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed adaptive pruning algorithm with proper choice of hyper-parameters is superior to the iterative pruning algorithms such as the lottery ticket-based pruning methods, in terms of both compression efficiency and robustness.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 18  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8. STEP: Learning N: M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparsity Attention*\n\n*Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Chris De Sa, A. Yazdanbakhsh*\n\n**TL;DR:** STEP is proposed, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N: M masks (mask-learning phase).\n\n**Abstract:** Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n### 1 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1.

Self-Attentive Sequential Recommendation\n\n*From Search Query: Density Adaptive Attention*\n\n*Wang-Cheng Kang, Julian McAuley*\n\n**Abstract:** Sequential dynamics are a key feature of many modern recommender systems,\nwhich seek to capture the `context' of users' activities on the basis of\nactions they have performed recently. To capture such patterns, two approaches\nhave proliferated: Markov Chains (MCs) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs).\nMarkov Chains assume that a user's next action can be predicted on the basis of\njust their last (or last few) actions, while RNNs in principle allow for\nlonger-term semantics to be uncovered. Generally speaking, MC-based methods\nperform best in extremely sparse datasets, where model parsimony is critical,\nwhile RNNs perform better in denser datasets where higher model complexity is\naffordable. The goal of our work is to balance these two goals, by proposing a\nself-attention based sequential model (SASRec) that allows us to capture\nlong-term semantics (like an RNN), but, using an attention mechanism, makes its\npredictions based on relatively few actions (like an MC). At each time step,\nSASRec seeks to identify which items are `relevant' from a user's action\nhistory, and use them to predict the next item. Extensive empirical studies\nshow that our method outperforms various state-of-the-art sequential models\n(including MC/CNN/RNN-based approaches) on both sparse and dense datasets.\nMoreover, the model is an order of magnitude more efficient than comparable\nCNN/RNN-based models. Visualizations on attention weights also show how our\nmodel adaptively handles datasets with various density, and uncovers meaningful\npatterns in activity sequences.\n\n**Published:** 2018-08-20\n\n\n\n#### 2. Generative Adversarial Network in Medical Imaging: A Review\n\n*From Search Query: Density Adaptive Attention*\n\n*Paul Babyn, Ekta Walia, Xin Yi*\n\n**Abstract:** Generative adversarial networks have gained a lot of attention in the computer vision community due to their capability of data generation without explicitly modelling the probability density function. The adversarial loss brought by the discriminator provides a clever way of incorporating unlabeled samples into training and imposing higher order consistency. This has proven to be useful in many cases, such as domain adaptation, data augmentation, and image-to-image translation. These properties have attracted researchers in the medical imaging community, and we have seen rapid adoption in many traditional and novel applications, such as image reconstruction, segmentation, detection, classification, and cross-modality synthesis. Based on our observations, this trend will continue and we therefore conducted a review of recent advances in medical imaging using the adversarial training scheme with the hope of benefiting researchers interested in this technique.\n\n**Published:** 2018-09-19\n\n\n\n#### 3. Pruning Filters for Efficient ConvNets\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Pruning Transformers*\n\n*Hanan Samet, Hans Peter Graf, Igor Durdanovic, Hao Li, Asim Kadav*\n\n**Abstract:** The success of CNNs in various applications is accompanied by a significant\nincrease in the computation and parameter storage costs. Recent efforts toward\nreducing these overheads involve pruning and compressing the weights of various\nlayers without hurting original accuracy. However, magnitude-based pruning of\nweights reduces a significant number of parameters from the fully connected\nlayers and may not adequately reduce the computation costs in the convolutional\nlayers due to irregular sparsity in the pruned networks. We present an\nacceleration method for CNNs, where we prune filters from CNNs that are\nidentified as having a small effect on the output accuracy. By removing whole\nfilters in the network together with their connecting feature maps, the\ncomputation costs are reduced significantly. In contrast to pruning weights,\nthis approach does not result in sparse connectivity patterns. Hence, it does\nnot need the support of sparse convolution libraries and can work with existing\nefficient BLAS libraries for dense matrix multiplications. We show that even\nsimple filter pruning techniques can reduce inference costs for VGG-16 by up to\n34% and ResNet-110 by up to 38% on CIFAR10 while regaining close to the\noriginal accuracy by retraining the networks.\n\n**Published:** 2016-08-31\n\n\n\n#### 4. Learning Efficient Convolutional Networks through Network Slimming\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Pruning Transformers*\n\n*Chang-Shui Zhang, Jianguo Li, Zhiqiang Shen, Zhuang Liu, Gao Huang, Shoumeng Yan*\n\n**Abstract:** The deployment of deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in many real\nworld applications is largely hindered by their high computational cost. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel learning scheme for CNNs to simultaneously 1)\nreduce the model size; 2) decrease the run-time memory footprint; and 3) lower\nthe number of computing operations, without compromising accuracy. This is\nachieved by enforcing channel-level sparsity in the network in a simple but\neffective way. Different from many existing approaches, the proposed method\ndirectly applies to modern CNN architectures, introduces minimum overhead to\nthe training process, and requires no special software/hardware accelerators\nfor the resulting models. We call our approach network slimming, which takes\nwide and large networks as input models, but during training insignificant\nchannels are automatically identified and pruned afterwards, yielding thin and\ncompact models with comparable accuracy. We empirically demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach with several state-of-the-art CNN models,\nincluding VGGNet, ResNet and DenseNet, on various image classification\ndatasets. For VGGNet, a multi-pass version of network slimming gives a 20x\nreduction in model size and a 5x reduction in computing operations.\n\n**Conference:** learning-efficient-convolutional-networks-1\n\n**Published:** 2017-08-22\n\n\n\n#### 5. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparsity Attention*\n\n*Seunghoon Hong, Honglak Lee, Moontae Lee, Jinwoo Kim, Seonwoo Min, Sungjun Cho*\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention. Our implementation can be found in https://github.com/sc782/SBM-Transformer .\n\n**Published:** 2022-10-27\n\n\n\n#### 6. A Heterogeneous Information Network based Cross Domain Insurance Recommendation System for Cold Start Users\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparsity Attention*\n\n*Zhen-Yu Wu, Ye Bi, Jing Xiao, Liqiang Song, Mengqiu Yao, Jianming Wang*\n\n**Abstract:** Internet is changing the world, adapting to the trend of internet sales will bring revenue to traditional insurance companies. Online insurance is still in its early stages of development, where cold start problem (prospective customer) is one of the greatest challenges. In traditional e-commerce field, several cross-domain recommendation (CDR) methods have been studied to infer preferences of cold start users based on their preferences in other domains. However, these CDR methods could not be applied to insurance domain directly due to the domain specific properties. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called a Heterogeneous information network based Cross Domain Insurance Recommendation (HCDIR) system for cold start users. Specifically, we first try to learn more effective user and item latent features in both source and target domains. In source domain, we employ gated recurrent unit (GRU) to module user dynamic interests. In target domain, given the complexity of insurance products and the data sparsity problem, we construct an insurance heterogeneous information network (IHIN) based on data from PingAn Jinguanjia, the IHIN connects users, agents, insurance products and insurance product properties together, giving us richer information. Then we employ three-level (relational, node, and semantic) attention aggregations to get user and insurance product representations.

With its ability to process tokens in linear computational complexities, linear attention, in theory, can handle sequences of unlimited length without sacrificing speed, i.e., maintaining a constant training speed for various sequence lengths with a fixed memory consumption. However, due to the issue with cumulative summation (cumsum), current linear attention algorithms cannot demonstrate their theoretical advantage in a causal setting. In this paper, we present Lightning Attention-2, the first linear attention implementation that enables linear attention to realize its theoretical computational benefits. To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intra-block and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

To achieve this, we leverage the thought of tiling, separately handling the intrablock and inter-block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, we utilize the conventional attention computation mechanism for the intra-blocks and apply linear attention kernel tricks for the inter-blocks. A tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. We implement our algorithm in Triton to make it IO-aware and hardware-friendly. Various experiments are conducted on different model sizes and sequence lengths. Lightning Attention-2 retains consistent training and inference speed regardless of input sequence length and is significantly faster than other attention mechanisms.

Introduction\n\nThe Transformer architecture has achieved widespread adoption, particularly in the domain of large language models\n\n[^0]Preliminary work., Copyright 2024 by the author(s). (LLM) (Brown et al., 2020; Touvron et al., 2023a;b; Peng et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2023b) and multi-modal models (Li et al., 2022; 2023a; Liu et al., 2023; Radford et al., 2021; Li et al., 2023b; Lu et al., 2022; Mao et al., 2023; Shen et al., 2023; Zhou et al., 2023; Sun et al., 2023a; Hao et al., 2024). However, its computational complexity grows quadratically with the length of the input sequence, making it challenging to model extremely long sequences. Unlimited sequence length stands out as a noteworthy aspect within the realm of LLM, attracting considerable attention from researchers who seek intelligent solutions. The potential applications of LLM with unlimited sequence length are diverse, encompassing extended conversations in various professional domains and handling a vast number of tokens in multimodal modeling tasks. In response to the quadratic complexity challenge, a promising resolution emerges in the form of linear attention. This method involves the elimination of the softmax operation and capitalizes on the associativity property of matrix products. Consequently, it significantly accelerates both training and inference procedures. To elaborate, linear attention reduces the computational complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Qin et al., 2022b) to compute the attention matrices, where $n$ represents the sequence length. This avenue holds substantial promise for augmenting the efficiency of transformer-style models across a broad spectrum of applications. It is important to note that the notable reduction in complexity from $O\\left(n^{2}\\right)$ to $O(n)$ in linear attention is only theoretical and may not directly translate to a proportional improvement in computational efficiency on hardware in practice. The realization of practical wall-clock speedup faces challenges, primarily stemming from two issues: 1). the dominance of memory access (I/O) on the GPU could impact the overall computation speed of attention. 2). the cumulative summation (cumsum) needed by the linear attention kernel trick prevents it from reaching its theoretical training speed in the causal setting. The first issue has been successfully addressed by Lightning Attention-1 (Qin et al., 2023b). In this paper, we introduce\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ae38c698417dafba3079g-02.jpg?height=521&width=1709&top_left_y=213&top_left_x=182)\n\nFigure 1.

The diagram above provides a comparative illustration of training speed, Token per GPU per Second (TGS) for LLaMA with FlashAttention-2, TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-1 and TransNormerLLM with Lightning Attention-2, implemented across three model sizes: 400M, 1B, and 3B from left to right. It is strikingly evident that Lightning Attention-2 manifests a consistent training speed irrespective of the increasing sequence length. Conversely, the other methods significantly decline training speed as the sequence length expands. Lightning Attention-2 to solve the second issue. The key idea is to leverage the concept of \"divide and conquer\" by separately handling the intra block and inter block components in linear attention calculation. Specifically, for the intra blocks, we maintain the use of conventional attention computation mechanism to compute the product of QKV, while for the inter blocks, we employ the linear attention kernel trick (Katharopoulos et al., 2020b). Tiling techniques are implemented in both forward and backward procedures to fully leverage GPU hardware capabilities. As a result, the Lightning Attention-2 can train LLMs with unlimited sequence length without extra cost ${ }^{1}$, as its computational speed remains constant with increasing sequence length under fixed memory consumption. We performed a comprehensive evaluation of Lightning Attention-2 across a diverse range of sequence lengths to assess its accuracy and compare its computational speed and memory utilization with FlashAttention-2 (Dao, 2023) and Lightning Attention-1. The findings indicate that Lightning Attention-2 exhibits a notable advantage in computational speed, attributed to its innovative intra-inter separation strategy. Additionally, Lightning Attention-2 demonstrates a reduced memory footprint compared to its counterparts without compromising performance. ## 2. Related Work\n\n### 2.1.

Due to the issue with cumulative summation operations (cumsum), previous linear attention implementations cannot achieve their theoretical advantage in a casual setting. However, this issue can be effectively solved by utilizing different attention calculation strategies to compute the different parts of attention. Specifically, we split the attention calculation into intra-blocks and inter-blocks and use conventional attention computation for intra-blocks and linear attention kernel tricks for inter-blocks. This eliminates the need for cumsum in the linear attention calculation. Furthermore, a tiling technique is adopted through both forward and backward procedures to take full advantage of the GPU hardware. To enhance accuracy while preserving efficacy, we introduce TransNormerLLM (TNL), a new architecture that is tailored to our lightning attention. We conduct rigorous testing on standard and self-collected datasets with varying model sizes and sequence lengths. TNL is notably more efficient than other language models. In addition, benchmark results indicate that TNL performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs utilizing conventional transformer structures.

While linear attention and speculative decoding offer potential solutions, their applicability and synergistic potential for enhancing autoregressive LLMs remain uncertain. We conduct the first comprehensive study on the efficacy of existing linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs, integrating them with speculative decoding. We introduce an augmentation technique for linear attention that ensures compatibility with speculative decoding, enabling more efficient training and serving of LLMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies involving seven existing linear attention models and five encoder/decoder-based LLMs consistently validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs. Notably, our approach achieves up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity on the LLaMA model and up to a 2$\\times$ speedup during generation compared to prior linear attention methods.

Comprehensive Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017; Dosovitskiy et al., 2021) have significantly advanced the fields of language and vision, leading to the development of foundation LLMs such as ChatGPT (Brown et al., 2020; OpenAI, 2023b), LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021), etc. To date, various Transformers have emerged to serve distinct needs, broadly categorized into three types: encoder-based, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models like the original Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), Bard (Waisberg et al., 2023), and T5 (Raffel et al., 2020; Roberts et al., 2022) are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks (e.g., translation, speech recognition), where the encoder extracts features and the decoder produces outputs based on these features. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token based on previous ones. All these models leverage Transformer architectures but differ in their specific purposes and structures. Both encoders and decoders are leveraged in multimodal models like MiniGPT (Zhu et al., 2023; Chen et al., 2023b) and DALL-E (Ramesh et al., 2021). Note that the model architectures used in all categories are based on Transformer. The primary difference lies in their purpose: the encoder is designed to extract features, while the decoder focuses on scoring and generating outputs. Our work presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to the encoder/decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention. Transformers' self-attention modules, known for their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have spurred the development of linear attention methods to improve efficiency, especially in encoder-based LLMs for better training and inference. Techniques such as local attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2023a) limit self-attention to neighboring tokens or group attention queries to reduce the computational cost, while kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022; You et al., 2024) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and exchange the computation order. However, only a few linear attention approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs, aiming to reduce RNN-style sequential state updates over a large number of steps (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, like LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning of pre-trained autoregressive LLMs, yet a thorough analysis comparing various linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs remains lacking. This paper uniquely provides a systematic review of existing linear attentions for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention techniques alleviate the training inefficiency in LLMs by mitigating the quadratic complexity with regard to the number of input tokens. However, during deployment, autoregressive decoding necessitates sequential token-by-token text generation, which curtails parallelism and restricts the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving, utilizing small speculative models for initial generation, with original LLMs serving as validators to assess if the output meets standards or needs resampling. Recent works like Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b) further argue that the small speculative models and LLMs can be the same model, and other studies (Schuster et al., 2022; Bae et al., 2023) suggest using shallow layers for generation and deeper layers for verification, based on early exit strategies. Such speculative decoding and linear attention jointly ensure efficient LLM training and generation, especially for long sequence inputs. In this paper, we take the initiative to investigate the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling, to improve the efficiency of training and serving LLMs. ## B. More Visualization of Training Trajectories. As detailed in Sec. 5.3, we present a quantitative analysis comparing local LAs, grouped LAs, and our augmented LAs that combine both local augmentation and grouped LAs. This appendix provides the training trajectories for GPT-2 using these LA methods. Fig. 10 demonstrates that our local augmentation, specifically masked DWConv, effectively enhances both local and grouped LAs. Moreover, our augmented LAs, which integrate local augmentation with grouped LAs, exhibit the most favorable convergence in terms of loss. ## C. More Profiling on the LLaMA-2-7B Model\n\nWe provide detailed profiling and comparisons below to illustrate the runtime distribution between attention and feed-forward networks (FFNs), highlighting that attention is a bottleneck even for LLMs with 7B parameters.

This indicates that although FFNs are a bottleneck in the model, attention is an even more significant bottleneck, especially for large-scale LLMs and extended dialogue sequences (e.g., $67.8 \\%$ runtime latency for the arxiv summarization task). Therefore, optimizing attention blocks can yield considerable speed improvements, particularly for tasks with large prefill or decode sequence lengths. This is corroborated by contemporary studies on linear attention-based LLMs (Lee et al., 2023; Yang et al., 2023) and efforts to optimize attention, such as FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022) and FLAT (Kao et al., 2023).

Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.94)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

However, linear attentions often underperform standard softmax attention in quality. To close this performance gap, we find prior linear attentions lack key properties of softmax attention tied to good performance: low-entropy (or \"spiky\") weights and dot-product monotonicity. We further observe surprisingly simple feature maps that retain these properties and match softmax performance, but are inefficient to compute in linear attention. We thus propose Hedgehog, a learnable linear attention that retains the spiky and monotonic properties of softmax attention while maintaining linear complexity. Hedgehog uses simple trainable MLPs to produce attention weights mimicking softmax attention. Experiments show Hedgehog recovers over $99 \\%$ of standard Transformer quality in train-from-scratch and finetuned-conversion settings, outperforming prior linear attentions up to 6 perplexity points on WikiText-103 with causal GPTs, and up to 8.7 GLUE score points on finetuned bidirectional BERTs. Hedgehog also enables pretrained-conversion. Converting a pretrained GPT-2 into a linear attention variant achieves state-of-the-art 16.7 perplexity on WikiText103 for 125 M subquadratic decoder models. We finally turn a pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model, where prior linear attentions lead to 16.5 point drops. ## 1 Introduction\n\nLinear attentions are promising methods for improving Transformer efficiency. By replacing the softmax of attention's query and key dot products with kernel function feature maps, linear attentions reduce attention's time and space complexity from $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{2} d\\right)$ to $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d d^{\\prime}\\right)$ where $n$ is sequence length, $d$ is head dimension and $d^{\\prime}$ the feature map dimension (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Peng et al., 2021; Xiong et al., 2021; Schlag et al., 2021). For typical Transformer settings, e.g., with head dimension $=64$ and sequence lengths at 512 to 32 K , this quadratic-to-linear scaling can result in significant speed and memory improvements (Fig. 6). As drop-in alternatives to popular softmax attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), linear attentions not only improve Transformer efficiency when training new models from scratch but can also improve inference efficiency by converting pretrained Transformers into corresponding linear variants (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). Linear attention enables efficient Transformers in a variety of regimes:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: training Transformer models with linear attention with the goal of matching standard Transformer performance, e.g., as tested on benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) classification (Tay et al., 2021) and WikiText-103 language modeling (Merity et al., 2017). - Finetuned-conversion: swapping the attentions of task-specific Transformers and finetuning them to convert existing models into linear versions, with the goal to recover original task performance with improved efficiency (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). ![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_ed734f9b01ac86d7959fg-02.jpg?height=467&width=1625&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=239)\n\nFigure 1: Hedgehog learns a trainable linear attention feature map designed to mimic standard attention, resulting in expressive yet efficient linear attentions for various Transformer training settings\n\n- Pretrained-conversion: doing the same as finetuned-conversion but for pretrained Transformers such as large language models (LLMs), e.g., to transfer to new tasks and longer contexts. Unfortunately, existing linear attention mechanisms typically fail to match softmax attention in modeling quality. When training from scratch, linear attentions achieve 4-6 worse perplexity ( ppl ) than softmax attention on standard benchmarks such as WikiText-103 (Schlag et al., 2021; Irie et al., 2021; Fu et al., 2023), the equivalent gap between 125 M and 255 M Transformers (Dai et al., 2019). When converting finetuned models, linear attention models require additional quadratic attention modules to close the gap (Kasai et al., 2021; Mao, 2022). One might worry that such gaps are fundamental; for example, recent theory using the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH) showed that high-quality truly subquadratic algorithms to approximate softmax attention may be impossible with large sequence length $n$ (Alman \\& Song, 2023; Keles et al., 2023). We begin by empirically studying why this performance gap exists between standard softmax and proposed linear attentions. We identify two simple properties for softmax attention which prior linear attentions lack: 1) low-entropy \"spikyness\" and 2) dot-product monotonicity. We hypothesize that the quality gap in linear attentions corresponds with lacking these two properties:\n\n- Low-entropy \"spikyness\": Intuitively, we want attentions that attend to relevant tokens while ignoring irrelevant ones via their query-key interactions. We observe these low-entropy or \"spiky\" attention-weight distributions in standard Transformer attention but not prior linear attention maps-where spikes enabled via the scaled dot-product softmax are lost via other feature maps (Fig. 2) - and find this strongly corresponds to Transformer performance (Fig. 4). - Dot-product monotonicity: This property requires that attention weights increase as the dot products of their corresponding queries and keys increase. Intuitively, the lack of this monotonicity can produce unstable gradients during training and finetuning, where increasing the query-key dot product can result in decreasing the attention weight the other way (and vice versa). As a first step to recover these properties, we explore simple feature maps - such as low-degree Taylor polynomial approximations to the $\\exp ()$ function - that satisfy the above two properties (albeit in restricted regimes of bounded query-key dot products). In practice, we find that queries and keys are often bounded, resulting in linear attentions that recover softmax attention's spikiness, monotonicity, and subsequent performance. Unfortunately, while technically linear in sequence length, these polynomial feature maps remain inefficient to compute. They take $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{p+1}\\right)$ time and space, and we find degree $p \\geq 2$ necessary for performance. We thus propose Hedgehog, an efficient-to-compute learnable linear attention trained to capture the spiky and monotonic softmax properties. Unlike prior works that propose a specific kernel function (Katharopoulos et al., 2020; Choromanski et al., 2020; Qin et al., 2022b) and our polynomial feature maps, we learn these feature maps as single-layer MLPs specifically trained to match softmax attention weights. By mapping from $\\mathbb{R}^{d} \\mapsto \\mathbb{R}^{d}$, we maintain prior linear attentions' $\\mathcal{O}\\left(n d^{2}\\right)$ complexity. However, training these mappings via softmax attention weights as cross-entropy soft-labels, we find Hedgehog can match softmax attention weights with much higher fidelity (Fig. 7), producing low-entropy and monotonic weights that match standard attention performance quality. We validate experimentally that Hedgehog's improved expressivity translates to closing the softmax attention performance gap in the three regimes mentioned above:\n\n- Training-from-scratch: we find Hedgehog matches Transformers on standard attention benchmarks such as Long Range Arena (LRA) (Tay et al., 2021) task, and closes the linear attention gap by $68.6 \\%$ on WikiText-103 language modeling (improving up to 6 ppl ). - Finetuned-conversion: we find Hedgehog recovers $>99 \\%$ of original model performance on average across bidirectional encoder-only 110M BERT-base models finetuned on GLUE and causal decoder-only 125M GPT models finetuned on Wikitext-103. - Pretrained-conversion: we find Hedgehog enables effective transfer to new tasks and efficient scaling to longer contexts, while frequently outperforming modern subquadratic sequence architectures by linearizing existing pretrained Transformers. A 125M Hedgehog-GPT-2 finetuned on Wikitext-103 achieves a new state-of-the-art 16.7 ppl for subquadratic models of the same size. Finally, we demonstrate that Hedgehog can be scaled up to modern large language models; we convert pretrained Llama-2 7B into a viable linear attention Llama. With low-rank adaptation, Hedgehog-Llama2 7B achieves up to 28.1 higher ROUGE-1 points over the base standard attention model. In contrast, prior linear attentions result in models that struggle to produce coherent text (with 16.5 ROUGE-1 point drops). ## 2 Preliminaries and Related Work\n\nWe provide background on attention computation, describe kernel feature based linear attentions, and finally provide details on existing linear attention mechanisms proposed in the literature.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block, specifically the **AdaptiveSparseTTTLinear** proposal, here are the key points and the most useful information that can be leveraged:\n\n### Goal and Intent\nThe researcher aims to enhance the FastTTTLinear model by integrating two main components:\n- **Density-Adaptive Attention:** To dynamically modulate attention weights using learnable density parameters.\n- **Structured Sparsity through Gradient-Based Pruning:** To reduce computational complexity and memory requirements while preserving model performance and test-time training capabilities.\n\n### Key Components and Relevant Information\n\n#### Density-Adaptive Attention\n- **Existing Research:**\n  - The work by Ioannides et al.

Codes and models are available at https://github. com/GATECH-EIC/Linearized-LLM. ## 1. Introduction\n\nLLMs have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in language understanding and generation tasks, sparking immense interest. Autoregressive LLMs, like OpenAI's ChatGPT (OpenAI, 2023a;b), Meta's LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a;b), and Google's Gemini (Anil et al., 2023), have\n\n[^0]achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance in generation. However, these models suffer from significant computational and memory demands, hindering their efficiency in both training and serving. These limitations stem from two key bottlenecks: Bottleneck 1: The attention module, a core component of LLMs, exhibits quadratic complexity relative to the input sequence length. This necessitates training LLMs with limited context sizes (e.g., 2048 tokens for LLaMA), restricting their ability to process lengthy documents or engage in extended conversations (Chen et al., 2023c). Bottleneck 2: The sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during generation, resulting in slow inference speeds, especially for long sequences (Miao et al., 2023). Various techniques have been proposed to address these bottlenecks, including pruning (Ma et al., 2023), quantization (Frantar et al., 2022; Xiao et al., 2023; Harma et al., 2024), speculative decoding (Miao et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023), and linear attention (Qin et al., 2023; Lu et al., 2021). Among these, linear attention tackles Bottleneck 1 by reducing the quadratic complexity of softmax attention from quadratic to linear. Speculative decoding addresses Bottleneck 2 by employing smaller draft models for speculative parallel generation, followed by verification using the full LLM (Miao et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b; Chen et al., 2023a). While promising, the effectiveness of these techniques, especially when combined with autoregressive LLMs, remains largely unexplored. This paper addresses two critical questions: Q1: Can existing linear attention methods, primarily designed for encoder-based LLMs like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) or Vision Transformers (ViTs) (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021), be effectively applied to autoregressive decoder-based LLMs? Q2: Can linear attention and speculative decoding be seamlessly integrated to address both bottlenecks concurrently during LLM training and serving? We conduct the first comprehensive empirical exploration to evaluate the efficacy of linearized autoregressive LLMs and their compatibility with speculative decoding. Our findings for $\\boldsymbol{Q 1}$ reveal that directly applying existing linear attention methods to autoregressive LLMs leads to suboptimal performance, due to the disruption of temporal dependencies cru-\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_1cc36bd06f7697d750b0g-02.jpg?height=278&width=847&top_left_y=216&top_left_x=173)\n\nFigure 1. Empirical evaluation of seven linear attention methods on top of three types of LLMs on the GLUE (Wang et al., 2018) benchmark: (1) encoder-based BERT (Devlin et al., 2018); (2) decoderbased GPT-2 (Radford et al., 2019); and (3) encoder-decoder T5 (Roberts et al., 2022). Left: The majority of SOTA linear attentions, including LinFormer (Wang et al., 2020), TransNormer(Qin et al., 2022), FLASH-Local (Hua et al., 2022), and YOSO (Zeng et al., 2021), exhibit superior performance on encoder-based models compared to decoder-based ones. Right: Other linear attention methods, such as ReLU-based one (Cai et al., 2023a), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2021), and FLASH-Global (Hua et al., 2022), consistently perform less effectively on all LLMs. cial for autoregressive generation. For instance, convolutionbased augmentation techniques (You et al., 2023b; Xiong et al., 2021) introduce \"information leakage\" from future tokens during training, i.e., they use convoluted future context directly instead of predicting the next tokens. Addressing Q2, we find that direct integration of linear attention with speculative decoding is ineffective, owing to mismatches in handling temporal dependencies. In particular, speculative decoding employs \"tree-based\" attention, complicating the application of standard linear attention methods. Motivated by these challenges, we propose an effective local convolutional augmentation to prevent information leakage, boost performance, and maintain compatibility with speculative decoding. Our key contributions are:\n\n- We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of seven linear attention methods across three types of LLMs (encoderbased, decoder-based, and encoder-decoder), revealing that existing encoder-based linear attentions are not optimally suited for autoregressive decoder-based LLMs. - We introduce an effective local augmentation technique that enhances the local feature extraction capabilities of linear attention in autoregressive LLMs while preventing information leakage. - We develop a solution for seamlessly integrating linear attention with speculative decoding's tree-based attention, boosting token-level parallelism for efficient generation and accelerating both LLM training and serving. - Extensive experiments on five LLMs validate the effectiveness of our augmented linearized LLMs, achieving up to a 6.67 reduction in perplexity and up to $2 \\times$ speedups during generation over existing linear attention methods. ## 2. Related Works\n\nAutoregressive LLMs. Existing LLMs are broadly categorized into three architectures: encoder-based, decoderbased, and encoder-decoder models. Encoder-based models like BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) focus on natural language understanding and are also commonly used in image processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021). Encoder-decoder models, such as Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), are designed for sequence-to-sequence tasks, where the encoder extracts features and the decoder generates outputs. Decoder-based models, including GPT (Radford et al., 2019; OpenAI, 2023b) and LLaMA (Touvron et al., 2023a), generate text sequentially by predicting the next token. While all these models utilize Transformer architectures, their specific design and purpose vary. This paper presents a comprehensive study of applying linear attention techniques to both encoder-decoder and decoder-based LLMs. Efficient Linear Attention Self-attention in transformers, with their quadratic computational complexity (Zhu et al., 2021; Katharopoulos et al., 2020), have led to the development of linear attention methods. Kernel-based linear attentions (Liu et al., 2021; Arar et al., 2022; Wang et al., 2020; Tu et al., 2022) decompose the softmax with kernel functions and change the computation order. However, few approaches focus on decoder-based autoregressive LLMs (Hua et al., 2022; Katharopoulos et al., 2020). Recent studies, such as LongLoRA (Chen et al., 2023c), aim to adapt local attention techniques for efficient fine-tuning, but a thorough comparison of linear attention methods for autoregressive LLMs is less explored. This paper systematically review existing linear attention for decoder-based autoregressive LLMs and investigates how to efficiently enhance less effective linear attention methods. Speculative Decoding. Linear attention methods reduce training inefficiencies, but the sequential nature of autoregressive decoding limits parallelism during deployment, restricting the number of input tokens. Speculative decoding (Chen et al., 2023a; Miao et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023; Leviathan et al., 2023; Cai et al., 2023b) has proven to be an effective strategy for boosting parallelism in LLM serving. It utilizes small speculative models for initial generation, with the original LLMs validating the outputs. Recent works, such as Medusa (Cai et al., 2023b), suggests that these models can be the same. This paper investigates the synergy between linearized LLMs and speculative sampling to improve LLM training and serving efficiency.\n```\n\n#### 2.

Despite the inspiring success of their wide applications on both Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) downstream tasks, extending the context window size to long sequences with computation and memory efficiently poses significant challenges $[1,20,19]$, owing to the quadratic computation complexity and large amounts of key/value vectors associated with self-attention, especially on resource-constrained devices. Many recent studies resort to developing learnable sparse and memory-efficient forms of attention to scale to large sequence lengths. However, applying traditional learnable sparse attention methods to long-range Transformer decoders suffers from two major bottlenecks: (i) Previous studies usually overlook the memory cost of fully memorizing Key-Value (KV) pairs. Clustering-based methods $[39,61]$ allow queries to attend to different sets of KV pairs. In such methods, KV embeddings are required to be fully stored in memory to avoid repetitive computation, which leads to huge memory redundancy and inefficiency when it comes to long-range inference [81, 42, 78]. (ii) Previous learnable sparse attention often has super-linear complexity, especially during training. For example, clustering-based methods usually $\\operatorname{cost} O(n \\log n)$ to maintain clusters. Ainslie et al. [1]\n\n[^0]![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_17_81cbe08ae077927ce965g-02.jpg?height=549&width=1261&top_left_y=254&top_left_x=432)\n\nFigure 1: Left: SPARSEK operation in the attention module. KV pairs are scored by u. SPARSEK computes a threshold for each query ( $\\tau(\\mathbf{u})$ ) such that the sum of normalized scores is $k$, which is 3 in this example. We select top- $k$ KV pairs (orange cells) to perform attention. Right: the SPARSEK attention module. We fuse selection and attention in one kernel for efficiency. incorporates a SOFTTOPK operator [41] to compute soft masks in Transformer encoders. Meanwhile, migrating SOFTTOPK to Transformer decoders is less advantageous because solving SofTTOPK for variable-length context associated with different queries requires quadratic time in total. To tackle the aforementioned barriers, we propose SparseK Attention, an innovative technique that achieves both computational and memory efficiency for training and inference-time attention computing in Transformer decoders, as depicted in Figure 1. Within a self-attention module, our method incorporates (1) a scoring network evaluating the importance of each KV pair without accessing the queries that possibly attend to it, and (2) a novel differentiable top- $k$ mask operator SPARSEK, which normalizes scores to a soft mask (or gates) in linear time. It is worth noting that our method draws inspiration from the concept of top- $k$ attention [32, 1]. Unfortunately, conventional top- $k$ attention is non-differentiable and therefore cannot be used to train the scoring network. With thorough comparisons with prior sparse attention learning approaches, we highlight the main advantages of SPARSEK attention as follows. ## Incremental KV Selection. The SPARSEK operator (\u00a7 3.3) supports incremental evaluation and thus has a linear complexity in the decoder. Besides, compared with SOFTTOPK that performs iterative approximation as in CoLT5 [1], our operator computes the exact operation results. Computational and Memory Efficiency. SPARSEK reduces the quadratic training-time complexity of previous learnable sparse attention methods [65,32, 2, 47] to linear time and achieves constant memory cost in inference. This improvement of training-time complexity is achieved by the efficiency of KV selection and applying the same level of sparsity in training as in inference. Additionally, the query-independence of our scoring network guarantees the irreversibility of masking out key-value pairs. This ensures memory efficiency at inference time, allowing for the safe removal of masked key-value pairs from memory immediately (\u00a73.2). Extension with IO-awareness. FlashAttention [20] is a widely adopted optimization for accelerating LLMs with IO-awareness. However, the sparsity learned through our method presents a complex memory access pattern, hindering its direct application. To address this, we develop a Triton kernel that fuses the computation of attention and the selection of proper key-value pairs. Our implementation exhibits linear complexity and surpasses FlashAttention in performance when handling 4096 input tokens, of which 1024 key-value pairs are selected for each query. Additionally, we offer a kernel for the backward pass, which fuses the computation of the gradient of SPARSEK and others, resulting in increased speed and improved memory efficiency. We verify the advantages of SPARSEK attention by replacing full attention in various models (such as GPT2 [57] and Pythia [6]) with it and other efficient attention methods. We consider a wide range of settings, including training from scratch and fine-tuning pretrained models. Experiments\non language modeling and downstream tasks demonstrate that, when matching the context size, our method outperforms other efficient attention methods consistently while providing promising speed-up at training compared to full attention. ## 2 Related Work\n\nLong-range Transformers Self-attention is a cornerstone of Transformer success, but its quadratic complexity concerning input length poses challenges for tasks requiring long context. Numerous efficient approaches have emerged, spanning state-space models [30, 62], recurrent neural networks [45, 52, 49], linear attention [55, 38] and low-rank approximations of self-attention [75, 14, 53], which replace the self-attention with novel linear blocks for long-context modeling. Nonetheless, these approaches historically underperformed compared to modern Transformer models [70] in language modeling tasks until recent efforts [29, 77]. Besides, a few studies combine the Transformer with block-wise recurrence $[17,35,36,12]$ or key-value compression [60, 59, 18]. In contrast, our approach falls under sparse attention, reducing complexity by pruning the attention matrix. This approach is motivated by observations that the attention matrix in dense models naturally becomes sparse, and the performance of language models remains robust under reasonably sparse conditions $[15,27,42]$. Sparse attention Some sparse attention utilized fixed patterns to restrict the number of tokens involved, such as sliding windows [56, 51], dilated sliding windows [4, 22], combination of patterns $[34,13]$, or domain-specific patterns [31]. Recent studies have aimed at achieving constant memory costs during inference through predefined heuristic cache eviction policies [81, 42, 27].\n```\n\n#### 3. Luna: Linear unified nested attention (Avg.

In this paper, we propose Luna, a linear unified nested attention mechanism that approximates softmax attention with two nested linear attention functions, yielding only linear (as opposed to quadratic) time and space complexity. Specifically, with the first attention function, Luna packs the input sequence into a sequence of fixed length. Then, the packed sequence is unpacked using the second attention function. As compared to a more traditional attention mechanism, Luna introduces an additional sequence with a fixed length as input and an additional corresponding output, which allows Luna to perform attention operation linearly, while also storing adequate contextual information. We perform extensive evaluations on three benchmarks of sequence modeling tasks: long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation and masked language modeling for large-scale pretraining. Competitive or even better experimental results demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of Luna compared to a variety\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/28 (Score: 0.78)*\n\n```\nFor a detailed overview we refer the readers to Tay et al. (2020b). Sparse Attention The general idea of these methods is that, instead of attending to the whole sequence, each token only access to a fixed, predefined range such as local neighborhoods and strided or \"dilated\" windows. Popular methods include local attention (Parmar et al., 2018), blockwise attention (Qiu et al., 2019), strided attention patterns (Child et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2020), and compressed attention (Liu et al., 2018). To make this range more flexible, Reformer (Kitaev et al., 2020) employs a hash-based similarity measure to efficiently cluster tokens into chunks and Routing Transformer(Roy et al., 2021) employ online k-means clustering on the tokens. The Sinkhorn sorting Network (Tay et al., 2020a) exposes the sparsity in attention weights by learning to sort blocks of the input sequence. Kernel Methods. A recently popular method to improve the efficiency of Transformers is to avoid explicitly computing the $m \\times n$ attention matrix $A$ in (1) by re-writing it with kernels. Typical models leveraging kernelization are Linear Transformer (Katharopoulos et al., 2020), Performer (Choromanski et al., 2020) and Random Feature Attention (Peng et al., 2021). Since kernels are a form of approximation of the attention matrix, they can be also viewed as a form of low-rank method (Choromanski et al., 2020) that compresses the context to a shorter length, such as Linformer (Wang et al., 2019) and the proposed Luna model. Recurrence. The simplest technique to reduce the complexity of Transformer is to chunk input sequences into fixed blocks, with the obvious disadvantage of losing contextual information from past chunks. As discussed in Tay et al. (2020b), these models can be regarded as fixed pattern models. Transformer-XL (Dai et al., 2019) proposed a natural extension to the blockwise method to connect these blocks via a recurrence mechanism. Compressive Transformer (Rae et al., 2020) further extends Transformer-XL by maintaining a fine-grained memory of past chunk activations, which are discarded in Transformer-XL. Technically, Luna can be adapted to a recurrence method, by simply using $P$ as an inherent memory module to maintain the recurrence across segments. ## 6 Conclusion\n\nWe have introduced Luna, a simple, efficient and effective linear attention mechanism used as a drop-in substitute for regular softmax attention. By introducing an extra input with the fixed length, Luna is capable of capturing adequate contextual information while performing attention operations linearly. On three sequence modeling tasks, i.e., long-context sequence modeling, neural machine translation, and large-scale pretraining and finetuning, Luna achieves comparable or even better performance than a variety of strong baselines, while acquiring prominent gains of efficiency in both speed and memory. In future work, we are interested in combining Luna with recurrence methods where $P$ can be used as a running memory across segments of inputs. Another interesting direction would be to apply Luna to other tasks with long input sequences, such as document-level summarization and translation. ## Acknowledgments and Disclosure of Funding\n\nThis material is based on research sponsored by Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) under agreement number FA8750-19-1-1000.\n```\n\n#### 4. Dynamic Context Pruning for Efficient and Interpretable Autoregressive Transformers (Avg. Score: 0.69)\n\n*Sotiris Anagnostidis, Dario Pavllo, Luca Biggio, Lorenzo Noci, Aur\u00e9lien Lucchi, Thomas Hofmann*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2023)\t**Cited by** 22  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs.\n\n**Abstract:** Autoregressive Transformers adopted in Large Language Models (LLMs) are hard to scale to long sequences. Despite several works trying to reduce their computational cost, most of LLMs still adopt attention layers between all pairs of tokens in the sequence, thus incurring a quadratic cost. In this study, we present a novel approach that dynamically prunes contextual information while preserving the model's expressiveness, resulting in reduced memory and computational requirements during inference. Our method employs a learnable mechanism that determines which uninformative tokens can be dropped from the context at any point across the generation process. By doing so, our approach not only addresses performance concerns but also enhances interpretability, providing valuable insight into the model's decision-making process. Our technique can be applied to existing pre-trained models through a straightforward fine-tuning process, and the pruning strength can be specified by a sparsity parameter. Notably, our empirical findings demonstrate that we can effectively prune up to 80\\% of the context without significant performance degradation on downstream tasks, offering a valuable tool for mitigating inference costs. Our reference implementation achieves up to $2\\times$ increase in inference throughput and even greater memory savings.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 8/30 (Score: 0.69)*\n\n```\nAs context windows become larger by the day in state-of-the-art models, we expect these gains to become even more relevant. Interpretability. Fig. 8 provides insights into the interpretability aspect of the model's decisionmaking process. It is observed that token removal predominantly occurs when encountering stop words (punctuation), which aligns with the intuition that local information within a sentence becomes less relevant after its completion. Furthermore, it is worth noting that layers at varying depths exhibit distinct behaviors, reinforcing our rationale for dissecting token removal decisions across depth. The variance in sparsity distribution across different depths indicates the necessity of conducting additional interpretability research to obtain valuable insights in the interactions of the tokens within the model. We provide more insights towards this direction in the Appendix C. ## 5 Discussion\n\nWe proposed Adaptively Sparse Attention, a novel approach to dynamically prune the context in decoder-only Transformer architectures. Our results indicate that our technique performs favourably compared to competitive baselines in terms of the ratio between perplexity and sparsity of the attention weights. Remarkably our approach also significantly reduces the computational and memory requirements without affecting its final performance. We practically showcase these benefits achieving more than double the throughput at cases. Adaptively sparse attention comes with two additional practical advantages: first, it can be seamlessly integrated into existing pre-trained models via a cheap fine-tuning step; second, it represents an orthogonal contribution to the burgeoning research line aimed at increasing the level of efficiency of modern LLMs. As such, we envision its combination with existing techniques like weight pruning and quantization to be a promising avenue for future research. ## References\n\nLalit R Bahl, Frederick Jelinek, and Robert L Mercer.

Excitingly, these architectures use a constant amount of memory during inference. However, due to the limited memory, recurrent LMs cannot recall and use all the information in long contexts leading to brittle in-context learning (ICL) quality. A key challenge for efficient LMs is selecting what information to store versus discard. In this work, we observe the order in which information is shown to the LM impacts the selection difficulty. To formalize this, we show that the hardness of information recall reduces to the hardness of a problem called set disjointness (SD), a quintessential problem in communication complexity that requires a streaming algorithm (e.g., recurrent model) to decide whether inputted sets are disjoint. We empirically and theoretically show that the recurrent memory required to solve SD changes with set order, i.e., whether the smaller set appears first in-context. Our analysis suggests, to mitigate the reliance on data order, we can put information in the right order in-context or process prompts non-causally. Towards that end, we propose: (1) JRT-Prompt, where context gets repeated multiple times in the prompt, effectively showing the model all data orders. This gives $11.0 \\pm 1.3$ points of improvement, averaged across $16$ recurrent LMs and the $6$ ICL tasks, with $11.9\\times$ higher throughput than FlashAttention-2 for generation prefill (length $32$k, batch size $16$, NVidia H100). We then propose (2) JRT-RNN, which uses non-causal prefix-linear-attention to process prompts and provides $99\\%$ of Transformer quality at $360$M params., $30$B tokens and $96\\%$ at $1.3$B params., $50$B tokens on average across the tasks, with $19.2\\times$ higher throughput for prefill than FA2.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 23/71 (Score: 0.45)*\n\n```\n[64] A.

ReLU-activated neural networks create piecewise linear prediction models. Other nonlinear activation functions lead to models with only high-order feature interactions, thus lacking of interpretability. Recent methods incorporate candidate polynomial terms of fixed orders into deep learning, which is subject to the issue of combinatorial explosion, or learn the orders that are difficult to adapt to different regions of the feature space. We propose a Polyhedron Attention Module (PAM) to create piecewise polynomial models where the input space is split into poly-hedrons which define the different pieces and on each piece the hyperplanes that define the polyhedron boundary multiply to form the interactive terms, resulting in interactions of adaptive order to each piece. PAM is interpretable to identify important interactions in predicting a target. Theoretic analysis shows that PAM has stronger expression capability than ReLU-activated networks. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superior classification performance of PAM on massive datasets of the click-through rate prediction and PAM can learn meaningful interaction effects in a medical problem.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2. Transformers meet Stochastic Block Models: Attention with Data-Adaptive Sparsity and Cost\n\n*From Search Query: Density Adaptive Linear Attention*\n\n*Sungjun Cho, Seonwoo Min, Jinwoo Kim, Moontae Lee, Honglak Lee, Seunghoon Hong*\n\n**TL;DR:** Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation, and theoretically shows that it outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.\n\n**Abstract:** To overcome the quadratic cost of self-attention, recent works have proposed various sparse attention modules, most of which fall under one of two groups: 1) sparse attention under a hand-crafted patterns and 2) full attention followed by a sparse variant of softmax such as $\\alpha$-entmax. Unfortunately, the first group lacks adaptability to data while the second still requires quadratic cost in training. In this work, we propose SBM-Transformer, a model that resolves both problems by endowing each attention head with a mixed-membership Stochastic Block Model (SBM). Then, each attention head data-adaptively samples a bipartite graph, the adjacency of which is used as an attention mask for each input. During backpropagation, a straight-through estimator is used to flow gradients beyond the discrete sampling step and adjust the probabilities of sampled edges based on the predictive loss. The forward and backward cost are thus linear to the number of edges, which each attention head can also choose flexibly based on the input. By assessing the distribution of graphs, we theoretically show that SBM-Transformer is a universal approximator for arbitrary sequence-to-sequence functions in expectation. Empirical evaluations under the LRA and GLUE benchmarks demonstrate that our model outperforms previous efficient variants as well as the original Transformer with full attention.

In this work, we investigate the training dynamics of Transformers by examining the evolution of the attention layers. In particular, we track the attention entropy for each attention head during the course of training, which is a proxy for model sharpness. We identify a common pattern across different architectures and tasks, where low attention entropy is accompanied by high training instability, which can take the form of oscillating loss or divergence. We denote the pathologically low attention entropy, corresponding to highly concentrated attention scores, as $\\textit{entropy collapse}$. As a remedy, we propose $\\sigma$Reparam, a simple and efficient solution where we reparametrize all linear layers with spectral normalization and an additional learned scalar. We demonstrate that $\\sigma$Reparam successfully prevents entropy collapse in the attention layers, promoting more stable training. Additionally, we prove a tight lower bound of the attention entropy, which decreases exponentially fast with the spectral norm of the attention logits, providing additional motivation for our approach. We conduct experiments with $\\sigma$Reparam on image classification, image self-supervised learning, machine translation, speech recognition, and language modeling tasks. We show that $\\sigma$Reparam provides stability and robustness with respect to the choice of hyperparameters, going so far as enabling training (a) a Vision Transformer {to competitive performance} without warmup, weight decay, layer normalization or adaptive optimizers; (b) deep architectures in machine translation and (c) speech recognition to competitive performance without warmup and adaptive optimizers.

How Does Structured Sparsity Work in Abnormal Event Detection\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity Test-Time Training*\n\n*Huamin Ren, Hong Pan, S\u00f8ren Ingvor, T. Moeslund*\n\n**TL;DR:** An algorithm to solve the abnormality detection problem by sparse representation, in which local structured sparsity is preserved in coefficients is proposed and compared with state-of-the-art on the public dataset.\n\n**Abstract:** In traditional sparse modeling, it is assumed that a signal/feature/image can be either accurately or approximately represented by a sparse linear combination of atoms from a learned dictionary. Structured sparsity, which is beyond traditional sparse modeling, addresses collaborative structured sparsity to add stability and prior information to the representation. Specifically, in structured sparse modeling, the atoms are partitioned in groups, and a few groups are selected at a time for the sparse coding. Supposing there are n classes and mi training data for each class i, B[i] = [bi1...bimi ], i = 1...n and each bij \u2208 R , the dictionary of the training data has a block structure where a few blocks of the dictionary correspond to the training data in each class. Thus, a test example can be represented as a linear combination of training data from a few blocks of the dictionary corresponding to its class. Structured sparsity has been found important in computer vision such as face recognition, motion segmentation, and activity recognition, since the data lie in multiple low-dimensional subspaces of a high dimensional ambient space in these applications. In fact, abnormal event detection can be another beneficiary given a testing frame, it should be identified as a normal frame if all the features within the frame preserves a structured sparsity: all features could be linearly represented by only a few atoms, more importantly, these a few atoms come from the same or similar behavior. Otherwise, it should be detected as an abnormal frame. This structured sparsity is illustrated in Fig. 1. It is straightforward to consider structured sparsity algorithms to achieve the structured sparsity shown in Fig. 1. However, it is infeasible to apply structured sparsity algorithms directly in abnormal event detection, which are mainly due to two reasons: 1) abnormal event detection has a highly biased training data only normal videos are used during the training, which is the due to the fact that abnormal videos are limited or even unavailable in advance in most video surveillance applications. As a result, there could be only one label in the training data which hampers supervised learning; 2) Even though there are multiple types of normal behaviors, how many normal patterns lie in the whole surveillance data is still unknown. This is because there is huge amount of video surveillance data and only a small proportion is used in algorithm learning, consequently, the normal patterns in the training data could be incomplete. As a result, any sparse structure learned from the training data could have a high bias and ruin the precision of abnormal event detection. Therefore, we in the paper propose an algorithm to solve the abnormality detection problem by sparse representation, in which local structured sparsity is preserved in coefficients. To better meet the needs of practical video surveillance applications, our method aims at dictionary learning preserving the structured Fig. 1. Ideal structured sparsity in normal and abnormal features. As normal features, their non zeros in coefficients should only distributed in the atoms with the same behavior; as abnormal features, their non zeros in coefficients should spread over atoms. sparsity through a relatively small training data. Our method contains three steps. Step 1: Initial dictionary construction, which selects initial atoms to form multiple dictionaries. These atoms are learned based on visual features; Step 2: Transferring atoms in Step 1 into feature space, and replace atoms in the initial dictionary with new feature atoms; Step 3: Dictionary refinement, which preserves local structured sparsity. We compare our method with state-of-the-art on the public dataset: UCSD anomaly dataset; moreover, we carry our experiments on the Anomaly Stairs dataset with a challenging setting: an incomplete normal patterns or a small set is used for training the model. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our method.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2015\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. STEP: Learning N: M Structured Sparsity Masks from Scratch with Precondition\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity Test-Time Training*\n\n*Yucheng Lu, Shivani Agrawal, Suvinay Subramanian, Oleg Rybakov, Chris De Sa, A. Yazdanbakhsh*\n\n**TL;DR:** STEP is proposed, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N: M masks (mask-learning phase).\n\n**Abstract:** Recent innovations on hardware (e.g. Nvidia A100) have motivated learning N:M structured sparsity masks from scratch for fast model inference. However, state-of-the-art learning recipes in this regime (e.g. SR-STE) are proposed for non-adaptive optimizers like momentum SGD, while incurring non-trivial accuracy drop for Adam-trained models like attention-based LLMs. In this paper, we first demonstrate such gap origins from poorly estimated second moment (i.e. variance) in Adam states given by the masked weights. We conjecture that learning N:M masks with Adam should take the critical regime of variance estimation into account. In light of this, we propose STEP, an Adam-aware recipe that learns N:M masks with two phases: first, STEP calculates a reliable variance estimate (precondition phase) and subsequently, the variance remains fixed and is used as a precondition to learn N:M masks (mask-learning phase). STEP automatically identifies the switching point of two phases by dynamically sampling variance changes over the training trajectory and testing the sample concentration. Empirically, we evaluate STEP and other baselines such as ASP and SR-STE on multiple tasks including CIFAR classification, machine translation and LLM fine-tuning (BERT-Base, GPT-2). We show STEP mitigates the accuracy drop of baseline recipes and is robust to aggressive structured sparsity ratios.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 6. Leveraging Proxy of Training Data for Test-Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity Test-Time Training*\n\n*Juwon Kang, Nayeong Kim, Donghyeon Kwon, Jungseul Ok, Suha Kwak*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them, which enables virtually supervised test-time training and outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Abstract:** We consider test-time adaptation (TTA), the task of adapting a trained model to an arbitrary test domain using unlabeled input data on-the-fly during testing. A common practice of TTA is to disre-gard data used in training due to large memory demand and privacy leakage. However, the training data are the only source of supervision. This motivates us to investigate a proper way of using them while minimizing the side effects. To this end, we propose two lightweight yet informative proxies of the training data and a TTA method fully exploiting them. One of the proxies is composed of a small number of images synthesized (hence, less privacy-sensitive) by data condensation which minimizes their domain-specificity to capture a general underlying structure over a wide spectrum of domains. Then, in TTA, they are translated into labeled test data by stylizing them to match styles of unlabeled test samples. This enables virtually supervised test-time training. The other proxy is inter-class relations of training data, which are transferred to target model during TTA. On four public benchmarks, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones at remarkably less computation and memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 7. SEA: Sparse Linear Attention with Estimated Attention Mask\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparse Linear Attention*\n\n*Heejun Lee, Jina Kim, Jeffrey Willette, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**TL;DR:** SEA is proposed: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask, which estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation.\n\n**Abstract:** The transformer architecture has driven breakthroughs in recent years on tasks which require modeling pairwise relationships between sequential elements, as is the case in natural language understanding. However, long seqeuences pose a problem due to the quadratic complexity of the attention operation. Previous research has aimed to lower the complexity by sparsifying or linearly approximating the attention matrix. Yet, these approaches cannot straightforwardly distill knowledge from a teacher's attention matrix and often require complete retraining from scratch. Furthermore, previous sparse and linear approaches lose interpretability if they cannot produce full attention matrices. To address these challenges, we propose SEA: Sparse linear attention with an Estimated Attention mask. SEA estimates the attention matrix with linear complexity via kernel-based linear attention, then subsequently creates a sparse attention matrix with a top-k selection to perform a sparse attention operation. For language modeling tasks (Wikitext2), previous linear and sparse attention methods show roughly two-fold worse perplexity scores over the quadratic OPT-1.3B baseline, while SEA achieves better perplexity than OPT-1.3B, using roughly half the memory of OPT-1.3B, providing interpretable attention matrix. We believe that our work will have a large practical impact, as it opens the possibility of running large transformers on resource-limited devices with less memory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 8.

Vectorization of the density matrix and quantum simulation of the von Neumann equation of time-dependent Hamiltonians\n\n*From Search Query: Density Adaptive Linear Attention*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** Based oh the properties of Lie algebras, in this work we develop a general framework to linearize the von-Neumann equation rendering it in a suitable form for quantum simulations. We show that one of these linearizations of the von-Neumann equation corresponds to the standard case in which the state vector becomes the column stacked elements of the density matrix and the Hamiltonian superoperator takes the form $I\\otimes H-H^\\top \\otimes I$ where $I$ is the identity matrix and $H$ is the standard Hamiltonian. It is proven that this particular form belongs to a wider class of ways of linearizing the von Neumann equation that can be categorized by the algebra from which they originated. Particular attention is payed to Hermitian algebras that yield real density matrix coefficients substantially simplifying the quantum tomography of the state vector. Based on this ideas, a quantum algorithm to simulate the dynamics of the density matrix is proposed. It is shown that this method, along with the unique properties of the algebra formed by Pauli strings allows to avoid the use of Trotterization hence considerably reducing the circuit depth. Even though we have used the special case of the algebra formed by the Pauli strings, the algorithm can be readily adapted to other algebras. The algorithm is demonstrated for two toy Hamiltonians using the IBM noisy quantum circuit simulator.\n\n**Published:** 2023-06-14\n\n\n\n#### 3. Decomposing the Neurons: Activation Sparsity via Mixture of Experts for Continual Test Time Adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity Test-Time Training*\n\n*Shanghang Zhang, Yanbing Jiang, Yuan Du, Li Du, ran Xu, Jiaming Liu, Huanrui Yang, Gaole Dai, Yulin Luo, Aosong Cheng, Rongyu Zhang*\n\n**Abstract:** Continual Test-Time Adaptation (CTTA), which aims to adapt the pre-trained model to ever-evolving target domains, emerges as an important task for vision models. As current vision models appear to be heavily biased towards texture, continuously adapting the model from one domain distribution to another can result in serious catastrophic forgetting. Drawing inspiration from the human visual system's adeptness at processing both shape and texture according to the famous Trichromatic Theory, we explore the integration of a Mixture-of-Activation-Sparsity-Experts (MoASE) as an adapter for the CTTA task. Given the distinct reaction of neurons with low/high activation to domain-specific/agnostic features, MoASE decomposes the neural activation into high-activation and low-activation components with a non-differentiable Spatial Differentiate Dropout (SDD). Based on the decomposition, we devise a multi-gate structure comprising a Domain-Aware Gate (DAG) that utilizes domain information to adaptive combine experts that process the post-SDD sparse activations of different strengths, and the Activation Sparsity Gate (ASG) that adaptively assigned feature selection threshold of the SDD for different experts for more precise feature decomposition. Finally, we introduce a Homeostatic-Proximal (HP) loss to bypass the error accumulation problem when continuously adapting the model. Extensive experiments on four prominent benchmarks substantiate that our methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance in both classification and segmentation CTTA tasks. Our code is now available at https://github.com/RoyZry98/MoASE-Pytorch.\n\n**Published:** 2024-05-26\n\n\n\n#### 4. PD-Sparse : A Primal and Dual Sparse Approach to Extreme Multiclass and Multilabel Classification\n\n*From Search Query: Structured Sparsity Test-Time Training*\n\n*Inderjit S. Dhillon, Ian En-Hsu Yen, Pradeep Ravikumar, Kai Zhong, Xiangru Huang*\n\n**Abstract:** We consider Multiclass and Multilabel classification with extremely large number of classes, of which only few are labeled to each instance. In such setting, standard methods that have training, prediction cost linear to the number of classes become intractable. State-of-the-art methods thus aim to reduce the complexity by exploiting correlation between labels under assumption that the similarity between labels can be captured by structures such as low-rank matrix or balanced tree. However, as the diversity of labels increases in the feature space, structural assumption can be easily violated, which leads to degrade in the testing performance. In this work, we show that a margin-maximizing loss with l1 penalty, in case of Extreme Classification, yields extremely sparse solution both in primal and in dual without sacrificing the expressive power of predictor. We thus propose a Fully-Corrective Block-Coordinate Frank-Wolfe (FC-BCFW) algorithm that exploits both primal and dual sparsity to achieve a complexity sublinear to the number of primal and dual variables. A bi-stochastic search method is proposed to further improve the efficiency. In our experiments on both Multiclass and Multilabel problems, the proposed method achieves significant higher accuracy than existing approaches of Extreme Classification with very competitive training and prediction time.\n\n**Proceeding:** icml-2016-6\n\n**Published:** 2016-06-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network for Depth Completion\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparse Linear Attention*\n\n*Hua Yang, Wending Zhou, Qi Zhong, Tao Cheng, Yuankai Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Image-guided depth completion aims to generate dense depth maps with sparse depth measurements and corresponding RGB images. Currently, spatial propagation networks (SPNs) are the most popular affinity-based methods in depth completion, but they still suffer from the representation limitation of the fixed affinity and the over smoothing during iterations. Our solution is to estimate independent affinity matrices in each SPN iteration, but it is over-parameterized and heavy calculation. This paper introduces an efficient model that learns the affinity among neighboring pixels with an attention-based, dynamic approach. Specifically, the Dynamic Spatial Propagation Network (DySPN) we proposed makes use of a non-linear propagation model (NLPM). It decouples the neighborhood into parts regarding to different distances and recursively generates independent attention maps to refine these parts into adaptive affinity matrices. Furthermore, we adopt a diffusion suppression (DS) operation so that the model converges at an early stage to prevent over-smoothing of dense depth. Finally, in order to decrease the computational cost required, we also introduce three variations that reduce the amount of neighbors and attentions needed while still retaining similar accuracy. In practice, our method requires less iteration to match the performance of other SPNs and yields better results overall. DySPN outperforms other state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods on KITTI Depth Completion (DC) evaluation by the time of submission and is able to yield SoTA performance in NYU Depth v2 dataset as well.\n\n**Published:** 2022-02-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. RetrievalAttention: Accelerating Long-Context LLM Inference via Vector Retrieval\n\n*From Search Query: Adaptive Sparse Linear Attention*\n\n*Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Fan Yang, Chen Chen, Kai Zhang, Bailu Ding, Chengruidong Zhang, Qi Chen, Qianxi Zhang, Zhenhua Han, Huiqiang Jiang, Baotong Lu, Meng Chen, Di Liu*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer-based Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly important. However, due to the quadratic time complexity of attention computation, scaling LLMs to longer contexts incurs extremely slow inference latency and high GPU memory consumption for caching key-value (KV) vectors. This paper proposes RetrievalAttention, a training-free approach to both accelerate attention computation and reduce GPU memory consumption. By leveraging the dynamic sparsity of attention mechanism, RetrievalAttention proposes to use approximate nearest neighbor search (ANNS) indexes for KV vectors in CPU memory and retrieves the most relevant ones with vector search during generation. Unfortunately, we observe that the off-the-shelf ANNS indexes are often ineffective for such retrieval tasks due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) between query vectors and key vectors in attention mechanism. RetrievalAttention addresses the OOD challenge by designing an attention-aware vector search algorithm that can adapt to the distribution of query vectors. Our evaluation shows that RetrievalAttention only needs to access 1--3% of data while maintaining high model accuracy. This leads to significant reduction in the inference cost of long-context LLMs with much lower GPU memory footprint. In particular, RetrievalAttention only needs a single NVIDIA RTX4090 (24GB) for serving 128K tokens in LLMs with 8B parameters, which is capable of generating one token in 0.188 seconds.\n\n**Published:** 2024-09-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To help the researcher achieve the goal of designing a novel autoregressive language model (LM) block that integrates density-adaptive attention and structured sparsity, several key areas need to be explored in depth.
