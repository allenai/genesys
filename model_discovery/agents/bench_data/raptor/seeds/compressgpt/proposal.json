Introduction\n\nTransformer models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a range of natural language processing tasks (Vaswani et al., 2017), such as language modeling (De-\n\n[^0]vlin et al., 2019), visual signal processing (Dosovitskiy et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2022; Li et al., 2023; Liu et al., 2023), and speech understanding (Gulati et al., 2020). These models use the attention mechanism, which calculates a dependency score for each pair of tokens in an input sequence. Consequently, full attention has a quadratic time and space complexity relative to the sequence length. This complexity, however, becomes computationally prohibitive for tasks that involve long sequences (Lin et al., 2022). It is worth mentioning that Transformer models equipped with full attention tend to overfit. This is because the attention mechanism does not make any assumptions about the structure of the inputs, which leads to the absence of structural biases. To train a Transformer model, even the order information has to be included. Therefore, the full attention is too flexible to overfit to noise. This limitation restricts the practicality of these models in long sequence modeling, where the dependency signal is often weak and the signal-to-noise ratio is low. To solve this, recent studies have designed hybrid models (Ma et al., 2022; Zuo et al., 2023) by combining efficient state space models (SSMs) (Gu et al., 2021; 2020a; 2022; Hasani et al., 2022; Smith et al., 2023), with expressive attention variants for modeling long sequences from perspectives in structured and flexible patterns, achieving promising results.\n```\n\n#### 2. Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Albert Gu, Tri Dao*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 662  (*Influential: 204*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work identifies that a key weakness of subquadratic-time models based on Transformer architecture is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and integrates selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba).\n\n**Abstract:** Foundation models, now powering most of the exciting applications in deep learning, are almost universally based on the Transformer architecture and its core attention module. Many subquadratic-time architectures such as linear attention, gated convolution and recurrent models, and structured state space models (SSMs) have been developed to address Transformers' computational inefficiency on long sequences, but they have not performed as well as attention on important modalities such as language. We identify that a key weakness of such models is their inability to perform content-based reasoning, and make several improvements. First, simply letting the SSM parameters be functions of the input addresses their weakness with discrete modalities, allowing the model to selectively propagate or forget information along the sequence length dimension depending on the current token. Second, even though this change prevents the use of efficient convolutions, we design a hardware-aware parallel algorithm in recurrent mode. We integrate these selective SSMs into a simplified end-to-end neural network architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Mamba). Mamba enjoys fast inference (5$\\times$ higher throughput than Transformers) and linear scaling in sequence length, and its performance improves on real data up to million-length sequences. As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/74 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\nLi et al. 2023; Orvieto et al. 2023; Poli et al. 2023), and clarify nuances when necessary. SSM Architectures. SSMs are standalone sequence transformations that can be incorporated into end-to-end neural network architectures. (We also sometimes call SSM architectures SSNNs, which are to SSM layers as CNNs are to linear convolution layers.) We discuss some of the most well-known SSM architectures, many of which will also serve as our primary baselines. - Linear attention (Katharopoulos et al. 2020) is an approximation of self-attention involving a recurrence which can be viewed as a degenerate linear SSM. - H3 (Dao, Fu, Saab, et al. 2023) generalized this recurrence to use S4; it can be viewed as an architecture with an SSM sandwiched by two gated connections (Figure 3). H3 also inserts a standard local convolution, which they frame as a shift-SSM, before the main SSM layer. - Hyena (Poli et al. 2023) uses the same architecture as H3 but replaces the S4 layer with an MLP-parameterized global convolution (Romero et al. 2021). - RetNet (Y. Sun et al. 2023) adds an additional gate to the architecture and uses a simpler SSM, allowing an alternative parallelizable computation path, using a variant of multi-head attention (MHA) instead of convolutions. - RWKV (B. Peng et al. 2023) is a recent RNN designed for language modeling based on another linear attention approximation, the attention-free Transformer (S. Zhai et al. 2021). Its main \"WKV\" mechanism involves LTI recurrences and can be viewed as the ratio of two SSMs. Other closely related SSMs and architectures are discussed further in an extended related work (Appendix B). We highlight in particular S5 (Smith, Warrington, and Linderman 2023), QRNN (Bradbury et al. 2016), and SRU (Lei et al. 2017), which we view as the most closely related methods to our core selective SSM. ## 3 Selective State Space Models\n\nWe motivate our selection mechanism using intuition from synthetic tasks (Section 3.1), then explain how to incorporate this mechanism into state space models (Section 3.2). The resulting time-varying SSMs cannot use convolutions, presenting a technical challenge of how to compute them efficiently. We overcome this with a hardware-aware algorithm that exploits the memory hierarchy on modern hardware (Section 3.3). We then describe a simple SSM architecture without attention or even MLP blocks (Section 3.4). Finally, we discuss some additional properties of selection mechanisms (Section 3.5). ### 3.1 Motivation: Selection as a Means of Compression\n\nWe argue that a fundamental problem of sequence modeling is compressing context into a smaller state. In fact, we can view the tradeoffs of popular sequence models from this point of view. For example, attention is both effective and inefficient because it explicitly does not compress context at all. This can be seen from the fact that autoregressive inference requires explicitly storing the entire context (i.e. the KV cache), which directly causes the slow linear-time inference and quadratic-time training of Transformers. On the other hand, recurrent models are efficient because they have a finite state, implying constant-time inference and linear-time training.\n```\n\n#### 3. DenseMamba: State Space Models with Dense Hidden Connection for Efficient Large Language Models (Avg.

While state space model (SSM) is a new type of foundational network architecture offering lower computational complexity, their performance has yet to fully rival that of Transformers. This paper introduces DenseSSM, a novel approach to enhance the flow of hidden information between layers in SSMs. By selectively integrating shallowlayer hidden states into deeper layers, DenseSSM retains fine-grained information crucial for the final output. Dense connections enhanced DenseSSM still maintains the training parallelizability and inference efficiency. The proposed method can be widely applicable to various SSM types like RetNet and Mamba. With similar model size, DenseSSM achieves significant improvements, exemplified by DenseRetNet outperforming the original RetNet with up to 5% accuracy improvement on public benchmarks. code is avalaible at https://github.com/WailordHe/DenseSSM\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/21 (Score: 0.98)*\n\n```\n## 2. Related Works\n\n### 2.1. Large Language Models\n\nLarge language models (LLMs) have seen transformative advancements, enabling them to excel in a diverse array of natural language processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, text summarization, and emergent abilities like incontext learning, which were previously unattainable by earlier language models (Devlin et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2023). The evolution of LLMs has been marked by a monumental shift in scale, exemplified by models like GPT3 (Brown et al., 2020), with its 175 billion parameters, and the even more expansive PaLM (Chowdhery et al., 2022), packing in a astounding 540 billion parameters. These models have empirically validated the scaling law (Kaplan et al., 2020), which posits that increasing model size leads to improved performance. The rapid expansion in model size has underscored the critical need for the development of efficient Transformer algorithms, where FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023) has emerged as a significant innovation. This approach enhances the pivotal attention mechanism within Transformers by optimizing softmax computations using a technique known as tiling. By minimizing memory transactions between the GPU's HBM and on-chip SRAM, FlashAttention compute exact attention with fewer memory accesses, result- ing in both faster execution and a lower memory footprint compared to standard attention implementations. ### 2.2. State Space Models\n\nWhile the Transformer is currently the de facto architecture for large language models (LLMs), providing efficient parallel GPU training, the inference time for single-token inference increases significantly with longer sequence lengths, posing challenges for deployment due to the $\\mathrm{O}(\\mathrm{N})$ complexity per step even with accelerating algorithms like FlashAttention (Dao et al., 2022; Dao, 2023). Efforts have been dedicated to researching the Transformer-Next architecture, aiming to achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with efficient parallel training and effective inference, particularly for long sequence lengths. State Space Sequence Models (SSMs) have recently emerged as promising architectures for sequence modeling. HiPPO (Gu et al., 2020) streamlines sequence modeling by compressing lengthy inputs into a dynamic, polynomialbased representation using orthogonal polynomials. S4 (Gu et al., 2021) introduced a novel parameterization through the application of a low-rank structured correction, enabling stable diagonalization and simplifying the process into Cauchy kernel operations. S5 (Smith et al., 2023) further simplifies the S 4 layer by employing a single multi-input, multi-output SSM and introducing efficient parallel scan algorithms into the S4 layers. H3 (Fu et al., 2023) narrows the performance gap between SSMs and Transformer language models by designing three projections $(\\mathrm{Q}, \\mathrm{K}, \\mathrm{V})$ to simulate the attention mechanism and adopting a fast Fourier transform (FFT) to reduce computation and memory consumption further. GSS (Mehta et al., 2022) was the first gated neural network architecture incorporating SSMs, it builds upon (Hua et al., 2022) and introducing a compact SSM architecture that contracts model dimensions. Unlike GSS, which emphasizes compressing context into a smaller state, Mamba (Gu \\& Dao, 2023) diverges by focusing on enhancing the selectivity of the state representation, aiming to balance the tradeoff between efficiency and effectiveness without compromising the model's ability to capture essential information from the context.\n```\n\n#### 4.

In recent years, the attention mechanism [Vaswani et al. 2017] has been the dominating token-mixing strategy in foundation models. However, its major computational bottleneck, i.e., the quadratic complexity with context length, has posed a challenge to scaling and deploying these models beyond moderate context lengths [Tay et al. 2021]. In order to mitigate these issues, attention-free architectures have been proposed: prominent examples of these are the novel State Space Models (SSMs) Gu et al., 2022b, Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023, Gu and Dao, 2023, Dao and Gu, 2024, as well as recent\n\n[^0]efforts to enhance Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Stani\u0107 et al., 2023, De et al., 2024, Qin et al., 2024, Beck et al., 2024]. Although these models show great promise in boosting efficiency, current comparisons with attention are merely empirical. Despite the prevalence and ubiquity of foundation models, a principled understanding of the similarities and differences among these different design strategies is currently lacking. In order to close this gap, we introduce the Dynamical Systems Framework (DSF), a theoretical framework that allows to evaluate the similarities and differences between different foundation models in a principled manner. This framework spans most current architectures and allows for direct comparisons, theoretical and computational, across attention, SSMs, and RNNs. The DSF provides new insights on the most relevant features found in current architectures, and can inform a systematic development of future hybrid models. Specifically, in this paper we answer the following questions:\n\n## - How are attention, SSMs, and RNNs related? $T L ; D R$ : All three model classes can be represented as recurrent models that can directly be compared using the proposed DSF. - Can softmax attention be expressed as a recurrent model? $T L ; D R$ : Softmax attention translates to a recurrent model within the DSF, however the hidden state dimension needs to be infinite. - Why does state expansion help to improve performance of RNNs and SSMs? $T L ; D R$ : This is related to the second question: state expansion increases the dimension of the hidden state thus allowing for an increased expressivity of the model (Lemma 2). - How closely are linear attention and S6 (i.e. Mamba) related? $T L ; D R$ : The common feature is the coupling of state transition and input matrix via a single (normalization) parameter in recurrent representation. However, the two models differ in the parameterization of this parameter, which we analyze experimentally. - What do selective SSMs teach us about improving RNN architectures? $T L ; D R$ : Replacing the state transition in a RNN variant - qLSTM - with the state transition of S6 improves performance of the RNN. Furthermore, it is important to highlight that, for the models studied here, some model classes are natively stated in recurrent form (i.e. SSMs, RNNs), while others are stated in convolutional (matrix) form (i.e. attention). The DSF allows to switch between these model classes and leverage computational tools developed for other classes. For instance, the recurrent form is efficiently implemented via scan algorithms [Blelloch, 1990], e.g., selective scan [Gu and Dao, 2023], parallel scan [Smith et al., 2023, Orvieto et al., 2023], and accelerated scan [Kyrylov, 2024]. The same holds for the convolutional form via, e.g., flash attention [Dao, 2023], flash linear attention [Yang and Zhang, 2024], and structured masked attention [Dao and Gu, 2024]. Given that the structural requirements on the model parameterization of the algorithm is met, the DSF allows to identify existing algorithms to apply to a new model even if the algorithm was designed for another model class. Notation: We use Latin letters in the following way: $N$ is the size of the hidden state in the DSF, $n$ the state expansion, $d$ the embedding size or model size, and $L$ the sequence length.\n```\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 3/29 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\nWe use superscripts, e.g. . ${ }^{d}$, to denote the elements or block-elements of a matrix and a block-matrix. We use subscripts, e.g. ${ }_{i}$, to denote the time index (or input dependency). Specifically, $v_{i}$ represents the value of vector $v$ at time $i$. We use bold notation to indicate sequences, i.e., $\\mathbf{v}_{i}=\\left[v_{1}, \\ldots, v_{i}\\right]$. We use $\\sigma(\\cdot)$ to denote is the sigmoid function. The products $\\odot$ and $\\otimes$ denote the Hadamard (element-wise) product and the Kronecker (block-wise) product, respectively. $\\mathbb{I}_{n}$ denotes the identity matrix of size $\\mathbb{R}^{n \\times n}$. Generally, we omit stating the bias term for weight matrices unless stating the bias term helps with clarity. ## 2 Preliminaries\n\nIn this section, we introduce the key architectural components studied in this work: attention, SSMs, and RNNs. We remark that these components are often the central block - considered to be the backbone - within a complex architecture composed of other blocks and skip connections (see for instance Touvron et al., 2023]). In what follows, we review exclusively the backbone block, which\nwe denote as $f(\\cdot)$ in $\\mathbf{y}=f(\\mathbf{u})$, where $\\mathbf{u} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ and $\\mathbf{y} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{L \\times d}$ are the input and output sequences, respectively. ### 2.1 Attention\n\nThe standard self-attention block [Vaswani et al. 2017] consists of three matrices: $W_{Q}, W_{K}$, and $W_{V}$, which are the learnt parameters of the model. These matrices, when multiplied with the input $\\mathbf{u}$, yield the queries $\\mathbf{q} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}$, keys $\\mathbf{k} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{k}}$, and values $\\mathbf{v} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_{v}}$, respectively:\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{q}=\\mathbf{u} W_{Q}, \\quad \\mathbf{k}=\\mathbf{u} W_{K}, \\quad \\mathbf{v}=\\mathbf{u} W_{V}\n$$\n\nKeys, queries, and values are then combined in the attention block to produce the output\n\n$$\n\\mathbf{y}=\\zeta\\left(\\frac{\\mathbf{q} \\mathbf{k}^{\\top}}{\\sqrt{d_{k}}}\\right) \\mathbf{v}\n$$\n\nwhere $\\zeta(\\cdot)$ is a map $\\mathbb{R}^{L} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}^{L}$ and is applied row-wise. In the standard version of attention - softmax attention $-\\zeta(\\cdot):=\\operatorname{softmax}(\\cdot)$. However, given the limitations of the softmax function, alternative formulations have been proposed. In this work, we consider two formulations of attention: softmax attention (2) and linear attention [Katharopoulos et al. 2020]. We focus on the masked attention formulations, i.e., the attention matrix $\\zeta\\left(\\mathbf{q k}^{\\top}\\right)$ has a lower-triangular structure. Furthermore, in order to simplify the derivations, we drop the scaling factor $\\sqrt{d_{k}}$. ### 2.2 State Space Models\n\nArchitectures based on a state space parametrization compute the output y through a dynamic recurrence of input signals at each time step $i$,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nh_{i} & =A_{i} h_{i-1}+B_{i} u_{i} \\\\\ny_{i} & =C_{i} h_{i}+D_{i} u_{i}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nwhere $h_{i}$ is the hidden state of the system, and the dynamic matrices of appropriate dimensions $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$ are the learnt parameters of the model. Different time-varying and time-invariant parameterizations for $A_{i}, B_{i}, C_{i}, D_{i}$ have been proposed in the literature (an overview is given in (Amo Alonso et al., 2024]).\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 8 related papers from 2 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: hybrid architecture state space attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1.

However, in more comprehensive tasks like language modeling and machine translation, self-attention-based models still outperform SSMs. Hybrid models employing both SSM and self-attention generally show promising performance, but current approaches apply attention modules statically and uniformly to all elements in the input sequences, leading to sub-optimal quality-efficiency trade-offs. In this work, we introduce Sparse Modular Activation (SMA), a general mechanism enabling neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements in a differentiable manner. Through allowing each element to skip non-activated sub-modules, SMA reduces computation and memory consumption at both training and inference stages of sequence modeling. As a specific instantiation of SMA, we design a novel neural architecture, SeqBoat, which employs SMA to sparsely activate a Gated Attention Unit (GAU) based on the state representations learned from an SSM. By constraining the GAU to only conduct local attention on the activated inputs, SeqBoat can achieve linear inference complexity with theoretically infinite attention span, and provide substantially better quality-efficiency trade-off than the chunking-based models. With experiments on a wide range of tasks, including language modeling, speech classification and long-range arena, SeqBoat brings new state-of-the-art results among hybrid models with linear complexity and reveals the amount of attention needed for each task through the learned sparse activation patterns.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 2.

In this paper, we make progress on understanding the expressivity gap between SSMs and attention in language modeling, and on reducing the hardware barrier between SSMs and attention. First, we use synthetic language modeling tasks to understand the gap between SSMs and attention. We find that existing SSMs struggle with two capabilities: recalling earlier tokens in the sequence and comparing tokens across the sequence. To understand the impact on language modeling, we propose a new SSM layer, H3, that is explicitly designed for these abilities. H3 matches attention on the synthetic languages and comes within 0.4 PPL of Transformers on OpenWebText. Furthermore, a hybrid 125M-parameter H3-attention model that retains two attention layers surprisingly outperforms Transformers on OpenWebText by 1.0 PPL. Next, to improve the efficiency of training SSMs on modern hardware, we propose FlashConv. FlashConv uses a fused block FFT algorithm to improve efficiency on sequences up to 8K, and introduces a novel state passing algorithm that exploits the recurrent properties of SSMs to scale to longer sequences. FlashConv yields 2$\\times$ speedup on the long-range arena benchmark and allows hybrid language models to generate text 2.4$\\times$ faster than Transformers. Using FlashConv, we scale hybrid H3-attention language models up to 2.7B parameters on the Pile and find promising initial results, achieving lower perplexity than Transformers and outperforming Transformers in zero- and few-shot learning on a majority of tasks in the SuperGLUE benchmark.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 268  (*Influential: 21*)\n\n#### 3. Transformers are SSMs: Generalized Models and Efficient Algorithms Through Structured State Space Duality\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu*\n\n**TL;DR:** The state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** While Transformers have been the main architecture behind deep learning's success in language modeling, state-space models (SSMs) such as Mamba have recently been shown to match or outperform Transformers at small to medium scale. We show that these families of models are actually quite closely related, and develop a rich framework of theoretical connections between SSMs and variants of attention, connected through various decompositions of a well-studied class of structured semiseparable matrices. Our state space duality (SSD) framework allows us to design a new architecture (Mamba-2) whose core layer is an a refinement of Mamba's selective SSM that is 2-8X faster, while continuing to be competitive with Transformers on language modeling.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 154  (*Influential: 36*)\n\n#### 4. Is Space-Time Attention All You Need for Video Understanding?\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Gedas Bertasius, Heng Wang, L. Torresani*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively on self-attention over space and time, which adapts the standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning directly from a sequence of frame-level patches.\n\n**Abstract:** We present a convolution-free approach to video classification built exclusively on self-attention over space and time. Our method, named\"TimeSformer,\"adapts the standard Transformer architecture to video by enabling spatiotemporal feature learning directly from a sequence of frame-level patches. Our experimental study compares different self-attention schemes and suggests that\"divided attention,\"where temporal attention and spatial attention are separately applied within each block, leads to the best video classification accuracy among the design choices considered. Despite the radically new design, TimeSformer achieves state-of-the-art results on several action recognition benchmarks, including the best reported accuracy on Kinetics-400 and Kinetics-600. Finally, compared to 3D convolutional networks, our model is faster to train, it can achieve dramatically higher test efficiency (at a small drop in accuracy), and it can also be applied to much longer video clips (over one minute long).

Is attention required for ICL? Exploring the Relationship Between Model Architecture and In-Context Learning Ability\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Ivan Lee, Nan Jiang, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick*\n\n**TL;DR:** This empirical study evaluates thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks, finding that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented.\n\n**Abstract:** What is the relationship between model architecture and the ability to perform in-context learning? In this empirical study, we take the first steps toward answering this question. We evaluate thirteen model architectures capable of causal language modeling across a suite of synthetic in-context learning tasks. These selected architectures represent a broad range of paradigms, including recurrent and convolution-based neural networks, transformers, state space model inspired, and other emerging attention alternatives. We discover that all the considered architectures can perform in-context learning under a wider range of conditions than previously documented. Additionally, we observe stark differences in statistical efficiency and consistency by varying the number of in-context examples and task difficulty. We also measure each architecture's predisposition towards in-context learning when presented with the option to memorize rather than leverage in-context examples. Finally, and somewhat surprisingly, we find that several attention alternatives are sometimes competitive with or better in-context learners than transformers. However, no single architecture demonstrates consistency across all tasks, with performance either plateauing or declining when confronted with a significantly larger number of in-context examples than those encountered during gradient-based training.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 8  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. An Empirical Study of Mamba-based Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Bryan Catanzaro, Mohammad Shoeybi, Jan Kautz, Jared Casper, Vartika Singh, Garvit Kulshreshtha, Deepak Narayanan, Sudhakar Singh, Ali Hatamizadeh, Albert Gu, Tri Dao, Vijay Korthikanti, Brandon Norick, Duncan Riach, Wonmin Byeon, Roger Waleffe*\n\n**Abstract:** Selective state-space models (SSMs) like Mamba overcome some of the shortcomings of Transformers, such as quadratic computational complexity with sequence length and large inference-time memory requirements from the key-value cache. Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-12\n\n\n\n#### 2. Samba: Simple Hybrid State Space Models for Efficient Unlimited Context Language Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Weizhu Chen, Chen Liang, Yelong Shen, Yadong Lu, Yang Liu, Liliang Ren*\n\n**Abstract:** Efficiently modeling sequences with infinite context length has been a long-standing problem. Past works suffer from either the quadratic computation complexity or the limited extrapolation ability on length generalization. In this work, we present Samba, a simple hybrid architecture that layer-wise combines Mamba, a selective State Space Model (SSM), with Sliding Window Attention (SWA). Samba selectively compresses a given sequence into recurrent hidden states while still maintaining the ability to precisely recall memories with the attention mechanism. We scale Samba up to 3.8B parameters with 3.2T training tokens and show that Samba substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art models based on pure attention or SSMs on a wide range of benchmarks. When trained on 4K length sequences, Samba can be efficiently extrapolated to 256K context length with perfect memory recall and show improved token predictions up to 1M context length. As a linear-time sequence model, Samba enjoys a 3.73x higher throughput compared to Transformers with grouped-query attention when processing user prompts of 128K length, and 3.64x speedup when generating 64K tokens with unlimited streaming. A sample implementation of Samba is publicly available in https://github.com/microsoft/Samba.\n\n**Published:** 2024-06-11\n\n\n\n#### 3. TransBTSV2: Towards Better and More Efficient Volumetric Segmentation of Medical Images\n\n*From Search Query: hybrid architecture state space attention*\n\n*Jing Wang, Hong Yu, Sen Zha, Tianxiang Zhang, Chen Chen, Wenxuan Wang, Jiangyun Li*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformer, benefiting from global (long-range) information modeling using self-attention mechanism, has been successful in natural language processing and computer vision recently. Convolutional Neural Networks, capable of capturing local features, are difficult to model explicit long-distance dependencies from global feature space. However, both local and global features are crucial for dense prediction tasks, especially for 3D medical image segmentation. In this paper, we present the further attempt to exploit Transformer in 3D CNN for 3D medical image volumetric segmentation and propose a novel network named TransBTSV2 based on the encoder-decoder structure. Different from TransBTS, the proposed TransBTSV2 is not limited to brain tumor segmentation (BTS) but focuses on general medical image segmentation, providing a stronger and more efficient 3D baseline for volumetric segmentation of medical images. As a hybrid CNN-Transformer architecture, TransBTSV2 can achieve accurate segmentation of medical images without any pre-training, possessing the strong inductive bias as CNNs and powerful global context modeling ability as Transformer. With the proposed insight to redesign the internal structure of Transformer block and the introduced Deformable Bottleneck Module to capture shape-aware local details, a highly efficient architecture is achieved with superior performance. Extensive experimental results on four medical image datasets (BraTS 2019, BraTS 2020, LiTS 2017 and KiTS 2019) demonstrate that TransBTSV2 achieves comparable or better results compared to the state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain tumor, liver tumor as well as kidney tumor. Code will be publicly available at https://github.com/Wenxuan-1119/TransBTS.\n\n**Published:** 2022-01-30\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the autoregressive language model design by incorporating hybrid architectures that combine attention mechanisms with state space models or other complementary components, here are some key findings and references that align with your analysis and future search plan:\n\n## Hybrid Architectures Combining Attention and State Space Models\n\n### E-Tamba: Efficient Transformer-Mamba Layer Transplantation\nThis approach introduces a method for constructing hybrid models by fine-tuning pre-trained Transformer and State Space Model (SSM) layers. E-Tamba replaces non-critical upper Transformer layers with Mamba layers, achieving a balance between the long-context capabilities of Transformers and the memory efficiency of Mamba. This method is particularly useful for researchers with limited resources, as it does not require extensive pre-training on massive datasets.\n\n### Jamba and Recurrent-Gemma\nJamba is a pre-trained hybrid model that interleaves attention and Mamba layers in a 1:7 ratio, combining the strengths of both architectures. Recurrent-Gemma is another hybrid model that integrates the long-context processing of Transformers with the low-memory demands of SSMs. These models demonstrate how hybrid designs can outperform pure architectures in certain tasks.\n\n### Taipan: Hybrid Architecture with Selective Attention Layers\nTaipan combines the efficiency of Mamba with enhanced long-range dependency handling through Selective Attention Layers (SALs). This hybrid architecture addresses the limitations of Mamba in handling in-context retrieval and complex long-range dependencies by incorporating attention mechanisms that interact with distant tokens.\n\n## Efficient Implementations of Linear Attention\n\n### CosFormer\nWhile not directly mentioned in the searched results, CosFormer is a relevant reference from your analysis. It approximates softmax attention with linear complexity, maintaining key properties of attention mechanisms. This approach can be integrated into hybrid models to reduce computational complexity.\n\n## State Space Models (SSMs) and Their Complementary Strengths\n\n### Mamba Architecture\nThe Falcon Mamba 7B model, based on the Mamba architecture, demonstrates that pure SSM designs can achieve results comparable to or even superior to Transformer and hybrid models. This highlights the potential of SSMs in efficient language processing, especially in terms of memory usage and inference speed.\n\n### Expressive Capacity of SSMs\nSSMs are shown to be strong in star-free state tracking and bounded hierarchical structure, areas where Transformers struggle. This complementary strength makes SSMs a valuable component in hybrid architectures, particularly for tasks that require efficient state tracking and hierarchical structure modeling.\n\n## Position Encoding Improvements\n\n### NTK-Aware Scaled RoPE\nAlthough not directly mentioned in the searched results, NTK-aware scaled RoPE is another relevant reference from your analysis. This method uses a nonlinear interpolation scheme to improve position representation, allowing for accurate distinction of token positions even in long sequences. This can be integrated with hybrid models to enhance their ability to handle long contexts.\n\n### Summary of Key Findings\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: E-Tamba, Jamba, and Taipan demonstrate effective ways to combine attention mechanisms with state space models, balancing efficiency and expressiveness.\n- **Efficient Attention**: CosFormer and similar approaches can be integrated to reduce the quadratic complexity of traditional attention mechanisms.\n- **State Space Models**: Mamba and other SSMs offer advantages in memory efficiency and specific pattern recognition tasks, making them valuable components in hybrid designs.\n- **Position Encoding**: Improvements like NTK-aware scaled RoPE can enhance the ability of hybrid models to handle long sequences efficiently.\n\nThese findings and references should help the researchers in designing a more efficient and expressive autoregressive language model by leveraging the strengths of both attention mechanisms and state space models.\n",

Examples of systematic generalization (Fodor et al, 1988)\ninclude generalization to sequences longer than those seen during training-productivity, and algorithmic combinations of previously learned rules-systematicity. Despite recent efforts (Bahdanau et al., 2019, Korrel et al. 2019, Lake, 2019, Li et al., 2019, Russin et al., 2019, Csord\u00e1s et al., 2021), systematic generalization generally remains unsolved (Fodor \\& McLaughlin, 1990, Lake \\& Baroni, 2018, Liska et al., 2018, Greff et al., 2020, Hupkes et al., 2020). On some datasets, the best performing models are neuro-symbolic hybrids (Chen et al.| 2020, Liu et al. 2020) using task-specific symbolic functions. However, their applicability to other datasets remains limited (Furrer et al. 2020, Shaw et al., 2020). A big question is: which type of architectural inductive bias encourages the training process to select \"good\" solutions which generalize systematically? The popular Transformers (Vaswani et al. 2017) also often fail to generalize on algorithmic tasks (e.g. Liska et al. (2018); Dubois et al. (2020); Chaabouni et al. (2021); Csord\u00e1s et al. (2021); Onta\u00f1\u00f3n et al.(2021)), even on tasks with intuitive solutions that can be simply expressed in terms of Transformer attention patterns. Given an input sequence of length $N$ and a Transformer encoder of depth $T$, solving an algorithmic task is often all about routing the relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the $T$-by- $N$ grid represented by Transformer columns (illustrated in Figure 11(Left). Effectively the task is to learn to draw an adaptive control flow on the canvas of Transformer columns. In fact, recent work by Weiss et al. (2021) introduced a programming language called RASP, which is specifically designed to express solutions to sequence processing problems, and which has a direct equivalent to the operations in Transformer encoders. However, it is shown that Transformers learn solutions expressed in RASP only through intermediate supervision of attention patterns, and sometimes, even such supervision fails. Generally speaking, Transformers fail to find easily interpretable and/or symbolic solutions to algorithmic tasks. We conversely hypothesize that attention-based NNs that are able to find intuitive solutions (achieving interpretable attention patterns) could improve systematic generalization. [^0]Here we point out that regular Transformers lack some basic ingredients for learning such \"intuitive\" solutions to algorithmic problems. As a remedy, we propose simple architectural modifications to help them learn data routing. As a first step towards validating our model, we focus on the popular length generalization task of compositional table lookup (CTL; Liska et al. (2018); Hupkes et al. (2019); Dubois et al. (2020), as well as two more complex tasks: a simple arithmetic task and a variant of ListOps (Nangia \\& Bowman, 2018) designed to test the compositional generalization ability of NNs. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100\\% generalization accuracy (never reported before; Dubois et al. (2020)) on the CTL task, and obtains nearly perfect accuracy on both the proposed simple arithmetic and ListOps tasks. We show that the attention and gating patterns of NDR tend to be interpretable as plausible control flows. ## 2 Improving Transformers FOR LEARning Adaptive Control Flow\n\nWe argue that the following components are needed to build Transformers capable of learning adaptive control flow. First, composing known operations in an arbitrary order requires that all operations are available at every computational step. This can be easily achieved by sharing the weights of the layers, as is done in Universal Transformers (Dehghani et al. 2019). Second, the network should be sufficiently deep, at least as deep as the deepest data dependency in the computational graph built from elementary operations (e.g., in the case of a parse tree, this is the depth of the tree). Otherwise, multiple operations must be fused into a single layer and hinder natural and elegant compositions. Third, inputs in some columns should be kept unchanged until it is their turn to be processed. The regular Transformer lacks a mechanism for skipping the whole transformation step by simply copying the input to the next step/layer. We propose a special gating function, copy gate, to implement such a mechanism (Sec.\n```\n\n#### 2. A Unified Implicit Attention Formulation for Gated-Linear Recurrent Sequence Models  (Avg.

In this paper, we present a unified view of these models, formulating such layers as implicit causal self-attention layers. The formulation includes most of their sub-components and is not limited to a specific part of the architecture. The framework compares the underlying mechanisms on similar grounds for different layers and provides a direct means for applying explainability methods. Our experiments show that our attention matrices and attribution method outperform an alternative and a more limited formulation that was recently proposed for Mamba. For the other architectures for which our method is the first to provide such a view, our method is effective and competitive in the relevant metrics compared to the results obtained by state-of-the-art transformer explainability methods.

We set out to simplify this process by grounding it in an end-to-end mechanistic architecture design (MAD) pipeline, encompassing small-scale capability unit tests predictive of scaling laws. Through a suite of synthetic token manipulation tasks such as compression and recall, designed to probe capabilities, we identify and test new hybrid architectures constructed from a variety of computational primitives. We experimentally validate the resulting architectures via an extensive compute-optimal and a new state-optimal scaling law analysis, training over 500 language models between 70M to 7B parameters. Surprisingly, we find MAD synthetics to correlate with compute-optimal perplexity, enabling accurate evaluation of new architectures via isolated proxy tasks. The new architectures found via MAD, based on simple ideas such as hybridization and sparsity, outperform state-of-the-art Transformer, convolutional, and recurrent architectures (Transformer++, Hyena, Mamba) in scaling, both at compute-optimal budgets and in overtrained regimes. Overall, these results provide evidence that performance on curated synthetic tasks can be predictive of scaling laws, and that an optimal architecture should leverage specialized layers via a hybrid topology.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 6/40 (Score: 0.02)*\n\n```\non pp. 1, 2, 9, 16).

Sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a viable approach to address this issue by decoupling model size from computational cost. The recent discovery of the fine-grained MoE scaling law shows that higher granularity leads to better performance. However, existing MoE models are limited to a small number of experts due to computational and optimization challenges. This paper introduces PEER (parameter efficient expert retrieval), a novel layer design that utilizes the product key technique for sparse retrieval from a vast pool of tiny experts (over a million). Experiments on language modeling tasks demonstrate that PEER layers outperform dense FFWs and coarse-grained MoEs in terms of performance-compute trade-off. By enabling efficient utilization of a massive number of experts, PEER unlocks the potential for further scaling of transformer models while maintaining computational efficiency.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/21 (Score: 0.01)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1312.4461, 2013.

Neural Routing by Memory\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture interaction patterns routing mechanisms*\n\n*Kaipeng Zhang, Zhenqiang Li, Zhifeng Li, Wei Liu, Yoichi Sato*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a routing-by-memory mechanism for existing CNN architectures that relieves each procedure\u2019s learning difficulty and thus leads to superior performance and improves VGGNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet's accuracies on Tiny ImageNet, Image net, and CIFAR-100 benchmarks with a negligible extra computational cost.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have achieved significant success by stacking multiple convolutional blocks, named procedures in this paper, to extract semantic features. However, they use the same procedure sequence for all inputs, regardless of the intermediate features. This paper proffers a simple yet effective idea of constructing parallel procedures and assigning similar intermediate features to the same specialized procedures in a divide-and-conquer fashion. It relieves each procedure\u2019s learning difficulty and thus leads to superior performance. Specifically, we propose a routing-by-memory mechanism for existing CNN architectures. In each stage of the network, we introduce parallel Procedural Units (PUs). A PU consists of a memory head and a procedure. The memory head maintains a summary of a type of features. For an intermediate feature, we search its closest memory and forward it to the corresponding procedure in both training and testing. In this way, different procedures are tailored to different features and therefore tackle them better. Networks with the proposed mechanism can be trained efficiently using a four-step training strategy. Experimental results show that our method improves VGGNet, ResNet, and EfficientNet\u2019s accuracies on Tiny ImageNet, ImageNet, and CIFAR-100 benchmarks with a negligible extra computational cost.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 3  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

We propose a two-step method, based on composable adapters, to deal with this problem of Multimodal Robustness. In a first step, we separately learn domain adapters and modality specific adapters, to deal with noisy input coming from various sources: ASR, OCR, or noisy text (UGC). In a second step, we combine these components at runtime via dynamic routing or, when the source of noise is unknown, via two new transfer learning mechanisms (Fast Fusion and Multi Fusion). We show that our method provides a flexible, state-of-the-art, architecture able to deal with noisy multimodal inputs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3.

The situation is especially frustrating in the case of algorithmic tasks, where they often fail to find intuitive solutions that route relevant information to the right node/operation at the right time in the grid represented by Transformer columns. To facilitate the learning of useful control flow, we propose two modifications to the Transformer architecture, copy gate and geometric attention. Our novel Neural Data Router (NDR) achieves 100% length generalization accuracy on the classic compositional table lookup task, as well as near-perfect accuracy on the simple arithmetic task and a new variant of ListOps testing for generalization across computational depths. NDR's attention and gating patterns tend to be interpretable as an intuitive form of neural routing.

DSTAGNN: Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network for Traffic Flow Forecasting\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture interaction patterns routing mechanisms*\n\n*Shiyong Lan, Yitong Ma, Wei Huang, Wenwu Wang, Hongyu Yang, P. Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network and design a novel graph neural network architecture that can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution.\n\n**Abstract:** As a typical problem in time series analysis, traffic flow prediction is one of the most important application fields of machine learning. However, achieving highly accurate tra ffi c flow prediction is a challenging task, due to the presence of complex dynamic spatial-temporal dependencies within a road network. This paper proposes a novel Dynamic Spatial-Temporal Aware Graph Neural Network (DSTAGNN) to model the complex spatial-temporal interaction in road network. First, considering the fact that historical data carries intrinsic dynamic information about the spatial structure of road networks, we propose a new dynamic spatial-temporal aware graph based on a data-driven strategy to replace the pre-defined static graph usually used in traditional graph convolution. Second, we design a novel graph neural network architecture, which can not only represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes with an improved multi-head attention mechanism, but also acquire the wide range of dynamic temporal dependency from multi-receptive field features via multi-scale gated convolution. Extensive experiments on real-world data sets demonstrate that our proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 165  (*Influential: 17*)\n\n#### 5. ReTR: Modeling Rendering Via Transformer for Generalizable Neural Surface Reconstruction\n\n*From Search Query: neural architecture interaction patterns routing mechanisms*\n\n*Yixun Liang, Hao He, Yingke Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** ReTR is a novel framework that leverages the transformer architecture to redesign the rendering process, enabling complex render interaction modeling and introduces a learnable meta-ray token and utilizes the cross-attention mechanism to simulate the interaction of rendering process with sampled points and render the observed color.\n\n**Abstract:** Generalizable neural surface reconstruction techniques have attracted great attention in recent years. However, they encounter limitations of low confidence depth distribution and inaccurate surface reasoning due to the oversimplified volume rendering process employed. In this paper, we present Reconstruction TRansformer (ReTR), a novel framework that leverages the transformer architecture to redesign the rendering process, enabling complex render interaction modeling. It introduces a learnable $\\textit{meta-ray token}$ and utilizes the cross-attention mechanism to simulate the interaction of rendering process with sampled points and render the observed color. Meanwhile, by operating within a high-dimensional feature space rather than the color space, ReTR mitigates sensitivity to projected colors in source views. Such improvements result in accurate surface assessment with high confidence. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various datasets, showcasing how our method outperforms the current state-of-the-art approaches in terms of reconstruction quality and generalization ability. $\\textit{Our code is available at }$ https://github.com/YixunLiang/ReTR.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on hybrid architectures that combine attention mechanisms with state space models (SSMs), here are some key insights and relevant information from the provided analysis and additional sources:\n\n## Mechanisms for Component Interaction\n\n### Layer-wise and Hierarchical Combination\nStudies have shown that combining attention and SSMs in a layer-wise or hierarchical manner can leverage the strengths of both components. For example, the \"Mamba\" paper suggests using SSM parameters as functions of the input to address the weaknesses of pure SSM approaches, which can be integrated with attention layers to enhance content-based reasoning[3,.\n\n### Selective Activation and Dynamic Routing\nThe concept of Sparse Modular Activation (SMA) introduced in the \"SeqBoat\" paper is particularly relevant. SMA allows neural networks to sparsely and dynamically activate sub-modules for sequence elements, which can be applied to hybrid architectures to optimize information flow and reduce computational complexity.\n\n## Information Flow and Routing Mechanisms\n\n### Efficient Information Flow\nTo ensure efficient information flow between different components, the integration of attention and SSMs must be carefully balanced. The \"Understanding Differences\" paper provides a framework for comparing and combining different approaches, highlighting the importance of rigorous comparisons to understand the distinctive characteristics of each model class.\n\n### Dynamic and Adaptive Processing\nDynamic routing mechanisms, such as those enabled by SMA, allow for selective computation based on the content of the input. This approach can be extended to hybrid architectures to adaptively choose between attention and SSM components, optimizing both efficiency and performance.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations\n\n### Block-Based Processing\nBlock-based processing, as mentioned in the analysis, is crucial for hardware efficiency. This involves processing sequences in blocks rather than sequentially, which can be particularly beneficial when combining attention and SSMs. Papers like \"Short-Long Convolutions Help Hardware-Efficient Linear Attention\" provide insights into optimizing hybrid architectures for hardware efficiency.\n\n### Linear Complexity Approximations\nLinear attention variants, such as those discussed in the \"CHELA\" paper, reduce computational complexity while maintaining performance. These approximations can be integrated into hybrid architectures to ensure that the combination of attention and SSMs remains computationally efficient.\n\n## Feature Interaction and Non-Linear Relationships\n\n### Feature Interaction Mechanisms\nUnderstanding feature interactions, as discussed in the \"Feature Interaction In Neural Networks\" article, is crucial for capturing non-linear relationships between features. In the context of hybrid architectures, feature interaction mechanisms can help in combining the outputs of attention and SSM components effectively, enhancing the overall performance of the model.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nTo achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on the following:\n\n- **Hybrid Architectures**: Combine attention mechanisms with SSMs using layer-wise, hierarchical, or selective activation approaches.\n- **Dynamic Routing**: Implement dynamic routing mechanisms like SMA to selectively activate components based on input content.\n- **Efficiency Optimizations**: Use block-based processing and linear complexity approximations to ensure hardware efficiency.\n- **Feature Interactions**: Utilize feature interaction mechanisms to capture non-linear relationships between the outputs of different components.\n\nBy integrating these strategies, researchers can develop more efficient, scalable, and performant autoregressive language models.\n",

We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens.

The model is able to find the definition of a lemma from a reference to it. The retrieved surrounding context (highlighted) is the definition body of the mathematical object highlighted in the querying context. Retrieving mathematical definitions. Our case study on the Isabelle corpus provides one of the clearest illustrations of how a model can make good use of external memory. When predicting the name of a mathematical object or a lemma, the model looked up the definition from earlier in the proof. Examples of this behavior are shown in Table 8 . In example 1, the model retrieves a definition within the body of a lemma, markov_inequality. In example 2, it retrieves the definition of a previously defined concept subgraph_threshold. In example 3, it retrieves the definition of orthonormal_system. We manually checked 10 examples where the model made a prediction of lemma names, and 8 out of 10 times model found the body of the lemma it needs to predict. In the other two cases, the model also looked up materials in the immediate vicinity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that attention is capable of looking up definitions and function bodies from a large corpus. The Isabelle case study used a model with two memory layers of size 32 K . ## 5 CONCLUSION\n\nWe present a simple extension to the Transformer architecture, called $k \\mathrm{NN}$-augmented attention, which dramatically increases the length of the context that a language model can attend to by using $k$-nearest-neighbor lookup into a large external memory. We demonstrate the effectiveness of external memory in a series of language modeling experiments over a variety of long-document datasets, including LaTeX documents, source code, formal proofs, and books. The Memorizing Transformer shows large improvements in perplexity over the baseline for all of the data sets and architectures that we studied; it is comparable to a vanilla transformer that has 5 times the number of parameters. Perplexity continues to improve with increasing memory size, although there is a point of diminishing returns. Moreover, external memory continues to provide benefits even as the transformer is scaled up from 200M to 8B parameters. Perhaps most intriguingly, a Memorizing Transformer does not need to be pre-trained from scratch; it is possible obtain large gains from adding memory to an existing pre-trained model, and then fine-tuning it. Unlike other forms of attention, $k \\mathrm{NN}$ retrieval can be easily scaled up to huge memory sizes, and is thus potentially able to leverage vast knowledge bases or code repositories. How to make the best use of this capability is a topic for future work. ## ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe want to thank Charles Staats for the many fruitful discussions and detailed comments, Henryk Michalewski for early version of of the memory implementation, Petros Maniatis for his help with our code datasets, Aitor Lewkowycz for his help with larger scale memorizing transformer experiments, Behnam Neyshabur for his comments on finetuning non-memory models, Imanol Schlag for his proofread and detailed comments, and Dennis Lee and Manzil Zaheer for discussions about large-scale attention and retrieval. ## ETHICS\n\nThe ability to memorize large databases of facts could have potential ramifications for society, especially if those databases include sensitive personal information or copyrighted works. However, one advantage of using an external memory is that the memory can be easily cleared of all such information, as we do at the end of each document that we train on. The same is not true of differentiable model parameters, which is what most existing architectures use to store facts and information that they are trained on. ## REPRODUCIBILITY\n\nDetails of our architecture and training hyperparameters are given in Section 4.2. The datasets for C4 and PG-19 are publicly available. Our additional datasets, Github, Isabelle, and ArXiv Math are derived from publicly available data buckets, which we link in the main part of the paper. Subsection 4.1 include details on how we constructed the datasets from those datasets. We plan to release our code as open source. ## REFERENCES\n\nJoshua Ainslie, Santiago Onta\u00f1\u00f3n, Chris Alberti, Vaclav Cvicek, Zachary Fisher, Philip Pham, Anirudh Ravula, Sumit Sanghai, Qifan Wang, and Li Yang.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.74)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

As more and more data becomes available for training, these networks are increasingly larger [19]. For instance, recent models both in vision [29] and in natural language processing [20, 36, 28] have more than a billion parameters. The higher-capacity enables better modeling of data like natural text or images, and it also improves generalization [41, 33]. Unfortunately, increasing capacity has led to a dramatic increase of computational complexity, both at training and inference time [20]. There is a growing interest in developing architectures with reasonable computational complexity. Recently, there has been some efforts to develop high capacity architectures that operate on a limited computational budget [40, 18]. This is well illustrated by the \"On-device Visual Intelligence Challenge\" [5], which specifically focuses on the complexity/accuracy trade-off for image classification.\n```\n\n\n\n---\n## Found 5 related papers from 1 external sources\n\n\n\nYour 1 raw search queries input to the search frame: memory augmentation language models geometric attention\n\nConsidering refining your search by improving the query keywords input.\n\n### 5 related papers from Semantic Scholar\n\n#### 1. Training Language Models with Memory Augmentation\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation language models geometric attention*\n\n*Zexuan Zhong, Tao Lei, Danqi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work presents TRIME, a novel yet simple training approach designed for training LMs with memory augmentation that adds negligible computational overhead and is compatible with different neural architectures, making it a versatile solution for training memory-augmented LMs.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent work has improved language models (LMs) remarkably by equipping them with a non-parametric memory component. However, most existing approaches only introduce mem-ories at testing time or represent them using a separately trained encoder, resulting in suboptimal training of the language model. In this work, we present TRIME, a novel yet simple training approach designed for training LMs with memory augmentation. Our approach uses a training objective that directly takes in-batch examples as accessible memory. We also present new methods for memory construction and data batching, which are used for adapting to different sets of memories\u2014local, long-term, and external memory\u2014at testing time. We evaluate TRIME on multiple language modeling and machine translation benchmarks and show that it is able to achieve significant improvements across all the settings. Concretely, TRIME reduces the perplexity from 18.70 to 15.37 on WIKITEXT-103, by effectively leveraging a large memory set from the training corpus. Compared to standard LM training, TRIME adds negligible computational overhead and is compatible with different neural architectures, making it a versatile solution for training memory-augmented LMs.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 115  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 2. Efficient Streaming Language Models with Attention Sinks\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation language models geometric attention*\n\n*Guangxuan Xiao, Yuandong Tian, Beidi Chen, Song Han, Mike Lewis*\n\n**TL;DR:** StreamingLLM is introduced, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning and can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.\n\n**Abstract:** Deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in streaming applications such as multi-round dialogue, where long interactions are expected, is urgently needed but poses two major challenges. Firstly, during the decoding stage, caching previous tokens' Key and Value states (KV) consumes extensive memory. Secondly, popular LLMs cannot generalize to longer texts than the training sequence length. Window attention, where only the most recent KVs are cached, is a natural approach -- but we show that it fails when the text length surpasses the cache size. We observe an interesting phenomenon, namely attention sink, that keeping the KV of initial tokens will largely recover the performance of window attention. In this paper, we first demonstrate that the emergence of attention sink is due to the strong attention scores towards initial tokens as a\"sink\"even if they are not semantically important. Based on the above analysis, we introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a finite length attention window to generalize to infinite sequence lengths without any fine-tuning. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more. In addition, we discover that adding a placeholder token as a dedicated attention sink during pre-training can further improve streaming deployment. In streaming settings, StreamingLLM outperforms the sliding window recomputation baseline by up to 22.2x speedup.

Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

H2O: Heavy-Hitter Oracle for Efficient Generative Inference of Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation language models geometric attention*\n\n*Zhenyu (Allen) Zhang, Ying Sheng, Tianyi Zhou, Tianlong Chen, Lianmin Zheng, Ruisi Cai, Zhao Song, Yuandong Tian, Christopher R\u00e9, Clark W. Barrett, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen*\n\n**TL;DR:** A novel approach for implementing the KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens is introduced and a theoretical guarantee for the novel eviction algorithm is proved.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their recent impressive accomplishments, are notably cost-prohibitive to deploy, particularly for applications involving long-content generation, such as dialogue systems and story writing. Often, a large amount of transient state information, referred to as the KV cache, is stored in GPU memory in addition to model parameters, scaling linearly with the sequence length and batch size. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for implementing the KV cache which significantly reduces its memory footprint. Our approach is based on the noteworthy observation that a small portion of tokens contributes most of the value when computing attention scores. We call these tokens Heavy Hitters (H$_2$). Through a comprehensive investigation, we find that (i) the emergence of H$_2$ is natural and strongly correlates with the frequent co-occurrence of tokens in the text, and (ii) removing them results in significant performance degradation. Based on these insights, we propose Heavy Hitter Oracle (H$_2$O), a KV cache eviction policy that dynamically retains a balance of recent and H$_2$ tokens. We formulate the KV cache eviction as a dynamic submodular problem and prove (under mild assumptions) a theoretical guarantee for our novel eviction algorithm which could help guide future work. We validate the accuracy of our algorithm with OPT, LLaMA, and GPT-NeoX across a wide range of tasks. Our implementation of H$_2$O with 20% heavy hitters improves the throughput over three leading inference systems DeepSpeed Zero-Inference, Hugging Face Accelerate, and FlexGen by up to 29$\\times$, 29$\\times$, and 3$\\times$ on OPT-6.7B and OPT-30B. With the same batch size, H2O can reduce the latency by up to 1.9$\\times$.

Adaptive Chameleon or Stubborn Sloth: Revealing the Behavior of Large Language Models in Knowledge Conflicts\n\n*From Search Query: memory augmentation language models geometric attention*\n\n*Jian Xie, Kai Zhang, Jiangjie Chen, Renze Lou, Yu Su*\n\n**TL;DR:** This first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts is presented, and it is found that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing.\n\n**Abstract:** By providing external information to large language models (LLMs), tool augmentation (including retrieval augmentation) has emerged as a promising solution for addressing the limitations of LLMs' static parametric memory. However, how receptive are LLMs to such external evidence, especially when the evidence conflicts with their parametric memory? We present the first comprehensive and controlled investigation into the behavior of LLMs when encountering knowledge conflicts. We propose a systematic framework to elicit high-quality parametric memory from LLMs and construct the corresponding counter-memory, which enables us to conduct a series of controlled experiments. Our investigation reveals seemingly contradicting behaviors of LLMs. On the one hand, different from prior wisdom, we find that LLMs can be highly receptive to external evidence even when that conflicts with their parametric memory, given that the external evidence is coherent and convincing. On the other hand, LLMs also demonstrate a strong confirmation bias when the external evidence contains some information that is consistent with their parametric memory, despite being presented with conflicting evidence at the same time. These results pose important implications that are worth careful consideration for the further development and deployment of tool- and retrieval-augmented LLMs. Resources are available at https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/LLM-Knowledge-Conflict.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 20*)\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model (LM) design focusing on memory augmentation and geometric structures in attention mechanisms, here are some key findings and references that align with your goals:\n\n## Memory Augmentation in Language Models\n\n### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n- The concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is crucial for memory augmentation. Papers like \"M-RAG: Reinforcing Large Language Model Performance through Retrieval-Augmented Generation with Multiple Partitions\" introduce a multiple partition paradigm for RAG, which enhances LLM performance by retrieving relevant memories from an external database. This approach improves text summarization, machine translation, and dialogue generation tasks by optimizing language generation with multi-agent reinforcement learning.\n\n### Long-Term Memory Integration\n- Integrating long-term memory into AI systems, as discussed in the LangGraph agent article, can enhance LLMs by storing and recalling information over time. This involves using a Memory Store to persist information across multiple sessions, which can improve the model's ability to recall past interactions and provide more personalized and accurate responses.\n\n### Efficient Inference and Memory Management\n- The \"LAMPS\" approach for augmented LLMs focuses on efficient memory management during inference. It predicts memory consumption and optimizes API interactions to manage varying output sizes and memory handling strategies. This can be integrated with memory augmentation techniques to ensure efficient access patterns.\n\n## Geometric Structures in Attention Mechanisms\n\n### Geometric Attention\n- The concept of geometric attention, as mentioned in the analysis note, is important for capturing structural relationships. Papers like \"The Neural Data Router: Adaptive Control Flow in Transformers Improves Systematic Generalization\" propose modifications to the Transformer architecture, including geometric attention, which helps in systematic generalization and interpretable routing patterns [Analysis Note].\n\n### Spatial Relationship Modeling\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss geometric priors in attention mechanisms, the idea of spatial relationship modeling can be inferred from graph neural networks and other structured models. For example, the DSTAGNN model, though not directly related to language models, demonstrates how to represent dynamic spatial relevance among nodes using improved multi-head attention mechanisms. This concept can be adapted to language models to model spatial relationships effectively[Analysis Note].\n\n## Efficient Access Patterns and Spatial Relationship Modeling\n\n### Chaining Prompts and Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n- Techniques like chaining prompts and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can extend the model\u2019s capacity by breaking down tasks or retrieving external data. This helps in handling complex tasks that require large amounts of information without exceeding memory limits, thus improving efficient access patterns.\n\n### Dynamic Routing Mechanisms\n- Dynamic routing mechanisms, such as those proposed in the Neural Data Router and Neural Routing by Memory papers, provide efficient content-dependent processing. These mechanisms can be combined with geometric attention to capture structural relationships and improve the overall efficiency of the model[Analysis Note].\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive LM design, researchers should focus on:\n\n- Implementing retrieval-augmented generation with multiple partitions to enhance memory augmentation.\n- Integrating long-term memory mechanisms to improve context-aware interactions.\n- Optimizing memory management during inference using approaches like LAMPS.\n- Utilizing geometric attention and dynamic routing mechanisms to capture structural relationships and improve systematic generalization[Analysis Note].\n- Employing techniques like chaining prompts and RAG to handle complex tasks efficiently.\n\nThese approaches can help in designing more efficient, scalable, and accurate autoregressive language models.\n",

Soatto*\n\n**Published in:**  (2024)\t**Cited by** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n**TL;DR:** N/A\n\n**Abstract:** We describe a family of architectures to support transductive inference by allowing memory to grow to a finite but a-priori unknown bound while making efficient use of finite resources for inference. Current architectures use such resources to represent data either eidetically over a finite span (\"context\"in Transformers), or fading over an infinite span (in State Space Models, or SSMs). Recent hybrid architectures have combined eidetic and fading memory, but with limitations that do not allow the designer or the learning process to seamlessly modulate the two, nor to extend the eidetic memory span. We leverage ideas from Stochastic Realization Theory to develop a class of models called B'MOJO to seamlessly combine eidetic and fading memory within an elementary composable module. The overall architecture can be used to implement models that can access short-term eidetic memory\"in-context,\"permanent structural memory\"in-weights,\"fading memory\"in-state,\"and long-term eidetic memory\"in-storage\"by natively incorporating retrieval from an asynchronously updated memory. We show that Transformers, existing SSMs such as Mamba, and hybrid architectures such as Jamba are special cases of B'MOJO and describe a basic implementation, to be open sourced, that can be stacked and scaled efficiently in hardware. We test B'MOJO on transductive inference tasks, such as associative recall, where it outperforms existing SSMs and Hybrid models; as a baseline, we test ordinary language modeling where B'MOJO achieves perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and SSMs up to 1.4B parameters, while being up to 10% faster to train. Finally, we show that B'MOJO's ability to modulate eidetic and fading memory results in better inference on longer sequences tested up to 32K tokens, four-fold the length of the longest sequences seen during training.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 26/30 (Score: 1.00)*\n\n```\n[42] Terry A.

Introduction\n\nIn the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), understanding and managing long context represents one of the significant challenges for achieving in-depth language comprehension. Research into long context not only enhances the model's capabilities in processing lengthy dialogues, document comprehension, and information retrieval tasks but also aids in achieving more precise language inference and knowledge extraction, thereby facilitating progress in\n\n[^0]applications such as machine translation, summarization, and question-answering systems(Yang et al., 2023). In these tasks, users expect language models to access as much information as possible, necessitating a method that can effectively store and retrieve information. An essential direction for improving long-context processing involves information compression, encapsulating prior key-value (KV) information within a few specialized tokens. Previous efforts, such as (Mu et al., 2023), have achieved this goal with relative efficacy. However, a notable limitation of these methods is their lossy nature of compression, which inevitably leads to the loss of vital information during the process. We propose a novel approach, the Lossless Compressed Memory Attention (LoMA), which divides sequence into multiple chunks of equal length, each chunk structured to include a reading zone, a memory zone and a repetition zone. The latter two zones incorporate newly introduced special tokens: ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' and ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ '. We also designed a unique attention matrix mask: the reading zone employs a conventional autoregressive lower triangular mask; in order to facilitate better internal information transmission and communication, the memory zone employs a bidirectional attention mechanism and they can attend to reading zone; tokens in the repetition zone can only observe the memory zone directly preceding it, as well as the token itself. With this masking strategy, the ' $<\\mathrm{r}>$ ' token in the repetition zone needs to faithfully reproduce the text content of the reading zone, while only being able to attend to the $<\\mathrm{m}>$ tokens in the memory zone. This implies that the ' $<\\mathrm{m}>$ ' tokens quickly learn to compress the entire content of the reading zone into their own KV. We have also mathematically demonstrated that the loss function generated in the repetition zone can indirectly supervise the training of the model in the memory zone, obviating the need for constructing labels and computing loss for the tokens in the memory zone. Through the generative algorithm of LoMA, transformer models acquire the ability to compress memory losslessly within the memory zone, substantially extending the length of the long-context they are capable of handling and significantly reducing computational and memory costs. Our experiments show that the Llama-2-7B model(Touvron et al.,\n\n![](https://cdn.mathpix.com/cropped/2024_09_12_dce00b655b99311c4676g-02.jpg?height=519&width=1743&top_left_y=204&top_left_x=159)\n\nFigure 1: Comparison of the standard transformer model with the LoMA model in autoregressive generation: (a) In the standard transformer model's autoregressive generation, the input token and the previous context's KV cache are fed together into the attention module to compute and predict the next token.

Importantly, our approach does not modify the model's architecture or rely on additional auxiliary models.

Loki: Low-Rank Keys for Efficient Sparse Attention (Avg. Score: 0.99)\n\n*Prajwal Singhania, Siddharth Singh, Shwai He, S. Feizi, A.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.99)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

However, large models often involve massive computational costs, and practical applications cannot afford such high prices. However, the method of constructing a strong model architecture for LLMs is rarely discussed. We first analyze the state-of-the-art language model architectures and observe the feature collapse problem. Based on the theoretical analysis, we propose that the nonlinearity is also very important for language models, which is usually studied in convolutional neural networks for vision tasks. The series informed activation function is then introduced with tiny calculations that can be ignored, and an augmented shortcut is further used to enhance the model nonlinearity. We then demonstrate that the proposed approach is significantly effective for enhancing the model nonlinearity through carefully designed ablations; thus, we present a new efficient model architecture for establishing modern, namely, PanGu-$\\pi$. Experiments are then conducted using the same dataset and training strategy to compare PanGu-$\\pi$ with state-of-the-art LLMs. The results show that PanGu-$\\pi$-7B can achieve a comparable performance to that of benchmarks with about 10\\% inference speed-up, and PanGu-$\\pi$-1B can achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency. In addition, we have deployed PanGu-$\\pi$-7B in the high-value domains of finance and law, developing an LLM named YunShan for practical application. The results show that YunShan can surpass other models with similar scales on benchmarks.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/62 (Score: 0.97)*\n\n```\n[36] J. W. Rae et al.

Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression\n\n*From Search Query: model compression attention optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Miao Zhang, Li Wang, David Campos, Wei Huang, Chenjuan Guo, B. Yang*\n\n**TL;DR:** A framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression (WML), which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks and produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Online distillation attracts attention from the community as it simplifies the traditional two-stage knowledge distillation process into a single stage. Online distillation collaboratively trains a group of peer models, which are treated as students, and all students gain extra knowledge from each other. However, memory consumption and diversity among students are two key challenges to the scalability and quality of online distillation. To address the two challenges, this paper presents a framework called Weighted Mutual Learning with Diversity-Driven Model Compression ( WML ) for online distillation. First, at the base of a hierarchical structure where students share different parts, we leverage the structured network pruning to generate diversified students with different models sizes, thus also helping reduce the memory requirements. Second, rather than taking the average of students, this paper, for the first time, leverages a bi-level formulation to estimate the relative importance of students with a close-form, to further boost the effectiveness of the distillation from each other. Extensive experiments show the generalization of the proposed framework, which outperforms existing online distillation methods on a variety of deep neural networks. More interesting, as a byproduct, WML produces a series of students with different model sizes in a single run, which also achieves competitive results compared with existing channel pruning methods.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 2.

Different from the conventional KV cache that retains key and value vectors for all context tokens, we conduct targeted profiling to discern the intrinsic structure of attention modules. Based on the recognized structure, we then construct the KV cache in an adaptive manner: evicting long-range contexts on attention heads emphasizing local contexts, discarding non-special tokens on attention heads centered on special tokens, and only employing the standard KV cache for attention heads that broadly attend to all tokens. Moreover, with the lightweight attention profiling used to guide the construction of the adaptive KV cache, FastGen can be deployed without resource-intensive fine-tuning or re-training. In our experiments across various asks, FastGen demonstrates substantial reduction on GPU memory consumption with negligible generation quality loss. We will release our code and the compatible CUDA kernel for reproducibility.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 102  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 3. Network Memory Footprint Compression Through Jointly Learnable Codebooks and Mappings\n\n*From Search Query: model compression attention optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Edouard Yvinec, Arnaud Dapogny, K\u00e9vin Bailly*\n\n**TL;DR:** The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Abstract:** The massive interest in deep neural networks (DNNs) for both computer vision and natural language processing has been sparked by the growth in computational power. However, this led to an increase in the memory footprint, to a point where it can be challenging to simply load a model on commodity devices such as mobile phones. To address this limitation, quantization is a favored solution as it maps high precision tensors to a low precision, memory efficient format. In terms of memory footprint reduction, its most effective variants are based on codebooks. These methods, however, suffer from two limitations. First, they either define a single codebook for each tensor, or use a memory-expensive mapping to multiple codebooks. Second, gradient descent optimization of the mapping favors jumps toward extreme values, hence not defining a proximal search. In this work, we propose to address these two limitations. First, we initially group similarly distributed neurons and leverage the re-ordered structure to either apply different scale factors to the different groups, or map weights that fall in these groups to several codebooks, without any mapping overhead. Second, stemming from this initialization, we propose a joint learning of the codebook and weight mappings that bears similarities with recent gradient-based post-training quantization techniques. Third, drawing estimation from straight-through estimation techniques, we introduce a novel gradient update definition to enable a proximal search of the codebooks and their mappings. The proposed jointly learnable codebooks and mappings (JLCM) method allows a very efficient approximation of any DNN: as such, a Llama 7B can be compressed down to 2Go and loaded on 5-year-old smartphones.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. InstOptima: Evolutionary Multi-objective Instruction Optimization via Large Language Model-based Instruction Operators\n\n*From Search Query: model compression attention optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Heng Yang, Ke Li*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel approach that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem and introduces an objective-guided mechanism for instruction operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions.\n\n**Abstract:** Instruction-based language modeling has received significant attention in pretrained language models. However, the efficiency of instruction engineering remains low and hinders the development of instruction studies. Recent studies have focused on automating instruction generation, but they primarily aim to improve performance without considering other crucial objectives that impact instruction quality, such as instruction length and perplexity. Therefore, we propose a novel approach (i.e., InstOptima) that treats instruction generation as an evolutionary multi-objective optimization problem. In contrast to text edition-based methods, our approach utilizes a large language model (LLM) to simulate instruction operators, including mutation and crossover. Furthermore, we introduce an objective-guided mechanism for these operators, allowing the LLM to comprehend the objectives and enhance the quality of the generated instructions. Experimental results demonstrate improved fine-tuning performance and the generation of a diverse set of high-quality instructions.\n\n**Venue:** Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 13  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Dynamic Memory Compression: Retrofitting LLMs for Accelerated Inference\n\n*From Search Query: model compression attention optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Piotr Nawrot, Adrian La'ncucki, Marcin Chochowski, David Tarjan, E. Ponti*\n\n**TL;DR:** Dynamic Memory Compression can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have emerged as the backbone of large language models (LLMs). However, generation remains inefficient due to the need to store in memory a cache of key-value representations for past tokens, whose size scales linearly with the input sequence length and batch size. As a solution, we propose Dynamic Memory Compression (DMC), a method for online key-value cache compression at inference time. Most importantly, the model learns to apply different compression ratios in different heads and layers. We retrofit pre-trained LLMs such as Llama 2 (7B, 13B and 70B) into DMC Transformers, achieving up to 7x throughput increase during auto-regressive inference on an NVIDIA H100 GPU. DMC is applied via continued pre-training on a negligible percentage of the original data without adding any extra parameters. DMC preserves the original downstream performance with up to 4x cache compression, outperforming up-trained grouped-query attention (GQA) and key-value eviction policies (H$_2$O, TOVA). GQA and DMC can be even combined to obtain compounded gains. Hence, DMC can serve as a drop-in replacement for KV caching in existing LLMs to fit longer contexts and larger batches within any given memory budget.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 25  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

In this work, we present an efficient and affordable post-training quantization approach to compress large Transformer-based models, termed as ZeroQuant. ZeroQuant is an end-to-end quantization and inference pipeline with three main components: (1) a fine-grained hardware-friendly quantization scheme for both weight and activations; (2) a novel affordable layer-by-layer knowledge distillation algorithm (LKD) even without the access to the original training data; (3) a highly-optimized quantization system backend support to remove the quantization/dequantization overhead. As such, we are able to show that: (1) ZeroQuant can reduce the precision for weights and activations to INT8 in a cost-free way for both BERT and GPT3-style models with minimal accuracy impact, which leads to up to 5.19x/4.16x speedup on those models compared to FP16 inference; (2) ZeroQuant plus LKD affordably quantize the weights in the fully-connected module to INT4 along with INT8 weights in the attention module and INT8 activations, resulting in 3x memory footprint reduction compared to the FP16 model; (3) ZeroQuant can be directly applied to two of the largest open-sourced language models, including GPT-J6B and GPT-NeoX20, for which our INT8 model achieves similar accuracy as the FP16 model but achieves up to 5.2x better efficiency.\n\n**Published:** 2022-06-04\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Gonzalez, Clark Barrett, Beidi Chen, Zhiqiang Xie, Daniel Y. Fu, Max Ryabinin, Zhuohan Li, Binhang Yuan, Lianmin Zheng, Ying Sheng*\n\n**Abstract:** The high computational and memory requirements of large language model (LLM) inference make it feasible only with multiple high-end accelerators. Motivated by the emerging demand for latency-insensitive tasks with batched processing, this paper initiates the study of high-throughput LLM inference using limited resources, such as a single commodity GPU. We present FlexGen, a high-throughput generation engine for running LLMs with limited GPU memory. FlexGen can be flexibly configured under various hardware resource constraints by aggregating memory and computation from the GPU, CPU, and disk. By solving a linear programming problem, it searches for efficient patterns to store and access tensors. FlexGen further compresses the weights and the attention cache to 4 bits with negligible accuracy loss. These techniques enable FlexGen to have a larger space of batch size choices and thus significantly increase maximum throughput. As a result, when running OPT-175B on a single 16GB GPU, FlexGen achieves significantly higher throughput compared to state-of-the-art offloading systems, reaching a generation throughput of 1 token/s for the first time with an effective batch size of 144. On the HELM benchmark, FlexGen can benchmark a 30B model with a 16GB GPU on 7 representative sub-scenarios in 21 hours.

ASVD: Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition for Compressing Large Language Models\n\n*From Search Query: model compression attention optimization memory efficiency*\n\n*Guangyu Sun, Yan Yan, Qiang Wu, Yue Song, Yuzhang Shang, Zhihang Yuan*\n\n**Abstract:** In this paper, we introduce a new post-training compression paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate their wider adoption. We delve into LLM weight low-rank factorization, and find that the challenges of this task stem from the outlier phenomenon in the LLM activations and the sensitivity difference among various kinds of layers. To address these issues, we propose a training-free approach called Activation-aware Singular Value Decomposition (ASVD). Specifically, ASVD manages activation outliers by scaling the weight matrix based on the activation distribution, thereby enhancing decomposition accuracy. Additionally, we propose an efficient iterative calibration process to optimize layer-specific decomposition by addressing the varying sensitivity of different LLM layers. ASVD can compress a network by 10-20%, without compromising the performance of LLMs. Based on the success of the low-rank decomposition of projection matrices in the self-attention module, we further introduce ASVD to compress the KV cache. By reducing the channel dimension of KV activations, memory requirements for KV cache can be largely reduced. Thanks to the 50-75% reduction in the rank of the KV projection matrices, ASVD can further achieve 50% KV cache reductions without performance drop in a training-free manner.\n\n**Published:** 2023-12-10\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve autoregressive language model design, focusing on compression techniques for attention mechanisms and memory structures, here are some key findings and references that align with your analysis and goals:\n\n## Dynamic Sparse Attention and Adaptive KV-Cache Compression\nThe paper on CASAK-V introduces dynamic sparse attention and adaptive KV-cache compression, which are crucial for efficient long-context processing in resource-constrained environments.

CASAK-V achieves perplexity scores close to full-attention models while reducing memory usage significantly, making it a promising approach for improving memory efficiency and attention optimization.\n\n## Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\nThe CompAct technique reduces peak memory utilization on GPUs by compressing activations during the forward pass, which is particularly beneficial for training large language models. By storing low-rank, compressed activations, CompAct reduces the memory required for the compute graph, leading to significant memory savings (25-30% for pretraining and 50% for fine-tuning). This method is hardware-efficient and scales well with larger models, making it a valuable approach for improving memory efficiency during training.\n\n## Memory Compression Techniques and Efficient Architectures\nThe challenges in attention mechanisms, such as quadratic memory and computational complexity, can be mitigated using various strategies. Techniques like sparse attention mechanisms, memory compression (e.g., quantization and pruning), and efficient architectures (e.g., Linformer, Performer) are discussed. Additionally, methods like FlashAttention, which uses tiling and recomputation to reduce memory usage and computational complexity, are highlighted as effective solutions for improving efficiency.\n\n## Prompt Compression and Attention Optimization\nPrompt compression techniques can also contribute to memory efficiency and attention optimization. Soft prompt methods reduce the input length by compressing key information into a smaller set of tokens, limiting attention to these compressed tokens and reducing computational costs. Comparing these methods with traditional attention optimization techniques, such as sliding window attention and sparse attention, can provide insights into their relative efficiencies and scalability.\n\n### Key Insights\n\n- **Dynamic Sparse Attention**: CASAK-V's dynamic sparse attention mechanism effectively captures necessary information for language modeling while reducing memory usage.\n- **Compressed Activations**: CompAct's compression of activations during the forward pass significantly reduces peak memory utilization, making it suitable for large model training.\n- **Efficient Architectures**: Techniques like FlashAttention and alternative architectures (Linformer, Performer) help in reducing memory and computational complexity.\n- **Prompt Compression**: Soft prompt methods can optimize attention by compressing input lengths, reducing the need for full input attention during generation.\n\n### Practical Implementations\n\n- **Hardware-Aware Design**: CompAct and FlashAttention are designed with hardware efficiency in mind, reducing memory usage and leveraging GPU capabilities effectively.\n- **Adaptive Compression**: CASAK-V's adaptive KV-cache compression and CompAct's low-rank compression methods are adaptive and can be tailored to different layers and attention heads, enhancing their practicality.\n- **Efficient Memory Access**: Techniques like product keys and attention sinks help in efficient memory access and management, which is crucial for handling long sequences and improving overall model performance[Analysis Note].\n\nThese findings and techniques can help researchers improve autoregressive language model design by enhancing memory efficiency, optimizing attention mechanisms, and ensuring practical and hardware-efficient implementations.\n",

Linearizing Large Language Models (Avg.

However, their original formulation suffers from poor scaling and underperforms compute-matched transformers. Recent linear models such as RWKV and Mamba have attempted to address these shortcomings by proposing novel time-mixing and gating architectures, but pre-training large language models requires significant data and compute investments. Thus, the search for subquadratic architectures is limited by the availability of compute and quality pre-training datasets. As a cost-effective alternative to pre-training linear transformers, we propose Scalable UPtraining for Recurrent Attention (SUPRA). We present a method to uptrain existing large pre-trained transformers into Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with a modest compute budget. This allows us to leverage the strong pre-training data and performance of existing transformer LLMs, while requiring 5% of the training cost. We find that our linearization technique leads to competitive performance on standard benchmarks, but we identify persistent in-context learning and long-context modeling shortfalls for even the largest linear models.

Moreover, recent studies have shown that SSMs can match or exceed the language modeling capabilities of Transformers, making them an attractive alternative. In a controlled setting (e.g., same data), however, studies so far have only presented small scale experiments comparing SSMs to Transformers. To understand the strengths and weaknesses of these architectures at larger scales, we present a direct comparison between 8B-parameter Mamba, Mamba-2, and Transformer models trained on the same datasets of up to 3.5T tokens. We also compare these models to a hybrid architecture consisting of 43% Mamba-2, 7% attention, and 50% MLP layers (Mamba-2-Hybrid). Using a diverse set of tasks, we answer the question of whether Mamba models can match Transformers at larger training budgets. Our results show that while pure SSMs match or exceed Transformers on many tasks, they lag behind Transformers on tasks which require strong copying or in-context learning abilities (e.g., 5-shot MMLU, Phonebook) or long-context reasoning. In contrast, we find that the 8B Mamba-2-Hybrid exceeds the 8B Transformer on all 12 standard tasks we evaluated (+2.65 points on average) and is predicted to be up to 8x faster when generating tokens at inference time. To validate long-context capabilities, we provide additional experiments evaluating variants of the Mamba-2-Hybrid and Transformer extended to support 16K, 32K, and 128K sequences. On an additional 23 long-context tasks, the hybrid model continues to closely match or exceed the Transformer on average. To enable further study, we release the checkpoints as well as the code used to train our models as part of NVIDIA's Megatron-LM project.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 19/37 (Score: 0.13)*\n\n```\nIn: arXiv preprint arXiv:2312.04927 (2023).

In an AFT layer, the key and value are first combined with a set of learned position biases, the result of which is multiplied with the query in an element-wise fashion. This new operation has a memory complexity linear w.r.t. both the context size and the dimension of features, making it compatible to both large input and model sizes. We also introduce AFT-local and AFT-conv, two model variants that take advantage of the idea of locality and spatial weight sharing while maintaining global connectivity. We conduct extensive experiments on two autoregressive modeling tasks (CIFAR10 and Enwik8) as well as an image recognition task (ImageNet-1K classification). We show that AFT demonstrates competitive performance on all the benchmarks, while providing excellent efficiency at the same time.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/28 (Score: 0.11)*\n\n```\nSo, and Quoc V.

However, a lot of applications naturally make use of complex-valued signals or images, such as MRI or remote sensing. Additionally the Fourier transform of signals is complex-valued and has numerous applications. We aim to make deep learning directly applicable to these complex-valued signals without using projections into \u211d2. Thus we add to the recent developments of complex-valued neural networks by presenting building blocks to transfer the transformer architecture to the complex domain. We present multiple versions of a complex-valued Scaled Dot-Product Attention mechanism as well as a complex-valued layer normalization. We test on a classification and a sequence generation task on the MusicNet dataset and show improved robustness to overfitting while maintaining on-par performance when compared to the real-valued transformer architecture.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 20/22 (Score: 0.09)*\n\n```\n[32] J.

However, the quadratic computational complexities restrict their application in long text processing. Prior works have adopted the chunking strategy to divide long documents into chunks and stack a self-attention backbone with the recurrent structure to extract semantic representation. Such an approach disables parallelization of the attention mechanism, significantly increasing the training cost and raising hardware requirements. Revisiting the self-attention mechanism and the recurrent structure, this paper proposes a novel long-document encoding model, Recurrent Attention Network (RAN), to enable the recurrent operation of self-attention. Combining the advantages from both sides, the well-designed RAN is capable of extracting global semantics in both token-level and document-level representations, making it inherently compatible with both sequential and classification tasks, respectively. Furthermore, RAN is computationally scalable as it supports parallelization on long document processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate the long-text encoding ability of the proposed RAN model on both classification and sequential tasks, showing its potential for a wide range of applications.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 14/27 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nHinton. 2016.

LayerMerge: Neural Network Depth Compression through Layer Pruning and Merging\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression efficiency*\n\n*Jinuk Kim, Marwa El Halabi, Mingi Ji, Hyun Oh Song*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes LayerMerge, a novel depth compression method that selects which activation layers and convolution layers to remove, to achieve a desired inference speed-up while minimizing performance loss.\n\n**Abstract:** Recent works show that reducing the number of layers in a convolutional neural network can enhance efficiency while maintaining the performance of the network. Existing depth compression methods remove redundant non-linear activation functions and merge the consecutive convolution layers into a single layer. However, these methods suffer from a critical drawback; the kernel size of the merged layers becomes larger, significantly undermining the latency reduction gained from reducing the depth of the network. We show that this problem can be addressed by jointly pruning convolution layers and activation functions. To this end, we propose LayerMerge, a novel depth compression method that selects which activation layers and convolution layers to remove, to achieve a desired inference speed-up while minimizing performance loss. Since the corresponding selection problem involves an exponential search space, we formulate a novel surrogate optimization problem and efficiently solve it via dynamic programming. Empirical results demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing depth compression and layer pruning methods on various network architectures, both on image classification and generation tasks.

DepthShrinker: A New Compression Paradigm Towards Boosting Real-Hardware Efficiency of Compact Neural Networks\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression efficiency*\n\n*Y. Fu, Haichuan Yang, Jiayi Yuan, Meng Li, Cheng Wan, Raghuraman Krishnamoorthi, Vikas Chandra, Yingyan Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work opens up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy, and proposes a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient Dnns that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real- hardware efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Efficient deep neural network (DNN) models equipped with compact operators (e.g., depthwise convolutions) have shown great potential in reducing DNNs' theoretical complexity (e.g., the total number of weights/operations) while maintaining a decent model accuracy. However, existing efficient DNNs are still limited in fulfilling their promise in boosting real-hardware efficiency, due to their commonly adopted compact operators' low hardware utilization. In this work, we open up a new compression paradigm for developing real-hardware efficient DNNs, leading to boosted hardware efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. Interestingly, we observe that while some DNN layers' activation functions help DNNs' training optimization and achievable accuracy, they can be properly removed after training without compromising the model accuracy. Inspired by this observation, we propose a framework dubbed DepthShrinker, which develops hardware-friendly compact networks via shrinking the basic building blocks of existing efficient DNNs that feature irregular computation patterns into dense ones with much improved hardware utilization and thus real-hardware efficiency. Excitingly, our DepthShrinker framework delivers hardware-friendly compact networks that outperform both state-of-the-art efficient DNNs and compression techniques, e.g., a 3.06% higher accuracy and 1.53$\\times$ throughput on Tesla V100 over SOTA channel-wise pruning method MetaPruning.

Transformers have a mostly uniform backbone where layers alternate between feed-forward and self-attention in order to build a deep network. Here we investigate this design choice and find that more complex blocks that have different permutations of layer primitives can be more efficient. Using this insight, we develop a complex block, named Brainformer, that consists of a diverse sets of layers such as sparsely gated feed-forward layers, dense feed-forward layers, attention layers, and various forms of layer normalization and activation functions. Brainformer consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art dense and sparse Transformers, in terms of both quality and efficiency. A Brainformer model with 8 billion activated parameters per token demonstrates 2x faster training convergence and 5x faster step time compared to its GLaM counterpart. In downstream task evaluation, Brainformer also demonstrates a 3% higher SuperGLUE score with fine-tuning compared to GLaM with a similar number of activated parameters. Finally, Brainformer largely outperforms a Primer dense model derived with NAS with similar computation per token on fewshot evaluations.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 19  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 4. Low-Variance Gradient Estimation in Unrolled Computation Graphs with ES-Single\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation RMSNorm*\n\n*Paul Vicol, Zico Kolter, Kevin Swersky*\n\n**TL;DR:** ES-Single is unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and it is demonstrated empirically that its variance can be substantially lower than that of PES.\n\n**Abstract:** We propose an evolution strategies-based algorithm for estimating gradients in unrolled computation graphs, called ES-Single. Similarly to the recently-proposed Persistent Evolution Strategies (PES), ES-Single is unbiased, and overcomes chaos arising from recursive function applications by smoothing the meta-loss landscape. ES-Single samples a single perturbation per particle, that is kept fixed over the course of an inner problem (e.g., perturbations are not re-sampled for each partial unroll). Compared to PES, ES-Single is simpler to implement and has lower variance: the variance of ES-Single is constant with respect to the number of truncated unrolls, removing a key barrier in applying ES to long inner problems using short truncations. We show that ES-Single is unbiased for quadratic inner problems, and demonstrate empirically that its variance can be substantially lower than that of PES. ES-Single consistently outperforms PES on a variety of tasks, including a synthetic benchmark task, hyperparameter optimization, training recurrent neural networks, and training learned optimizers.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 6  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5. Enabling First-Order Gradient-Based Learning for Equilibrium Computation in Markets\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation RMSNorm*\n\n*Nils Kohring, Fabian R. Pieroth, M. Bichler*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a novel smoothing technique that creates a surrogate market game, in which first-order methods can be applied, and theoretically and empirically outperforms zeroth- order methods in approximation quality and computational efficiency.\n\n**Abstract:** Understanding and analyzing markets is crucial, yet analytical equilibrium solutions remain largely infeasible. Recent breakthroughs in equilibrium computation rely on zeroth-order policy gradient estimation. These approaches commonly suffer from high variance and are computationally expensive. The use of fully differentiable simulators would enable more efficient gradient estimation. However, the discrete allocation of goods in economic simulations is a non-differentiable operation. This renders the first-order Monte Carlo gradient estimator inapplicable and the learning feedback systematically misleading. We propose a novel smoothing technique that creates a surrogate market game, in which first-order methods can be applied. We provide theoretical bounds on the resulting bias which justifies solving the smoothed game instead. These bounds also allow choosing the smoothing strength a priori such that the resulting estimate has low variance. Furthermore, we validate our approach via numerous empirical experiments. Our method theoretically and empirically outperforms zeroth-order methods in approximation quality and computational efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 5  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6. Understanding Gradient Regularization in Deep Learning: Efficient Finite-Difference Computation and Implicit Bias\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation RMSNorm*\n\n*Ryo Karakida, Tomoumi Takase, Tomohiro Hayase, Kazuki Osawa*\n\n**TL;DR:** This study reveals that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR and shows that the finite-Difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance.\n\n**Abstract:** Gradient regularization (GR) is a method that penalizes the gradient norm of the training loss during training. While some studies have reported that GR can improve generalization performance, little attention has been paid to it from the algorithmic perspective, that is, the algorithms of GR that efficiently improve the performance. In this study, we first reveal that a specific finite-difference computation, composed of both gradient ascent and descent steps, reduces the computational cost of GR. Next, we show that the finite-difference computation also works better in the sense of generalization performance. We theoretically analyze a solvable model, a diagonal linear network, and clarify that GR has a desirable implicit bias to so-called rich regime and finite-difference computation strengthens this bias. Furthermore, finite-difference GR is closely related to some other algorithms based on iterative ascent and descent steps for exploring flat minima. In particular, we reveal that the flooding method can perform finite-difference GR in an implicit way. Thus, this work broadens our understanding of GR for both practice and theory.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 11  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 7. MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 9. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 4 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. SoundStream: An End-to-End Neural Audio Codec\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression efficiency*\n\n*Marco Tagliasacchi, Jan Skoglund, Ahmed Omran, Alejandro Luebs, Neil Zeghidour*\n\n**Abstract:** We present SoundStream, a novel neural audio codec that can efficiently compress speech, music and general audio at bitrates normally targeted by speech-tailored codecs. SoundStream relies on a model architecture composed by a fully convolutional encoder/decoder network and a residual vector quantizer, which are trained jointly end-to-end. Training leverages recent advances in text-to-speech and speech enhancement, which combine adversarial and reconstruction losses to allow the generation of high-quality audio content from quantized embeddings. By training with structured dropout applied to quantizer layers, a single model can operate across variable bitrates from 3kbps to 18kbps, with a negligible quality loss when compared with models trained at fixed bitrates. In addition, the model is amenable to a low latency implementation, which supports streamable inference and runs in real time on a smartphone CPU. In subjective evaluations using audio at 24kHz sampling rate, SoundStream at 3kbps outperforms Opus at 12kbps and approaches EVS at 9.6kbps. Moreover, we are able to perform joint compression and enhancement either at the encoder or at the decoder side with no additional latency, which we demonstrate through background noise suppression for speech.\n\n**Published:** 2021-07-07\n\n\n\n#### 2.

Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Mark D. McDonnell*\n\n**Abstract:** For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should\nideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually\nincrease when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements\nin error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks\ndeployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We\nalso considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test\nresults of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error\nrates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our\nerror-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that\noverfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning\nbatch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full\nprecision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate\nschedule, we found that training for 1-bit-per-weight is just as fast as\nfull-precision networks, with better accuracy than standard schedules, and\nachieved about 98%-99% of peak performance in just 62 training epochs for\nCIFAR-10/100.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models. The code is accessible at https://github.com/OpenLMLab/LOMO.\n\n**Published:** 2023-10-16\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To address the researcher's goals and questions regarding normalization layer compression, efficient gradient computation, hardware-efficient implementations, memory access patterns, and the theoretical analysis of compression effects, here are some relevant findings and suggestions:\n\n## Compression Techniques for Normalization Layers\n\n- The paper on \"CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\" discusses a method that, while not exclusively focused on normalization layers, does involve compressing activations which can be applied to normalization layers. It uses low-rank compression of activations, which can be extended to the context of normalization layers to reduce memory usage.\n\n## Efficient Gradient Computation in Normalization Layers\n\n- The \"CompAct\" method also touches on efficient gradient computation by compressing the gradients within a reduced subspace. This approach maintains the full forward pass but computes the gradients with respect to the weights in a smaller subspace, which can be beneficial for normalization layers.\n\n- The discussion on \"ShortGPT\" and other model compression techniques mentions the importance of maintaining the model's functionality while reducing its size. For normalization layers, this could involve structured pruning methods that selectively remove non-critical parameters, ensuring that gradient computations remain efficient and accurate.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Layer Normalization\n\n- The \"CompAct\" paper highlights the importance of hardware-aware designs. For layer normalization, using techniques like low-rank compression and efficient projection matrices can be hardware-efficient. Specifically, the use of projection matrices to map inputs to a lower-dimensional subspace can be optimized for hardware to reduce computational costs.\n\n- The analysis note mentions the importance of IO-aware algorithms and hardware-specific optimizations. For instance, \"FlashAttention\" demonstrates how tiling strategies can reduce memory reads/writes, a principle that can be applied to optimize layer normalization on hardware[Analysis Note].\n\n## Memory Access Patterns and Cache Optimization for Normalization\n\n- The \"CompAct\" method emphasizes the reduction of memory usage during training by compressing activations and gradients. This approach inherently optimizes memory access patterns by reducing the size of the data that needs to be accessed, which is crucial for cache-friendly design.\n\n- The analysis note highlights the importance of tiling and blocking strategies to reduce memory access. These strategies can be applied to normalization layers to ensure cache-friendly memory patterns, significantly impacting performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Compression Effects on Normalization Stability\n\n- Theoretical analysis on the stability of normalization layers under compression is not explicitly covered in the provided sources, but it can be inferred from the discussions on model compression and its trade-offs. For instance, the \"ShortGPT\" paper discusses how different compression methods (like quantization and pruning) affect model performance and stability. A similar analysis would be necessary to understand the impact of compression on normalization layer stability.\n\n- The \"CompAct\" paper provides insights into how low-rank compression affects the training process and model performance. It shows that with careful design, compression can be achieved with minimal impact on training throughput and performance, which can be a starting point for analyzing the stability of normalization layers under compression.\n\nTo further address the researcher's goals, additional research into the following areas would be beneficial:\n\n- **Specific Normalization Layer Compression Techniques**: Investigate methods specifically tailored for compressing normalization layers, such as applying low-rank approximations or structured pruning.\n- **Impact of Compression on Gradient Computation**: Analyze how different compression techniques affect the accuracy and efficiency of gradient computations in normalization layers.\n- **Hardware-Efficient Implementations**: Explore hardware-specific optimizations for normalization layers, including IO-aware designs and cache-friendly memory access patterns.\n- **Theoretical Analysis**: Conduct a detailed theoretical analysis on how compression affects the stability and performance of normalization layers in autoregressive language models.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.61)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.39)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.39)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

Fu, Hermann Kumbong, Eric N. D. Nguyen, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** arXiv.org (2023)\t**Cited by** 14  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n**TL;DR:** Partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n**Abstract:** Convolution models with long filters have demonstrated state-of-the-art reasoning abilities in many long-sequence tasks but lag behind the most optimized Transformers in wall-clock time. A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.16)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/19 (Score: 0.06)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1811.02084, 2018.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 13/24 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1609.07843, 2016.

However, their undeniable qualities are counterbalanced by the fundamental limitations of handmade representations. In this work we show that we can train a single learnable frontend that outperforms mel-filterbanks on a wide range of audio signals, including speech, music, audio events and animal sounds, providing a general-purpose learned frontend for audio classification. To do so, we introduce a new principled, lightweight, fully learnable architecture that can be used as a drop-in replacement of mel-filterbanks. Our system learns all operations of audio features extraction, from filtering to pooling, compression and normalization, and can be integrated into any neural network at a negligible parameter cost. We perform multi-task training on eight diverse audio classification tasks, and show consistent improvements of our model over mel-filterbanks and previous learnable alternatives. Moreover, our system outperforms the current state-of-the-art learnable frontend on Audioset, with orders of magnitude fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 123  (*Influential: 29*)\n\n#### 2. Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression normalization*\n\n*Yulun Zhang, Huan Wang, Can Qin, Y. Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity, is proposed and applied to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) networks have obtained promising re-sults with moderate model size. Many SR methods have focused on designing lightweight architectures, which neglect to further reduce the redundancy of network parameters. On the other hand, model compression techniques, like neural architecture search and knowledge distillation, typically consume considerable memory and computation resources. In contrast, network pruning is a cheap and effective model compression technique. However, it is hard to be applied to SR networks directly, because \ufb01lter pruning for residual blocks is well-known tricky. To address the above issues, we propose aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity. To align the pruned \ufb01lter locations across different layers, we propose a sparsity structure alignment penalty term, which minimizes the norm of soft mask gram matrix. We apply aligned structured sparsity learning strategy to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network, named as ASSLN, with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods. We conduct extensive comparisons with lightweight SR networks. Our ASSLN achieves superior performance gains over recent methods quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 260  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. Learning with Auxiliary Activation for Memory-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Sunghyeon Woo, Dongsuk Jeon*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation, and combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation.\n\n**Abstract:** While deep learning has achieved great success in various fields, a large amount of memory is necessary to train deep neural networks, which hinders the development of massive state-of-the-art models. The reason is the conventional learning rule, backpropagation, should temporarily store input activations of all the layers in the network. To overcome this, recent studies suggested various memory-efficient implementations of backpropagation. However, those approaches incur computational overhead due to the recomputation of activations, slowing down neural network training. In this work, we propose a new learning rule which significantly reduces memory requirements while closely matching the performance of backpropagation. The algorithm combines auxiliary activation with output activation during forward propagation, while only auxiliary activation is used during backward propagation instead of actual input activation to reduce the amount of data to be temporarily stored. We mathematically show that our learning rule can reliably train the networks if the auxiliary activation satisfies certain conditions. Based on this observation, we suggest candidates of auxiliary activation that satisfy those conditions. Experimental results confirm that the proposed learning rule achieves competitive performance compared to backpropagation in various models such as ResNet, Transformer, BERT, ViT, and MLP-Mixer.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 1  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 5.

DIVISION: Memory Efficient Training via Dual Activation Precision\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Guanchu Wang, Zirui Liu, Zhimeng Jiang, Ninghao Liu, Nannan Zou, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision during the training, which can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation.\n\n**Abstract:** Activation compressed training provides a solution towards reducing the memory cost of training deep neural networks~(DNNs). However, state-of-the-art work combines a search of quantization bit-width with the training, which makes the procedure complicated and less transparent. To this end, we propose a simple and effective method to compress DNN training. Our method is motivated by an instructive observation: DNN backward propagation mainly utilizes the low-frequency component (LFC) of the activation maps, while the majority of memory is for caching the high-frequency component (HFC) during the training. This indicates the HFC of activation maps is highly redundant and compressible during DNN training, which inspires our proposed Dual Activation Precision (DIVISION). During the training, DIVISION preserves the high-precision copy of LFC and compresses the HFC into a light-weight copy with low numerical precision. This can significantly reduce the memory cost without negatively affecting the precision of backward propagation such that DIVISION maintains competitive model accuracy. Experiment results show DIVISION has better comprehensive performance than state-of-the-art methods, including over 10x compression of activation maps and competitive training throughput, without loss of model accuracy.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n### 3 related papers from ArXiv\n\n#### 1. Meta-StyleSpeech : Multi-Speaker Adaptive Text-to-Speech Generation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Dongchan Min, Dong Bok Lee, Eunho Yang, Sung Ju Hwang*\n\n**Abstract:** With rapid progress in neural text-to-speech (TTS) models, personalized\nspeech generation is now in high demand for many applications. For practical\napplicability, a TTS model should generate high-quality speech with only a few\naudio samples from the given speaker, that are also short in length. However,\nexisting methods either require to fine-tune the model or achieve low\nadaptation quality without fine-tuning. In this work, we propose StyleSpeech, a\nnew TTS model which not only synthesizes high-quality speech but also\neffectively adapts to new speakers. Specifically, we propose Style-Adaptive\nLayer Normalization (SALN) which aligns gain and bias of the text input\naccording to the style extracted from a reference speech audio. With SALN, our\nmodel effectively synthesizes speech in the style of the target speaker even\nfrom single speech audio. Furthermore, to enhance StyleSpeech's adaptation to\nspeech from new speakers, we extend it to Meta-StyleSpeech by introducing two\ndiscriminators trained with style prototypes, and performing episodic training.\nThe experimental results show that our models generate high-quality speech\nwhich accurately follows the speaker's voice with single short-duration (1-3\nsec) speech audio, significantly outperforming baselines.\n\n**Published:** 2021-06-06T15:34:11Z  (*Updated: 2021-06-16T16:57:10Z*)\n\n\n\n#### 2. PaReprop: Fast Parallelized Reversible Backpropagation\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Tyler Zhu, Karttikeya Mangalam*\n\n**Abstract:** The growing size of datasets and deep learning models has made faster and\nmemory-efficient training crucial. Reversible transformers have recently been\nintroduced as an exciting new method for extremely memory-efficient training,\nbut they come with an additional computation overhead of activation\nre-computation in the backpropagation phase. We present PaReprop, a fast\nParallelized Reversible Backpropagation algorithm that parallelizes the\nadditional activation re-computation overhead in reversible training with the\ngradient computation itself in backpropagation phase. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed PaReprop algorithm through extensive benchmarking\nacross model families (ViT, MViT, Swin and RoBERTa), data modalities (Vision &\nNLP), model sizes (from small to giant), and training batch sizes. Our\nempirical results show that PaReprop achieves up to 20% higher training\nthroughput than vanilla reversible training, largely mitigating the theoretical\noverhead of 25% lower throughput from activation recomputation in reversible\ntraining.

Efficient Fine-Tuning of BERT Models on the Edge\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Danilo Vucetic, Mohammadreza Tayaranian, Maryam Ziaeefard, James J. Clark, Brett H. Meyer, Warren J. Gross*\n\n**Abstract:** Resource-constrained devices are increasingly the deployment targets of\nmachine learning applications. Static models, however, do not always suffice\nfor dynamic environments. On-device training of models allows for quick\nadaptability to new scenarios. With the increasing size of deep neural\nnetworks, as noted with the likes of BERT and other natural language processing\nmodels, comes increased resource requirements, namely memory, computation,\nenergy, and time. Furthermore, training is far more resource intensive than\ninference. Resource-constrained on-device learning is thus doubly difficult,\nespecially with large BERT-like models. By reducing the memory usage of\nfine-tuning, pre-trained BERT models can become efficient enough to fine-tune\non resource-constrained devices. We propose Freeze And Reconfigure (FAR), a\nmemory-efficient training regime for BERT-like models that reduces the memory\nusage of activation maps during fine-tuning by avoiding unnecessary parameter\nupdates. FAR reduces fine-tuning time on the DistilBERT model and CoLA dataset\nby 30%, and time spent on memory operations by 47%. More broadly, reductions in\nmetric performance on the GLUE and SQuAD datasets are around 1% on average.\n\n**Published:** 2022-05-03T14:51:53Z  (*Updated: 2022-05-03T14:51:53Z*)\n\n\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Image Compression with Recurrent Neural Network and Generalized Divisive Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: neural network compression normalization*\n\n*Hyeonjoon Moon, Sujin Lee, L. Minh Dang, Khawar Islam*\n\n**Abstract:** Image compression is a method to remove spatial redundancy between adjacent pixels and reconstruct a high-quality image. In the past few years, deep learning has gained huge attention from the research community and produced promising image reconstruction results. Therefore, recent methods focused on developing deeper and more complex networks, which significantly increased network complexity. In this paper, two effective novel blocks are developed: analysis and synthesis block that employs the convolution layer and Generalized Divisive Normalization (GDN) in the variable-rate encoder and decoder side. Our network utilizes a pixel RNN approach for quantization. Furthermore, to improve the whole network, we encode a residual image using LSTM cells to reduce unnecessary information. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed variable-rate framework with novel blocks outperforms existing methods and standard image codecs, such as George's ~\\cite{002} and JPEG in terms of image similarity.

U-GAT-IT: Unsupervised Generative Attentional Networks with Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization for Image-to-Image Translation\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Junho Kim, Kwanghee Lee, Hyeonwoo Kang, Minjae Kim*\n\n**Abstract:** We propose a novel method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, which incorporates a new attention module and a new learnable normalization function in an end-to-end manner. The attention module guides our model to focus on more important regions distinguishing between source and target domains based on the attention map obtained by the auxiliary classifier. Unlike previous attention-based method which cannot handle the geometric changes between domains, our model can translate both images requiring holistic changes and images requiring large shape changes. Moreover, our new AdaLIN (Adaptive Layer-Instance Normalization) function helps our attention-guided model to flexibly control the amount of change in shape and texture by learned parameters depending on datasets. Experimental results show the superiority of the proposed method compared to the existing state-of-the-art models with a fixed network architecture and hyper-parameters.

LaPE: Layer-adaptive Position Embedding for Vision Transformers with Independent Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: adaptive layer normalization*\n\n*Jie Chen, Xiangyang Ji, Haoyi Duan, Chang Liu, Kehan Li, Yinhuai Wang, Zhennan Wang, Runyi Yu*\n\n**Abstract:**     Position information is critical for Vision Transformers (VTs) due to the permutation-invariance of self-attention operations. A typical way to introduce position information is adding the absolute Position Embedding (PE) to patch embedding before entering VTs. However, this approach operates the same Layer Normalization (LN) to token embedding and PE, and delivers the same PE to each layer. This results in restricted and monotonic PE across layers, as the shared LN affine parameters are not dedicated to PE, and the PE cannot be adjusted on a per-layer basis. To overcome these limitations, we propose using two independent LNs for token embeddings and PE in each layer, and progressively delivering PE across layers. By implementing this approach, VTs will receive layer-adaptive and hierarchical PE. We name our method as Layer-adaptive Position Embedding, abbreviated as LaPE, which is simple, effective, and robust. Extensive experiments on image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation demonstrate that LaPE significantly outperforms the default PE method. For example, LaPE improves +1.06% for CCT on CIFAR100, +1.57% for DeiT-Ti on ImageNet-1K, +0.7 box AP and +0.5 mask AP for ViT-Adapter-Ti on COCO, and +1.37 mIoU for tiny Segmenter on ADE20K. This is remarkable considering LaPE only increases negligible parameters, memory, and computational cost.    \n\n**Proceeding:** iccv-2023-1\n\n**Published:** 2023-01-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. GaLore: Memory-Efficient LLM Training by Gradient Low-Rank Projection\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Yuandong Tian, Anima Anandkumar, Zhangyang Wang, Beidi Chen, Zhenyu Zhang, Jiawei Zhao*\n\n**Abstract:** Training Large Language Models (LLMs) presents significant memory challenges, predominantly due to the growing size of weights and optimizer states. Common memory-reduction approaches, such as low-rank adaptation (LoRA), add a trainable low-rank matrix to the frozen pre-trained weight in each layer, reducing trainable parameters and optimizer states. However, such approaches typically underperform training with full-rank weights in both pre-training and fine-tuning stages since they limit the parameter search to a low-rank subspace and alter the training dynamics, and further, may require full-rank warm start. In this work, we propose Gradient Low-Rank Projection (GaLore), a training strategy that allows full-parameter learning but is more memory-efficient than common low-rank adaptation methods such as LoRA. Our approach reduces memory usage by up to 65.5% in optimizer states while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pre-training on LLaMA 1B and 7B architectures with C4 dataset with up to 19.7B tokens, and on fine-tuning RoBERTa on GLUE tasks. Our 8-bit GaLore further reduces optimizer memory by up to 82.5% and total training memory by 63.3%, compared to a BF16 baseline. Notably, we demonstrate, for the first time, the feasibility of pre-training a 7B model on consumer GPUs with 24GB memory (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 4090) without model parallel, checkpointing, or offloading strategies.\n\n**Published:** 2024-03-06\n\n\n\n#### 6. H3T: Efficient Integration of Memory Optimization and Parallelism for Large-scale Transformer Training\n\n*From Search Query: memory efficient training*\n\n*Anonymous*\n\n**Abstract:** In recent years, big models based on Transformers have achieved state-of-the-art performance on many artificial intelligence (AI) tasks.\nDespite the success of these Transformer-based models, their huge parameter size poses a serious challenge to their training, both from the storage and computation perspectives.\nTo this end, memory optimization (e.g., rematerialization and offloading) and parallelism (e.g., data parallelism and model parallelism) are widely explored to make training Transformers more efficient.\nIn this paper, we propose a framework to automatically find an efficient integration of memory optimization and parallelism for High-Throughput Transformer Training (named H3T), which is rarely considered by existing efforts for training big Transformer-based models.\nSpecifically, we design search algorithms to combine appropriate memory optimization strategies and parallelism schemes to achieve a balance between memory overhead and training efficiency.\nWe implement H3T based on an open-source toolkit BMTrain and then use H3T to train the Transformers of different sizes to evaluate the efficiency of H3T.\nThe experimental results show that H3T outperforms the most popular deep learning (DL) toolkit Megatron-DeepSpeed by $1.2\\times \\sim 4.3\\times$ training speed while reducing $34.6\\% \\sim 80.5\\%$ of memory overhead.\nMoreover, H3T can use only 64 NVIDIA A100 GPUs to train GPT-3-175B, which is very difficult for existing DL toolkits.

The paper on Neural Normalized Compression Distance (Neural NCD) discusses how large language models (LLMs) can be turned into lossless compressors using arithmetic coding, which is a method that could be applied to compress activations efficiently.\n- Another approach to compression involves using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to prune structural components of LLMs, such as attention heads, neurons, and layers. This method aims to balance performance and efficiency, which could indirectly impact the compression of activations by reducing the overall model size.\n\n## Adaptive Normalization Methods\n\n- Adaptive normalization methods that adjust based on input characteristics are not explicitly discussed in the provided sources, but the concept of dynamic adjustment can be inferred from the use of neural compressors. For instance, neural compressors using LLMs and arithmetic coding adapt to the input sequence by generating probability distributions for each symbol, which can be seen as a form of adaptive processing.\n- However, for a more direct approach to adaptive normalization, researchers might need to look into other literature that specifically focuses on input-dependent normalization strategies, such as layer normalization techniques that adapt to the input data.\n\n## Memory-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- Memory efficiency in neural networks can be improved through various techniques. The paper on LLM compression with NAS discusses efficient super-network training strategies that can help in reducing the memory footprint by identifying sparse sub-networks. This approach can be extended to optimize memory access patterns for normalization layers.\n- The work on improved JPEG lossless compression for intermediate layers in neural networks, although focused on image processing, suggests using compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques to reduce memory access and improve efficiency. Similar CIM techniques could be explored for normalization layers in language models.\n\n## Hardware Optimization Techniques for Neural Network Training\n\n- Hardware optimization for neural network training involves efficient use of resources such as memory and computational power. The NAS approach mentioned earlier includes strategies to allocate more compute to promising sub-networks, which can be optimized for hardware efficiency.\n- The paper on improved JPEG lossless compression also discusses hardware evaluation, including compression throughput, energy efficiency, and compression gate count, which are relevant considerations for optimizing hardware for neural network training.\n\n## Cache-Friendly Neural Network Architectures\n\n- Cache-friendly architectures are crucial for efficient training. The NAS method and the use of CIM techniques can help in optimizing cache utilization. For instance, by pruning unnecessary components and optimizing the structure of the model, cache access patterns can be improved.\n- Additionally, the design of the super-network and the sampling strategy during training can be optimized to ensure that the model's components are accessed efficiently, reducing cache misses and improving overall performance.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n\n- **Impact on Training Stability and Convergence**: When applying compression techniques to activations, it is crucial to evaluate the impact on training stability and convergence. The Neural NCD paper highlights that better compression rates do not always translate to better predictive performance, which suggests a need for careful evaluation of these trade-offs.\n- **Adaptive Normalization Overhead**: Assessing the computational overhead of adaptive normalization methods is essential. While these methods can offer dynamic adjustments, they may introduce additional computational costs that need to be balanced against the benefits of improved performance and memory efficiency.\n- **Hardware-Aware Design**: Ensuring that the design is hardware-aware involves optimizing memory access patterns, cache utilization, and parallel computation strategies. The use of NAS and CIM techniques can help in achieving these goals.\n\nBy integrating these insights, researchers can develop an autoregressive language model that is not only more efficient in terms of memory and computation but also maintains or improves performance through adaptive normalization and optimized hardware utilization.\n",

However, it is prohibitively expensive to scale them to long sequences such as long documents or high-resolution images, because self-attention mechanism has quadratic time and memory complexities with respect to the input sequence length. In this paper, we propose Long-Short Transformer (Transformer-LS), an efficient self-attention mechanism for modeling long sequences with linear complexity for both language and vision tasks. It aggregates a novel long-range attention with dynamic projection to model distant correlations and a short-term attention to capture fine-grained local correlations. We propose a dual normalization strategy to account for the scale mismatch between the two attention mechanisms. Transformer-LS can be applied to both autoregressive and bidirectional models without additional complexity. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art models on multiple tasks in language and vision domains, including the Long Range Arena benchmark, autoregressive language modeling, and ImageNet classification. For instance, Transformer-LS achieves 0.97 test BPC on enwik8 using half the number of parameters than previous method, while being faster and is able to handle 3x as long sequences compared to its full-attention version on the same hardware. On ImageNet, it can obtain the state-of-the-art results (e.g., a moderate size of 55.8M model solely trained on 224x224 ImageNet-1K can obtain Top-1 accuracy 84.1%), while being more scalable on high-resolution images.

To tackle this problem, we propose position coupling, a simple yet effective method that directly embeds the structure of the tasks into the positional encoding of a (decoder-only) Transformer. Taking a departure from the vanilla absolute position mechanism assigning unique position IDs to each of the tokens, we assign the same position IDs to two or more\"relevant\"tokens; for integer addition tasks, we regard digits of the same significance as in the same position. On the empirical side, we show that with the proposed position coupling, a small (1-layer) Transformer trained on 1 to 30-digit additions can generalize up to 200-digit additions (6.67x of the trained length). On the theoretical side, we prove that a 1-layer Transformer with coupled positions can solve the addition task involving exponentially many digits, whereas any 1-layer Transformer without positional information cannot entirely solve it. We also demonstrate that position coupling can be applied to other algorithmic tasks such as addition with multiple summands, Nx2 multiplication, copy/reverse, and a two-dimensional task.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 21/67 (Score: 0.83)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:2404.00560, 2024. 8\nRuibin Xiong, Yunchang Yang, Di He, Kai Zheng, Shuxin Zheng, Chen Xing, Huishuai Zhang, Yanyan Lan, Liwei Wang, and Tieyan Liu.

Fu, Stefano Ermon, A. Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.63)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Aligned Structured Sparsity Learning for Efficient Image Super-Resolution\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression techniques*\n\n*Yulun Zhang, Huan Wang, Can Qin, Y. Fu*\n\n**TL;DR:** Aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity, is proposed and applied to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods.\n\n**Abstract:** Lightweight image super-resolution (SR) networks have obtained promising re-sults with moderate model size. Many SR methods have focused on designing lightweight architectures, which neglect to further reduce the redundancy of network parameters. On the other hand, model compression techniques, like neural architecture search and knowledge distillation, typically consume considerable memory and computation resources. In contrast, network pruning is a cheap and effective model compression technique. However, it is hard to be applied to SR networks directly, because \ufb01lter pruning for residual blocks is well-known tricky. To address the above issues, we propose aligned structured sparsity learning (ASSL), which introduces a weight normalization layer and applies L 2 regularization to the scale parameters for sparsity. To align the pruned \ufb01lter locations across different layers, we propose a sparsity structure alignment penalty term, which minimizes the norm of soft mask gram matrix. We apply aligned structured sparsity learning strategy to train ef\ufb01cient image SR network, named as ASSLN, with smaller model size and lower computation than state-of-the-art methods. We conduct extensive comparisons with lightweight SR networks. Our ASSLN achieves superior performance gains over recent methods quantitatively and visually.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2021\n\n**Citations:** 42  (*Influential: 2*)\n\n#### 2.

This paper investigates a new theoretical direction for LN, regarding to its nonlinearity and representation capacity. We investigate the representation capacity of a network with layerwise composition of linear and LN transformations, referred to as LN-Net. We theoretically show that, given $m$ samples with any label assignment, an LN-Net with only 3 neurons in each layer and $O(m)$ LN layers can correctly classify them. We further show the lower bound of the VC dimension of an LN-Net. The nonlinearity of LN can be amplified by group partition, which is also theoretically demonstrated with mild assumption and empirically supported by our experiments. Based on our analyses, we consider to design neural architecture by exploiting and amplifying the nonlinearity of LN, and the effectiveness is supported by our experiments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2024\n\n**Citations:** 2  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 3. Understanding and Improving Layer Normalization\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression techniques*\n\n*Jingjing Xu, Xu Sun, Zhiyuan Zhang, Guangxiang Zhao, Junyang Lin*\n\n**TL;DR:** A new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), is proposed, by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function, and Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Abstract:** Layer normalization (LayerNorm) is a technique to normalize the distributions of intermediate layers. It enables smoother gradients, faster training, and better generalization accuracy. However, it is still unclear where the effectiveness stems from. In this paper, our main contribution is to take a step further in understanding LayerNorm. Many of previous studies believe that the success of LayerNorm comes from forward normalization. Unlike them, we find that the derivatives of the mean and variance are more important than forward normalization by re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Furthermore, we find that the parameters of LayerNorm, including the bias and gain, increase the risk of over-fitting and do not work in most cases. Experiments show that a simple version of LayerNorm (LayerNorm-simple) without the bias and gain outperforms LayerNorm on four datasets. It obtains the state-of-the-art performance on En-Vi machine translation. To address the over-fitting problem, we propose a new normalization method, Adaptive Normalization (AdaNorm), by replacing the bias and gain with a new transformation function. Experiments show that AdaNorm demonstrates better results than LayerNorm on seven out of eight datasets.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 260  (*Influential: 9*)\n\n#### 4. DoubleSqueeze: Parallel Stochastic Gradient Descent with Double-Pass Error-Compensated Compression\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation compression*\n\n*Hanlin Tang, Xiangru Lian, Tong Zhang, Ji Liu*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a detailed analysis on this two-pass communication model and its asynchronous parallel variant, with error-compensated compression both on the worker nodes and on the parameter server, and admits three very nice properties: it is compatible with an arbitrary compression technique, it admits an improved convergence rate and it admits linear speedup with respect to the number of workers.\n\n**Abstract:** A standard approach in large scale machine learning is distributed stochastic gradient training, which requires the computation of aggregated stochastic gradients over multiple nodes on a network. Communication is a major bottleneck in such applications, and in recent years, compressed stochastic gradient methods such as QSGD (quantized SGD) and sparse SGD have been proposed to reduce communication. It was also shown that error compensation can be combined with compression to achieve better convergence in a scheme that each node compresses its local stochastic gradient and broadcast the result to all other nodes over the network in a single pass. However, such a single pass broadcast approach is not realistic in many practical implementations. For example, under the popular parameter server model for distributed learning, the worker nodes need to send the compressed local gradients to the parameter server, which performs the aggregation. The parameter server has to compress the aggregated stochastic gradient again before sending it back to the worker nodes. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis on this two-pass communication model and its asynchronous parallel variant, with error-compensated compression both on the worker nodes and on the parameter server. We show that the error-compensated stochastic gradient algorithm admits three very nice properties: 1) it is compatible with an \\emph{arbitrary} compression technique; 2) it admits an improved convergence rate than the non error-compensated stochastic gradient methods such as QSGD and sparse SGD; 3) it admits linear speedup with respect to the number of workers. The empirical study is also conducted to validate our theoretical results.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2019\n\n**Citations:** 208  (*Influential: 26*)\n\n#### 5. Variance-based Gradient Compression for Efficient Distributed Deep Learning\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation compression*\n\n*Yusuke Tsuzuku, H. Imachi, Takuya Akiba*\n\n**TL;DR:** The key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated and an efficient algorithm to compute the variance with negligible additional cost is presented.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to the substantial computational cost, training state-of-the-art deep neural networks for large-scale datasets often requires distributed training using multiple computation workers. However, by nature, workers need to frequently communicate gradients, causing severe bottlenecks, especially on lower bandwidth connections. A few methods have been proposed to compress gradient for efficient communication, but they either suffer a low compression ratio or significantly harm the resulting model accuracy, particularly when applied to convolutional neural networks. To address these issues, we propose a method to reduce the communication overhead of distributed deep learning. Our key observation is that gradient updates can be delayed until an unambiguous (high amplitude, low variance) gradient has been calculated. We also present an efficient algorithm to compute the variance with negligible additional cost. We experimentally show that our method can achieve very high compression ratio while maintaining the result model accuracy. We also analyze the efficiency using computation and communication cost models and provide the evidence that this method enables distributed deep learning for many scenarios with commodity environments.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2018\n\n**Citations:** 74  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n#### 6. Gradient-Free Structured Pruning with Unlabeled Data\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation compression*\n\n*Azade Nova, H. Dai, D. Schuurmans*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data and shows that up to 40% of the original FLOP count can be reduced with less than a 4% accuracy loss across all tasks considered.\n\n**Abstract:** Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved great success in solving difficult tasks across many domains, but such success comes with a high computation cost, and inference latency. As developers and third parties customize these models, the need to provide efficient inference has increased. Many efforts have attempted to reduce inference cost through model compression techniques such as pruning and distillation. However, these techniques either require labeled data, or are time-consuming as they require the compressed model to be retrained to regain accuracy. In this paper, we propose a gradient-free structured pruning framework that uses only unlabeled data. An evaluation on the GLUE and SQuAD benchmarks using BERT$_{BASE}$ and DistilBERT illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. By only using the weights of the pre-trained model and unlabeled data, in a matter of a few minutes on a single GPU, up to 40% of the original FLOP count can be reduced with less than a 4% accuracy loss across all tasks considered.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 14  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n#### 7. MA-BERT: Towards Matrix Arithmetic-only BERT Inference by Eliminating Complex Non-Linear Functions\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Neo Wei Ming, Zhehui Wang, Cheng Liu, R. Goh, Tao Luo*\n\n**TL;DR:** MA-BERT is proposed, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss and enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs.\n\n**Abstract:** Due to their superior results, Transformer-based models such as BERT have become de facto standards in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. However, the intensive use of complex non-linear functions within the Transformer architecture impairs its computing efficiency and complicates corresponding accelerator designs, because non-linear functions are generally computation-intensive and require special hardware support. In light of this, we propose MA-BERT, which allows matrix arithmetic-only operations in Transformer-based NLP models and achieves efficient inference with negligible accuracy loss. Specifically, we propose four correlated techniques that include approximating softmax with a two-layer neural network, replacing GELU with ReLU, fusing normalization layers with adjacent linear layers, and leveraging knowledge transfer from baseline models. Through these techniques, we are able to eliminate the major non-linear functions in Transformer-based models and obtain MA-BERT with only matrix arithmetic and trivial ReLU operations without compromising on accuracy. With mainly regular matrix arithmetic operations, MA-BERT enables hardware-friendly processing on various computing engines, including CPUs and GPUs. Our experimental results show that MA-BERT achieves up to 27% and 41% reduction in inference time on CPU and GPU, respectively, with comparable accuracy on many downstream tasks compared to\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Learning Representations\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 8. Gated Linear Attention Transformers with Hardware-Efficient Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Songlin Yang, Bailin Wang, Yikang Shen, Rameswar Panda, Yoon Kim*\n\n**TL;DR:** The resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet and Mamba on moderate-scale language modeling experiments.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers with linear attention allow for efficient parallel training but can simultaneously be formulated as an RNN with 2D (matrix-valued) hidden states, thus enjoying linear-time inference complexity. However, linear attention generally underperforms ordinary softmax attention. Moreover, current implementations of linear attention lack I/O-awareness and are thus slower than highly optimized implementations of softmax attention. This work describes a hardware-efficient algorithm for linear attention that trades off memory movement against parallelizability. The resulting implementation, dubbed FLASHLINEARATTENTION, is faster than FLASHATTENTION-2 (Dao, 2023) as a standalone layer even on short sequence lengths (e.g., 1K). We then generalize this algorithm to a more expressive variant of linear attention with data-dependent gates. When used as a replacement for the standard attention layer in Transformers, the resulting gated linear attention (GLA) Transformer is found to perform competitively against the LLaMA-architecture Transformer (Touvron et al., 2023) as well recent linear-time-inference baselines such as RetNet (Sun et al., 2023a) and Mamba (Gu&Dao, 2023) on moderate-scale language modeling experiments. GLA Transformer is especially effective at length generalization, enabling a model trained on 2K to generalize to sequences longer than 20K without significant perplexity degradations. For training speed, the GLA Transformer has higher throughput than a similarly-sized Mamba model.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 69  (*Influential: 12*)\n\n#### 9. Simple Hardware-Efficient Long Convolutions for Sequence Modeling\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Daniel Y. Fu, Elliot L. Epstein, Eric N. D. Nguyen, A. Thomas, Michael Zhang, Tri Dao, A. Rudra, Christopher R\u00e9*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is found that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling.\n\n**Abstract:** State space models (SSMs) have high performance on long sequence modeling but require sophisticated initialization techniques and specialized implementations for high quality and runtime performance. We study whether a simple alternative can match SSMs in performance and efficiency: directly learning long convolutions over the sequence. We find that a key requirement to achieving high performance is keeping the convolution kernels smooth. We find that simple interventions--such as squashing the kernel weights--result in smooth kernels and recover SSM performance on a range of tasks including the long range arena, image classification, language modeling, and brain data modeling. Next, we develop FlashButterfly, an IO-aware algorithm to improve the runtime performance of long convolutions. FlashButterfly appeals to classic Butterfly decompositions of the convolution to reduce GPU memory IO and increase FLOP utilization. FlashButterfly speeds up convolutions by 2.2$\\times$, and allows us to train on Path256, a challenging task with sequence length 64K, where we set state-of-the-art by 29.1 points while training 7.2$\\times$ faster than prior work. Lastly, we introduce an extension to FlashButterfly that learns the coefficients of the Butterfly decomposition, increasing expressivity without increasing runtime. Using this extension, we outperform a Transformer on WikiText103 by 0.2 PPL with 30% fewer parameters.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 45  (*Influential: 4*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1.

Pre-RMSNorm and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformers: Equivalent and Efficient Pre-LN Transformers\n\n*From Search Query: normalization layer compression techniques*\n\n*David Z. Pan, Hanqing Zhu, Jiaqi Gu, Zixuan Jiang*\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers have achieved great success in machine learning applications. Normalization techniques, such as Layer Normalization (LayerNorm, LN) and Root Mean Square Normalization (RMSNorm), play a critical role in accelerating and stabilizing the training of Transformers. While LayerNorm recenters and rescales input vectors, RMSNorm only rescales the vectors by their RMS value. Despite being more computationally efficient, RMSNorm may compromise the representation ability of Transformers. There is currently no consensus regarding the preferred normalization technique, as some models employ LayerNorm while others utilize RMSNorm, especially in recent large language models. It is challenging to convert Transformers with one normalization to the other type. While there is an ongoing disagreement between the two normalization types, we propose a solution to unify two mainstream Transformer architectures, Pre-LN and Pre-RMSNorm Transformers. By removing the inherent redundant mean information in the main branch of Pre-LN Transformers, we can reduce LayerNorm to RMSNorm, achieving higher efficiency. We further propose the Compressed RMSNorm (CRMSNorm) and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer based on a lossless compression of the zero-mean vectors. We formally establish the equivalence of Pre-LN, Pre-RMSNorm, and Pre-CRMSNorm Transformer variants in both training and inference. It implies that Pre-LN Transformers can be substituted with Pre-(C)RMSNorm counterparts at almost no cost, offering the same arithmetic functionality along with free efficiency improvement. Experiments demonstrate that we can reduce the training and inference time of Pre-LN Transformers by 1% - 10%.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2023-11\n\n**Published:** 2023-05-24\n\n\n\n#### 3.

Quantized Training of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees\n\n*From Search Query: gradient computation compression*\n\n*Tie-Yan Liu, Shuxin Zheng, Zhuoming Chen, Guolin Ke, Yu Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed significant success in Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) for a wide range of machine learning applications. Generally, a consensus about GBDT's training algorithms is gradients and statistics are computed based on high-precision floating points. In this paper, we investigate an essentially important question which has been largely ignored by the previous literature: how many bits are needed for representing gradients in training GBDT? To solve this mystery, we propose to quantize all the high-precision gradients in a very simple yet effective way in the GBDT's training algorithm. Surprisingly, both our theoretical analysis and empirical studies show that the necessary precisions of gradients without hurting any performance can be quite low, e.g., 2 or 3 bits. With low-precision gradients, most arithmetic operations in GBDT training can be replaced by integer operations of 8, 16, or 32 bits. Promisingly, these findings may pave the way for much more efficient training of GBDT from several aspects: (1) speeding up the computation of gradient statistics in histograms; (2) compressing the communication cost of high-precision statistical information during distributed training; (3) the inspiration of utilization and development of hardware architectures which well support low-precision computation for GBDT training. Benchmarked on CPUs, GPUs, and distributed clusters, we observe up to 2$\\times$ speedup of our simple quantization strategy compared with SOTA GBDT systems on extensive datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of the low-precision training of GBDT. The code will be released to the official repository of LightGBM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-20\n\n\n\n#### 5. Training wide residual networks for deployment using a single bit for each weight\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Mark D. McDonnell*\n\n**Abstract:** For fast and energy-efficient deployment of trained deep neural networks on\nresource-constrained embedded hardware, each learned weight parameter should\nideally be represented and stored using a single bit. Error-rates usually\nincrease when this requirement is imposed. Here, we report large improvements\nin error rates on multiple datasets, for deep convolutional neural networks\ndeployed with 1-bit-per-weight. Using wide residual networks as our main\nbaseline, our approach simplifies existing methods that binarize weights by\napplying the sign function in training; we apply scaling factors for each layer\nwith constant unlearned values equal to the layer-specific standard deviations\nused for initialization. For CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet, and models with\n1-bit-per-weight requiring less than 10 MB of parameter memory, we achieve\nerror rates of 3.9%, 18.5% and 26.0% / 8.5% (Top-1 / Top-5) respectively. We\nalso considered MNIST, SVHN and ImageNet32, achieving 1-bit-per-weight test\nresults of 0.27%, 1.9%, and 41.3% / 19.1% respectively. For CIFAR, our error\nrates halve previously reported values, and are within about 1% of our\nerror-rates for the same network with full-precision weights. For networks that\noverfit, we also show significant improvements in error rate by not learning\nbatch normalization scale and offset parameters. This applies to both full\nprecision and 1-bit-per-weight networks. Using a warm-restart learning-rate\nschedule, we found that training for 1-bit-per-weight is just as fast as\nfull-precision networks, with better accuracy than standard schedules, and\nachieved about 98%-99% of peak performance in just 62 training epochs for\nCIFAR-10/100.

AdaLomo: Low-memory Optimization with Adaptive Learning Rate\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient normalization*\n\n*Xipeng Qiu, Haijun Lv, Qipeng Guo, Hang Yan, Kai Lv*\n\n**Abstract:** Large language models have achieved remarkable success, but their extensive parameter size necessitates substantial memory for training, thereby setting a high threshold. While the recently proposed low-memory optimization (LOMO) reduces memory footprint, its optimization technique, akin to stochastic gradient descent, is sensitive to hyper-parameters and exhibits suboptimal convergence, failing to match the performance of the prevailing optimizer for large language models, AdamW. Through empirical analysis of the Adam optimizer, we found that, compared to momentum, the adaptive learning rate is more critical for bridging the gap. Building on this insight, we introduce the low-memory optimization with adaptive learning rate (AdaLomo), which offers an adaptive learning rate for each parameter. To maintain memory efficiency, we employ non-negative matrix factorization for the second-order moment estimation in the optimizer state. Additionally, we suggest the use of a grouped update normalization to stabilize convergence. Our experiments with instruction-tuning and further pre-training demonstrate that AdaLomo achieves results on par with AdamW, while significantly reducing memory requirements, thereby lowering the hardware barrier to training large language models.

This configuration can offer advantages in terms of computational efficiency and stability, but it does not specifically address compression techniques for normalization layers.\n\n- **Structural Pruning**: While not specifically focused on normalization layers, structural pruning methods like those described in \"LLM Compression with Neural Architecture Search\" can be adapted to include normalization layers. These methods involve pruning structural components, including layers and attention heads, which could potentially include normalization layers.\n\n## Impact of Compression on Gradient Computation and Backpropagation\n\n- **Gradient Computation**: The effectiveness of compression techniques on gradient computation is crucial. For instance, methods like \"LLMPru\" involve structural pruning based on gradient information, which can affect the gradient computation during backpropagation. This method selectively removes non-critical structures, which might impact the stability and efficiency of gradient updates.\n\n- **Backward Pass Optimization**: Understanding the impact on the backward pass is critical. As mentioned in the analysis, derivatives of the mean and variance in layer normalization are important for re-centering and re-scaling backward gradients. Compression techniques need to ensure that these dynamics are preserved or optimized.\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Implementations of Normalization Layers\n\n- **IO-Aware Design**: Papers like \"FlashAttention\" emphasize the importance of IO-aware algorithms for memory optimization. Similar strategies can be applied to normalization layers to ensure they are cache-friendly and efficient in terms of memory access. This involves tiling and blocking strategies to reduce memory reads/writes (though not directly mentioned in the provided sources, it is a relevant concept).\n\n- **Compute-In-Memory**: The concept of compute-in-memory (CIM) techniques, as discussed in the \"Improved JPEG Lossless Compression\" paper, can be explored for normalization layers. This approach could potentially reduce the computational and memory overhead associated with normalization.\n\n## Theoretical Analysis of Compression Effects on Model Capacity\n\n- **Model Pruning and Quantization**: Theoretical analysis of model pruning and quantization techniques, as discussed in \"ShortGPT\" and \"LLM Compression with Neural Architecture Search,\" shows that these methods can significantly reduce model size and computational costs while maintaining performance. However, the trade-offs between compression ratio and model performance need careful consideration.\n\n## Integration Strategies for Compressed Normalization in Transformer Architectures\n\n- **Neural Architecture Search (NAS)**: The paper on \"LLM Compression with Neural Architecture Search\" provides a framework for integrating compressed models into transformer architectures. By using NAS to prune structural components, including normalization layers, the model can achieve a balance between performance and efficiency. This approach involves fine-tuning and selecting optimal sub-networks that include compressed normalization layers.\n\n- **Adaptive Normalization**: Adaptive normalization techniques, as hinted at in the analysis, can be integrated into transformer architectures to improve performance. This involves understanding the effectiveness of layer normalization and adapting it to maintain training stability and efficiency.\n\nIn summary, to achieve the goal of improving autoregressive language model design, researchers should focus on:\n\n- Adapting structural pruning and NAS techniques to include normalization layers.\n- Ensuring that compression techniques do not adversely affect gradient computation and backpropagation.\n- Implementing IO-aware and compute-in-memory strategies to enhance hardware efficiency.\n- Conducting thorough theoretical analysis to understand the impact of compression on model capacity.\n- Integrating compressed normalization layers into transformer architectures using NAS and adaptive normalization techniques.\n",

Rudra, Christopher R'e*\n\n**Published in:** Neural Information Processing Systems (2022)\t**Cited by** 1034  (*Influential: 98*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work proposes FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes.\n\n**Abstract:** Transformers are slow and memory-hungry on long sequences, since the time and memory complexity of self-attention are quadratic in sequence length. Approximate attention methods have attempted to address this problem by trading off model quality to reduce the compute complexity, but often do not achieve wall-clock speedup. We argue that a missing principle is making attention algorithms IO-aware -- accounting for reads and writes between levels of GPU memory. We propose FlashAttention, an IO-aware exact attention algorithm that uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM. We analyze the IO complexity of FlashAttention, showing that it requires fewer HBM accesses than standard attention, and is optimal for a range of SRAM sizes. We also extend FlashAttention to block-sparse attention, yielding an approximate attention algorithm that is faster than any existing approximate attention method. FlashAttention trains Transformers faster than existing baselines: 15% end-to-end wall-clock speedup on BERT-large (seq. length 512) compared to the MLPerf 1.1 training speed record, 3$\\times$ speedup on GPT-2 (seq. length 1K), and 2.4$\\times$ speedup on long-range arena (seq. length 1K-4K). FlashAttention and block-sparse FlashAttention enable longer context in Transformers, yielding higher quality models (0.7 better perplexity on GPT-2 and 6.4 points of lift on long-document classification) and entirely new capabilities: the first Transformers to achieve better-than-chance performance on the Path-X challenge (seq. length 16K, 61.4% accuracy) and Path-256 (seq. length 64K, 63.1% accuracy).\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 22/53 (Score: 0.58)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in neural information processing systems (NeurIPS), 2020.

Learning Fast Algorithms for Linear Transforms Using Butterfly Factorizations (Avg. Score: 0.27)\n\n*Tri Dao, Albert Gu, Matthew Eichhorn, A. Rudra, C. R\u00e9*\n\n**Published in:** International Conference on Machine Learning (2019)\t**Cited by** 84  (*Influential: 13*)\n\n**TL;DR:** This work introduces a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms, and can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations.\n\n**Abstract:** Fast linear transforms are ubiquitous in machine learning, including the discrete Fourier transform, discrete cosine transform, and other structured transformations such as convolutions. All of these transforms can be represented by dense matrix-vector multiplication, yet each has a specialized and highly efficient (subquadratic) algorithm. We ask to what extent hand-crafting these algorithms and implementations is necessary, what structural priors they encode, and how much knowledge is required to automatically learn a fast algorithm for a provided structured transform. Motivated by a characterization of fast matrix-vector multiplication as products of sparse matrices, we introduce a parameterization of divide-and-conquer methods that is capable of representing a large class of transforms. This generic formulation can automatically learn an efficient algorithm for many important transforms; for example, it recovers the O(N log N) Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm to machine precision, for dimensions N up to 1024. Furthermore, our method can be incorporated as a lightweight replacement of generic matrices in machine learning pipelines to learn efficient and compressible transformations. On a standard task of compressing a single hidden-layer network, our method exceeds the classification accuracy of unconstrained matrices on CIFAR-10 by 3.9 points-the first time a structured approach has done so-with 4\u00d7 faster inference speed and 40\u00d7 fewer parameters.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 11/35 (Score: 0.27)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, pp. 190-196, 1999.

A major bottleneck is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)--which allows long convolutions to run in $O(N logN)$ time in sequence length $N$ but has poor hardware utilization. In this paper, we study how to optimize the FFT convolution. We find two key bottlenecks: the FFT does not effectively use specialized matrix multiply units, and it incurs expensive I/O between layers of the memory hierarchy. In response, we propose FlashFFTConv. FlashFFTConv uses a matrix decomposition that computes the FFT using matrix multiply units and enables kernel fusion for long sequences, reducing I/O. We also present two sparse convolution algorithms--1) partial convolutions and 2) frequency-sparse convolutions--which can be implemented simply by skipping blocks in the matrix decomposition, enabling further opportunities for memory and compute savings. FlashFFTConv speeds up exact FFT convolutions by up to 7.93$\\times$ over PyTorch and achieves up to 4.4$\\times$ speedup end-to-end. Given the same compute budget, FlashFFTConv allows Hyena-GPT-s to achieve 2.3 points better perplexity on the PILE and M2-BERT-base to achieve 3.3 points higher GLUE score--matching models with twice the parameter count. FlashFFTConv also achieves 96.1% accuracy on Path-512, a high-resolution vision task where no model had previously achieved better than 50%. Furthermore, partial convolutions enable longer-sequence models--yielding the first DNA model that can process the longest human genes (2.3M base pairs)--and frequency-sparse convolutions speed up pretrained models while maintaining or improving model quality.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 27/46 (Score: 0.20)*\n\n```\nIn Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2022.

We introduce two techniques to improve the efficiency of Transformers. For one, we replace dot-product attention by one that uses locality-sensitive hashing, changing its complexity from O($L^2$) to O($L\\log L$), where $L$ is the length of the sequence. Furthermore, we use reversible residual layers instead of the standard residuals, which allows storing activations only once in the training process instead of $N$ times, where $N$ is the number of layers. The resulting model, the Reformer, performs on par with Transformer models while being much more memory-efficient and much faster on long sequences.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 16/19 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\nCoRR, abs/1811.02084, 2018.

In particular, the self-attention mechanism used in such models contributes significantly to these costs, which has resulted in several recent works that propose sparse attention approximations for inference. In this work, we propose to approximate the self-attention computation by focusing on the dimensionality of key vectors computed in the attention block. Our analysis reveals that the key vectors lie in a significantly lower-dimensional space, consistently across several datasets and models. Exploiting this observation, we propose Loki, a novel sparse attention method that ranks and selects tokens in the KV-cache based on attention scores computed in low-dimensional space. Our evaluations show that Loki is able to maintain the efficacy of the models better than other popular approximation methods, while speeding up the attention computation due to reduced data movement (load/store) and compute costs.\n\n##### *Relevant Chunk: No. 9/24 (Score: 0.05)*\n\n```\narXiv preprint arXiv:1904.10509, 2019.

Improving robustness against common corruptions by covariate shift adaptation\n\n*From Search Query: activation compression normalization*\n\n*Steffen Schneider, E. Rusak, L. Eck, O. Bringmann, Wieland Brendel, M. Bethge*\n\n**TL;DR:** It is argued that results with adapted statistics should be included whenever reporting scores in corruption benchmarks and other out-of-distribution generalization settings, and 32 samples are sufficient to improve the current state of the art for a ResNet-50 architecture.\n\n**Abstract:** Today's state-of-the-art machine vision models are vulnerable to image corruptions like blurring or compression artefacts, limiting their performance in many real-world applications. We here argue that popular benchmarks to measure model robustness against common corruptions (like ImageNet-C) underestimate model robustness in many (but not all) application scenarios. The key insight is that in many scenarios, multiple unlabeled examples of the corruptions are available and can be used for unsupervised online adaptation. Replacing the activation statistics estimated by batch normalization on the training set with the statistics of the corrupted images consistently improves the robustness across 25 different popular computer vision models. Using the corrected statistics, ResNet-50 reaches 62.2% mCE on ImageNet-C compared to 76.7% without adaptation. With the more robust AugMix model, we improve the state of the art from 56.5% mCE to 51.0% mCE. Even adapting to a single sample improves robustness for the ResNet-50 and AugMix models, and 32 samples are sufficient to improve the current state of the art for a ResNet-50 architecture. We argue that results with adapted statistics should be included whenever reporting scores in corruption benchmarks and other out-of-distribution generalization settings.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 403  (*Influential: 64*)\n\n#### 2. EXACT: Scalable Graph Neural Networks Training via Extreme Activation Compression\n\n*From Search Query: activation compression normalization*\n\n*Zirui Liu, Kaixiong Zhou, Fan Yang, Li Li, Rui Chen, Xia Hu*\n\n**TL;DR:** An optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch, and a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called EXACT, which for the first time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations.\n\n**Abstract:** Training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) on large graphs is a fundamental challenge due to the high memory usage, which is mainly occupied by activations (e.g., node embeddings). Previous works usually focus on reducing the number of nodes retained in memory. In parallel, unlike what has been developed for other types of neural networks, training with compressed activation maps is less explored for GNNs. This extension is notoriously dif\ufb01cult to implement due to the lack of necessary tools in common graph learning packages. To un-leash the potential of this direction, we provide an optimized GPU implementation which supports training GNNs with compressed activations. Based on the implementation, we propose a memory-ef\ufb01cient framework called \u201cEXACT\u201d, which for the \ufb01rst time demonstrates the potential and evaluates the feasibility of training GNNs with compressed activations. We systematically analyze the trade-off among the memory saving, time overhead, and accuracy drop. In practice, EXACT can reduce the memory footprint of activations by up to 32 \u00d7 with 0 . 2 - 0 . 5% accuracy drop and 10 - 25% time overhead across different models and datasets. We implement EXACT as an extension for Pytorch Geometric and Pytorch. In practice, for Pytorch Geometric, EXACT can trim down the hardware requirement of training a three-layer full-batch GraphSAGE on ogbn-products from a 48GB GPU to a 12GB GPU.

Fine-tuning Language Models over Slow Networks using Activation Compression with Guarantees\n\n*From Search Query: activation compression normalization*\n\n*Jue Wang, Binhang Yuan, Luka Rimanic, Yongjun He, Tri Dao, Beidi Chen, Christopher R\u00e9, Ce Zhang*\n\n**TL;DR:** This paper proposes AC-SGD, a novel activation compression algorithm for communication-efficient pipeline parallelism training over slow networks, and shows that it can be combined with state-of-the-art gradient compression algorithms to enable end-to-end communication compression.\n\n**Abstract:** Communication compression is a crucial technique for modern distributed learning systems to alleviate their communication bottlenecks over slower networks. Despite recent intensive studies of gradient compression for data parallel-style training, compressing the activations for models trained with pipeline parallelism is still an open problem. In this paper, we propose AC-SGD, a novel activation compression algorithm for communication-efficient pipeline parallelism training over slow networks. Different from previous efforts in activation compression, instead of compressing activation values directly, AC-SGD compresses the changes of the activations. This allows us to show, to the best of our knowledge for the first time, that one can still achieve $O(1/\\sqrt{T})$ convergence rate for non-convex objectives under activation compression, without making assumptions on gradient unbiasedness that do not hold for deep learning models with non-linear activation functions.We then show that AC-SGD can be optimized and implemented efficiently, without additional end-to-end runtime overhead.We evaluated AC-SGD to fine-tune language models with up to 1.5 billion parameters, compressing activations to 2-4 bits.AC-SGD provides up to 4.3X end-to-end speed-up in slower networks, without sacrificing model quality. Moreover, we also show that AC-SGD can be combined with state-of-the-art gradient compression algorithms to enable\"end-to-end communication compression: All communications between machines, including model gradients, forward activations, and backward gradients are compressed into lower precision.This provides up to 4.9X end-to-end speed-up, without sacrificing model quality.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 9  (*Influential: 1*)\n\n#### 4. Memorization and Optimization in Deep Neural Networks with Minimum Over-parameterization\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization neural networks*\n\n*Simone Bombari, Mohammad Hossein Amani, Marco Mondelli*\n\n**TL;DR:** A key technical contribution is a lower bound on the smallest NTK eigenvalue for deep networks with the minimum possible over-parameterization: the number of parameters is roughly $\\Omega(N)$ and, hence, theNumber of neurons is as little as $\\O omega(\\sqrt{N})$.\n\n**Abstract:** The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) has emerged as a powerful tool to provide memorization, optimization and generalization guarantees in deep neural networks. A line of work has studied the NTK spectrum for two-layer and deep networks with at least a layer with $\\Omega(N)$ neurons, $N$ being the number of training samples. Furthermore, there is increasing evidence suggesting that deep networks with sub-linear layer widths are powerful memorizers and optimizers, as long as the number of parameters exceeds the number of samples. Thus, a natural open question is whether the NTK is well conditioned in such a challenging sub-linear setup. In this paper, we answer this question in the affirmative. Our key technical contribution is a lower bound on the smallest NTK eigenvalue for deep networks with the minimum possible over-parameterization: the number of parameters is roughly $\\Omega(N)$ and, hence, the number of neurons is as little as $\\Omega(\\sqrt{N})$. To showcase the applicability of our NTK bounds, we provide two results concerning memorization capacity and optimization guarantees for gradient descent training.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2022\n\n**Citations:** 24  (*Influential: 6*)\n\n#### 5. CORNN: Convex optimization of recurrent neural networks for rapid inference of neural dynamics\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization neural networks*\n\n*Fatih Dinc, Adam Shai, Mark J. Schnitzer, Hidenori Tanaka*\n\n**TL;DR:** By training dRNNs with millions of parameters in subminute processing times on a standard computer, CORNN constitutes a first step towards real-time network reproduction constrained on large-scale neural recordings and a powerful computational tool for advancing the understanding of neural computation.\n\n**Abstract:** Advances in optical and electrophysiological recording technologies have made it possible to record the dynamics of thousands of neurons, opening up new possibilities for interpreting and controlling large neural populations in behaving animals. A promising way to extract computational principles from these large datasets is to train data-constrained recurrent neural networks (dRNNs). Performing this training in real-time could open doors for research techniques and medical applications to model and control interventions at single-cell resolution and drive desired forms of animal behavior. However, existing training algorithms for dRNNs are inefficient and have limited scalability, making it a challenge to analyze large neural recordings even in offline scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce a training method termed Convex Optimization of Recurrent Neural Networks (CORNN). In studies of simulated recordings, CORNN attained training speeds ~100-fold faster than traditional optimization approaches while maintaining or enhancing modeling accuracy. We further validated CORNN on simulations with thousands of cells that performed simple computations such as those of a 3-bit flip-flop or the execution of a timed response. Finally, we showed that CORNN can robustly reproduce network dynamics and underlying attractor structures despite mismatches between generator and inference models, severe subsampling of observed neurons, or mismatches in neural time-scales. Overall, by training dRNNs with millions of parameters in subminute processing times on a standard computer, CORNN constitutes a first step towards real-time network reproduction constrained on large-scale neural recordings and a powerful computational tool for advancing the understanding of neural computation.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 4  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 6.

We compare ERM, which uses gradient descent to optimize, and Bayesian learning with importance sampling for their generalization and computational complexity. We derive the first algorithm-dependent PAC-Bayesian generalization bound for infinitely wide networks based on an exact KL divergence between the trained posterior distribution obtained by infinitesimal step size gradient descent and a Gaussian prior. Moreover, we show how to transform gradient-based optimization into importance sampling by incorporating a weight. While Bayesian learning has better generalization, it suffers from low sampling efficiency. Optimization methods, on the other hand, have good sampling efficiency but poor generalization. Our proposed algorithm TransBL enables a trade-off between generalization and sampling efficiency.\n\n**Venue:** Neural Information Processing Systems\n\n**Year:** 2023\n\n**Citations:** 0  (*Influential: 0*)\n\n#### 7. DropIT: Dropping Intermediate Tensors for Memory-Efficient DNN Training\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Joya Chen, Kai Xu, Yifei Cheng, Angela Yao*\n\n**TL;DR:** Experiments show that DropIT can drop up to 90\\% of the intermediate tensor elements in fully-connected and convolutional layers while achieving higher testing accuracy for Visual Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on various tasks.\n\n**Abstract:** A standard hardware bottleneck when training deep neural networks is GPU memory. The bulk of memory is occupied by caching intermediate tensors for gradient computation in the backward pass. We propose a novel method to reduce this footprint - Dropping Intermediate Tensors (DropIT). DropIT drops min-k elements of the intermediate tensors and approximates gradients from the sparsified tensors in the backward pass. Theoretically, DropIT reduces noise on estimated gradients and therefore has a higher rate of convergence than vanilla-SGD. Experiments show that we can drop up to 90\\% of the intermediate tensor elements in fully-connected and convolutional layers while achieving higher testing accuracy for Visual Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on various tasks (e.g., classification, object detection, instance segmentation).

Training Binary Neural Networks using the Bayesian Learning Rule\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Xiangming Meng, Roman Bachmann, M. E. Khan*\n\n**TL;DR:** This work provides a principled approach for training binary neural networks which justifies and extends existing approaches and applies the Bayesian learning rule to estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights.\n\n**Abstract:** Neural networks with binary weights are computation-efficient and hardware-friendly, but their training is challenging because it involves a discrete optimization problem. Surprisingly, ignoring the discrete nature of the problem and using gradient-based methods, such as the Straight-Through Estimator, still works well in practice. This raises the question: are there principled approaches which justify such methods? In this paper, we propose such an approach using the Bayesian learning rule. The rule, when applied to estimate a Bernoulli distribution over the binary weights, results in an algorithm which justifies some of the algorithmic choices made by the previous approaches. The algorithm not only obtains state-of-the-art performance, but also enables uncertainty estimation for continual learning to avoid catastrophic forgetting. Our work provides a principled approach for training binary neural networks which justifies and extends existing approaches.\n\n**Venue:** International Conference on Machine Learning\n\n**Year:** 2020\n\n**Citations:** 38  (*Influential: 5*)\n\n### 6 related papers from Papers with Code\n\n#### 1. Pruning Redundant Mappings in Transformer Models via Spectral-Normalized Identity Prior\n\n*From Search Query: activation compression normalization*\n\n*Dan Roth, Nan Hua, Zi Yang, Jeremiah Zhe Liu, Zi Lin*\n\n**Abstract:** Traditional (unstructured) pruning methods for a Transformer model focus on regularizing the individual weights by penalizing them toward zero. In this work, we explore spectral-normalized identity priors (SNIP), a structured pruning approach that penalizes an entire residual module in a Transformer model toward an identity mapping. Our method identifies and discards unimportant non-linear mappings in the residual connections by applying a thresholding operator on the function norm. It is applicable to any structured module, including a single attention head, an entire attention block, or a feed-forward subnetwork. Furthermore, we introduce spectral normalization to stabilize the distribution of the post-activation values of the Transformer layers, further improving the pruning effectiveness of the proposed methodology. We conduct experiments with BERT on 5 GLUE benchmark tasks to demonstrate that SNIP achieves effective pruning results while maintaining comparable performance. Specifically, we improve the performance over the state-of-the-art by 0.5 to 1.0% on average at 50% compression ratio.\n\n**Proceeding:** findings-of-the-association-for-computational\n\n**Published:** 2020-10-05\n\n\n\n#### 2. KVQuant: Towards 10 Million Context Length LLM Inference with KV Cache Quantization\n\n*From Search Query: activation compression normalization*\n\n*Amir Gholami, Kurt Keutzer, Yakun Sophia Shao, Michael W. Mahoney, Hiva Mohammadzadeh, Sehoon Kim, Coleman Hooper*\n\n**Abstract:** LLMs are seeing growing use for applications such as document analysis and summarization which require large context windows, and with these large context windows KV cache activations surface as the dominant contributor to memory consumption during inference. Quantization is a promising approach for compressing KV cache activations; however, existing solutions fail to represent activations accurately in ultra-low precisions, such as sub-4-bit. In this work, we present KVQuant, which addresses this problem by incorporating novel methods for quantizing cached KV activations, including: (i) Per-Channel Key Quantization, where we adjust the dimension along which we quantize the Key activations to better match the distribution; (ii) Pre-RoPE Key Quantization, where we quantize Key activations before the rotary positional embedding to mitigate its impact on quantization; (iii) Non-Uniform KV Cache Quantization, where we derive per-layer sensitivity-weighted non-uniform datatypes that better represent the distributions; and (iv) Per-Vector Dense-and-Sparse Quantization, where we isolate outliers separately for each vector to minimize skews in quantization ranges. By applying our method to the LLaMA, Llama-2, Llama-3, and Mistral models, we achieve $<0.1$ perplexity degradation with 3-bit quantization on both Wikitext-2 and C4, outperforming existing approaches. Our method enables serving the LLaMA-7B model with a context length of up to 1 million on a single A100-80GB GPU and up to 10 million on an 8-GPU system.\n\n**Published:** 2024-01-31\n\n\n\n#### 3. Ginex: SSD-enabled Billion-scale Graph Neural Network Training on a Single Machine via Provably Optimal In-memory Caching\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization neural networks*\n\n*Jae W. Lee, Sunhong Min, Yeonhong Park*\n\n**Abstract:** Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been receiving a spotlight as a powerful tool that can effectively serve various inference tasks on graph structured data. As the size of real-world graphs continues to scale, the GNN training system faces a scalability challenge. Distributed training is a popular approach to address this challenge by scaling out CPU nodes. However, not much attention has been paid to disk-based GNN training, which can scale up the single-node system in a more cost-effective manner by leveraging high-performance storage devices like NVMe SSDs. We observe that the data movement between the main memory and the disk is the primary bottleneck in the SSD-based training system, and that the conventional GNN training pipeline is sub-optimal without taking this overhead into account. Thus, we propose Ginex, the first SSD-based GNN training system that can process billion-scale graph datasets on a single machine. Inspired by the inspector-executor execution model in compiler optimization, Ginex restructures the GNN training pipeline by separating sample and gather stages. This separation enables Ginex to realize a provably optimal replacement algorithm, known as Belady's algorithm, for caching feature vectors in memory, which account for the dominant portion of I/O accesses. According to our evaluation with four billion-scale graph datasets, Ginex achieves 2.11x higher training throughput on average (up to 2.67x at maximum) than the SSD-extended PyTorch Geometric.\n\n**Published:** 2022-08-19\n\n\n\n#### 4. Efficient Training of Retrieval Models using Negative Cache\n\n*From Search Query: cache optimization neural networks*\n\n*Sanjiv Kumar, Ruiqi Guo, Sashank Reddi, Erik Lindgren*\n\n**Abstract:** Factorized models, such as two tower neural network models, are widely used for scoring (query, document) pairs in information retrieval tasks. These models are typically trained by optimizing the model parameters to score relevant positive\" pairs higher than the irrelevantnegative\" ones. While a large set of negatives typically improves the model performance, limited computation and memory budgets place constraints on the number of negatives used during training. In this paper, we develop a novel negative sampling technique for accelerating training with softmax cross-entropy loss. By using cached (possibly stale) item embeddings, our technique enables training with a large pool of negatives with reduced memory and computation. We also develop a streaming variant of our algorithm geared towards very large datasets. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical basis for our approach by showing that updating a very small fraction of the cache at each iteration can still ensure fast convergence. Finally, we experimentally validate our approach and show that it is efficient and compares favorably with more complex, state-of-the-art approaches.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2021-12\n\n**Published:** 2021-12-01\n\n\n\n#### 5. Quantized Training of Gradient Boosting Decision Trees\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Tie-Yan Liu, Shuxin Zheng, Zhuoming Chen, Guolin Ke, Yu Shi*\n\n**Abstract:** Recent years have witnessed significant success in Gradient Boosting Decision Trees (GBDT) for a wide range of machine learning applications. Generally, a consensus about GBDT's training algorithms is gradients and statistics are computed based on high-precision floating points. In this paper, we investigate an essentially important question which has been largely ignored by the previous literature: how many bits are needed for representing gradients in training GBDT? To solve this mystery, we propose to quantize all the high-precision gradients in a very simple yet effective way in the GBDT's training algorithm. Surprisingly, both our theoretical analysis and empirical studies show that the necessary precisions of gradients without hurting any performance can be quite low, e.g., 2 or 3 bits. With low-precision gradients, most arithmetic operations in GBDT training can be replaced by integer operations of 8, 16, or 32 bits. Promisingly, these findings may pave the way for much more efficient training of GBDT from several aspects: (1) speeding up the computation of gradient statistics in histograms; (2) compressing the communication cost of high-precision statistical information during distributed training; (3) the inspiration of utilization and development of hardware architectures which well support low-precision computation for GBDT training. Benchmarked on CPUs, GPUs, and distributed clusters, we observe up to 2$\\times$ speedup of our simple quantization strategy compared with SOTA GBDT systems on extensive datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of the low-precision training of GBDT. The code will be released to the official repository of LightGBM.\n\n**Published:** 2022-07-20\n\n\n\n#### 6. Differentiable Expected Hypervolume Improvement for Parallel Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization\n\n*From Search Query: hardware efficient gradient computation*\n\n*Samuel Daulton, Maximilian Balandat, Eytan Bakshy*\n\n**Abstract:** In many real-world scenarios, decision makers seek to efficiently optimize multiple competing objectives in a sample-efficient fashion. Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (BO) is a common approach, but many of the best-performing acquisition functions do not have known analytic gradients and suffer from high computational overhead. We leverage recent advances in programming models and hardware acceleration for multi-objective BO using Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI)---an algorithm notorious for its high computational complexity. We derive a novel formulation of q-Expected Hypervolume Improvement (qEHVI), an acquisition function that extends EHVI to the parallel, constrained evaluation setting. qEHVI is an exact computation of the joint EHVI of q new candidate points (up to Monte-Carlo (MC) integration error). Whereas previous EHVI formulations rely on gradient-free acquisition optimization or approximated gradients, we compute exact gradients of the MC estimator via auto-differentiation, thereby enabling efficient and effective optimization using first-order and quasi-second-order methods. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that qEHVI is computationally tractable in many practical scenarios and outperforms state-of-the-art multi-objective BO algorithms at a fraction of their wall time.\n\n**Proceeding:** neurips-2020-12\n\n**Published:** 2020-06-09\n\n\n\n\n\n---\n## Web search results\n\n To improve the design of autoregressive language models, particularly focusing on memory efficiency, cache optimization, hardware-efficient gradient computation, and the impact of compression on training dynamics, here are some key findings and references:\n\n## Techniques for Compressing and Storing Activations in Neural Networks\n\n- The paper \"CompAct: Compressed Activations for Memory-Efficient LLM Training\" introduces a technique that compresses activations using low-rank projections, significantly reducing the memory required during the backward pass. This method stores a projected version of the activations, which are then decompressed only for the update step, leading to substantial memory savings.\n\n- Another approach discussed in \"Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models\" involves activation sparsity, where small-magnitude activations are pruned to reduce compute and memory requirements. This method is compatible with quantization and can be optimized for hardware efficiency.\n\n## Cache Optimization Strategies for Deep Learning\n\n- The \"FlashAttention\" algorithm is an example of an IO-aware design that optimizes memory access patterns. It uses tiling to reduce the number of memory reads/writes between GPU high bandwidth memory (HBM) and GPU on-chip SRAM, which is crucial for cache-friendly memory access and performance[Analysis Note, Reference 1].\n\n- Cache-friendly design is also emphasized in the context of hardware-aware optimization. Strategies such as blocking and tiling can significantly reduce memory access overhead and improve performance[Analysis Note].\n\n## Hardware-Efficient Gradient Computation Methods\n\n- The \"CompAct\" method not only compresses activations but also computes gradients within the reduced subspace, which maintains the full forward pass while reducing the memory required for the backward pass. This approach is hardware-efficient as it reduces the size of optimizer states and the compute graph.\n\n- Hardware-efficient training can also be achieved through designs like \"MA-BERT,\" which eliminates complex non-linear functions to enable hardware-friendly processing. This approach can be combined with other optimization techniques to enhance efficiency[Analysis Note, Reference 3].\n\n## Dynamic Memory Allocation in Neural Networks\n\n- While the provided sources do not explicitly discuss dynamic memory allocation, the \"CompAct\" method implies dynamic management of memory by compressing and decompressing activations as needed. This approach avoids the need to store full gradients in memory, which can be seen as a form of dynamic memory allocation.\n\n## Impact of Compression on Gradient Flow and Training Dynamics\n\n- The compression techniques, such as those in \"CompAct,\" maintain the full forward pass and compute gradients within the reduced subspace. This ensures that the gradients are accurate and do not significantly degrade the training dynamics. The method avoids additional memory overheads and ensures that the gradients are low-rank, which is crucial for maintaining training stability.\n\n- The impact of activation sparsity on gradient flow is also considered in \"Training-Free Activation Sparsity in Large Language Models.\" The method analyzes the distributional properties of activations and demonstrates that magnitude-based pruning is empirically effective without significantly affecting the gradient flow.\n\nBy integrating these techniques, researchers can improve the memory efficiency, cache optimization, and hardware efficiency of autoregressive language models, while ensuring that the compression methods do not adversely affect the training dynamics and gradient flow.\n",
